During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.CastPassable hand Josh Hutcherson leads while flanked by Matthew Lillard whose appearance is making me feel old! Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan.VerdictI'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really "Got" them which frustrates me.The concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed.Alas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention.When the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones.FIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more.RantsI weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it.BreakdownLooks the part\nMatthew Lilliard is decent here\nHutcherson always looks like he's bored\nWeak kills\nPants plot\nToo much melodrama.

The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering "Can I take my kid to see this?". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The "twist" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think "Is this a horror film?". It's not "balls-to-the-wall" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.

(This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.

I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline "cheese", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.

It's a "horror" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.

I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.

I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣

Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.

The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole "kidnapped little brother" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.

I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.

That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.

Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.

Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he "still had control of them " at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.

Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving "Five Nights at Freddy's" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience.

It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!

Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.

I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.

I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more "80's slasher" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.
## 20  My Background (I think you should know my perspective). (Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, "That's just a theory...". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final "fight" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.

Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a "who done it?" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.

Traditionally, translating video games into movies is not an easy task. It requires immense love, creativity and time from someone who truly understands and respects the source material. You, as a fan of this franchise are hoping that due care was taken to craft a faithful experience worthy of your nostalgia dollars. I would love to say that's exactly what this film is, that it brings to life all those memories from your childhood with the nurturing warmth they deserve. I wish I could say this is a new horror icon. Unfortunately I can not.Far from the care necessary to produce a coherent rendition of the jump scare laden franchise, this is a film unsure of what it wants to be, what it is about or how it should get there. The writing is careless to the point of becoming disrespectful to the very nostalgia they used to draw you in. What we get is a film that is hard to justify as a Five Nights at Freddy's film devoid of any jump scares, instead manicly switching between genres and themes in some kind of existential identity crisis. It's sometimes a family drama about a child custody battle, before it switches into a sci-fi dreamscape nior about a lost brother, a gritty romance, a coming of age story and even a heist movie. Sometimes it happens to be set in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but that is only for a third or less of the film. It does contain Freddy and his band of ghoulish friends, but they mostly just stand around like easter eggs in the background of another movie.Little in Five Nights at Freddy's makes sense, starting with its title, since lead character Mike only spends three nights in the building. The events which take place have no consequences, in the films universe as if they were in a 90s sitcom that resets after every episode. Crimes are committed, but nobody cares or remembers. Conversations are had, that are immediately forgotten. The characters have unrealistic and unconvincing conversations that betray the film's low-quality writing. Nobody does their job and it does not matter. Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation disaster lacking in even the most basic of stakes or reason for the audience to care.What about fun, you may ask. Surely, Five Nights at Freddy's compensates for its lack of coherence with some humorous and self-referential fun. Well, you are out of luck there too. The film wastes so much time switching between its multiple identities that the characters end up doing nothing but talking in disconnected monologues passed each other or sleeping for most of the film. When a horror franchise devotes more time to watching a character sleep than to anything resembling action, you know you have wasted your money.As Scott Cawthon, the creator of this franchise, I would feel outraged by the way writer/director Emma Tammi has ruined this IP. It is not hard to envision legal action coming soon, the film is just that terrible. Five Nights at Freddy's reminds us after a decade of Marvel comic film adoptions, that if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself.

The characters were moronic and unbelievable, it had nothing you want from a five nights at Freddy's movie(No mystery, intrigue, no jumpscares) and instead decided to waste its time on an annoying child and a whiney man who couldn't emote if his life depended on it.I just can't help but think this movie should have been a crime mystery movie, imagine a story where you follow a detective investigating missing children and that eventually leads him onto William aftons trail and freddy's. Something more akin to Seven than whatever the hell this trash movie was.

I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.

The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.

During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.CastPassable hand Josh Hutcherson leads while flanked by Matthew Lillard whose appearance is making me feel old! Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan.VerdictI'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really "Got" them which frustrates me.The concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed.Alas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention.When the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones.FIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more.RantsI weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it.BreakdownLooks the part\nMatthew Lilliard is decent here\nHutcherson always looks like he's bored\nWeak kills\nPants plot\nToo much melodrama.

The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering "Can I take my kid to see this?". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The "twist" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think "Is this a horror film?". It's not "balls-to-the-wall" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.

(This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.

I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline "cheese", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.

It's a "horror" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.

I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.

I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣

Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.

The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole "kidnapped little brother" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.

I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.

That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.

Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.

Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he "still had control of them " at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.

Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving "Five Nights at Freddy's" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience.

It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!

Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.

I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.

I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more "80's slasher" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.
## 45  My Background (I think you should know my perspective). (Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, "That's just a theory...". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final "fight" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.

Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a "who done it?" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.

Traditionally, translating video games into movies is not an easy task. It requires immense love, creativity and time from someone who truly understands and respects the source material. You, as a fan of this franchise are hoping that due care was taken to craft a faithful experience worthy of your nostalgia dollars. I would love to say that's exactly what this film is, that it brings to life all those memories from your childhood with the nurturing warmth they deserve. I wish I could say this is a new horror icon. Unfortunately I can not.Far from the care necessary to produce a coherent rendition of the jump scare laden franchise, this is a film unsure of what it wants to be, what it is about or how it should get there. The writing is careless to the point of becoming disrespectful to the very nostalgia they used to draw you in. What we get is a film that is hard to justify as a Five Nights at Freddy's film devoid of any jump scares, instead manicly switching between genres and themes in some kind of existential identity crisis. It's sometimes a family drama about a child custody battle, before it switches into a sci-fi dreamscape nior about a lost brother, a gritty romance, a coming of age story and even a heist movie. Sometimes it happens to be set in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but that is only for a third or less of the film. It does contain Freddy and his band of ghoulish friends, but they mostly just stand around like easter eggs in the background of another movie.Little in Five Nights at Freddy's makes sense, starting with its title, since lead character Mike only spends three nights in the building. The events which take place have no consequences, in the films universe as if they were in a 90s sitcom that resets after every episode. Crimes are committed, but nobody cares or remembers. Conversations are had, that are immediately forgotten. The characters have unrealistic and unconvincing conversations that betray the film's low-quality writing. Nobody does their job and it does not matter. Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation disaster lacking in even the most basic of stakes or reason for the audience to care.What about fun, you may ask. Surely, Five Nights at Freddy's compensates for its lack of coherence with some humorous and self-referential fun. Well, you are out of luck there too. The film wastes so much time switching between its multiple identities that the characters end up doing nothing but talking in disconnected monologues passed each other or sleeping for most of the film. When a horror franchise devotes more time to watching a character sleep than to anything resembling action, you know you have wasted your money.As Scott Cawthon, the creator of this franchise, I would feel outraged by the way writer/director Emma Tammi has ruined this IP. It is not hard to envision legal action coming soon, the film is just that terrible. Five Nights at Freddy's reminds us after a decade of Marvel comic film adoptions, that if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself.

The characters were moronic and unbelievable, it had nothing you want from a five nights at Freddy's movie(No mystery, intrigue, no jumpscares) and instead decided to waste its time on an annoying child and a whiney man who couldn't emote if his life depended on it.I just can't help but think this movie should have been a crime mystery movie, imagine a story where you follow a detective investigating missing children and that eventually leads him onto William aftons trail and freddy's. Something more akin to Seven than whatever the hell this trash movie was.

I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.

The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.

During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.CastPassable hand Josh Hutcherson leads while flanked by Matthew Lillard whose appearance is making me feel old! Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan.VerdictI'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really "Got" them which frustrates me.The concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed.Alas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention.When the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones.FIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more.RantsI weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it.BreakdownLooks the part\nMatthew Lilliard is decent here\nHutcherson always looks like he's bored\nWeak kills\nPants plot\nToo much melodrama.

The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering "Can I take my kid to see this?". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The "twist" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think "Is this a horror film?". It's not "balls-to-the-wall" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.

(This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.

I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline "cheese", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.

It's a "horror" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.

I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.

I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣

Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.

The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole "kidnapped little brother" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.

I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.

That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.

Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.

Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he "still had control of them " at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.

Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving "Five Nights at Freddy's" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience.

It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!

Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.

I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.

I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more "80's slasher" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.
## 70  My Background (I think you should know my perspective). (Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, "That's just a theory...". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final "fight" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.

Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a "who done it?" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.

Traditionally, translating video games into movies is not an easy task. It requires immense love, creativity and time from someone who truly understands and respects the source material. You, as a fan of this franchise are hoping that due care was taken to craft a faithful experience worthy of your nostalgia dollars. I would love to say that's exactly what this film is, that it brings to life all those memories from your childhood with the nurturing warmth they deserve. I wish I could say this is a new horror icon. Unfortunately I can not.Far from the care necessary to produce a coherent rendition of the jump scare laden franchise, this is a film unsure of what it wants to be, what it is about or how it should get there. The writing is careless to the point of becoming disrespectful to the very nostalgia they used to draw you in. What we get is a film that is hard to justify as a Five Nights at Freddy's film devoid of any jump scares, instead manicly switching between genres and themes in some kind of existential identity crisis. It's sometimes a family drama about a child custody battle, before it switches into a sci-fi dreamscape nior about a lost brother, a gritty romance, a coming of age story and even a heist movie. Sometimes it happens to be set in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but that is only for a third or less of the film. It does contain Freddy and his band of ghoulish friends, but they mostly just stand around like easter eggs in the background of another movie.Little in Five Nights at Freddy's makes sense, starting with its title, since lead character Mike only spends three nights in the building. The events which take place have no consequences, in the films universe as if they were in a 90s sitcom that resets after every episode. Crimes are committed, but nobody cares or remembers. Conversations are had, that are immediately forgotten. The characters have unrealistic and unconvincing conversations that betray the film's low-quality writing. Nobody does their job and it does not matter. Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation disaster lacking in even the most basic of stakes or reason for the audience to care.What about fun, you may ask. Surely, Five Nights at Freddy's compensates for its lack of coherence with some humorous and self-referential fun. Well, you are out of luck there too. The film wastes so much time switching between its multiple identities that the characters end up doing nothing but talking in disconnected monologues passed each other or sleeping for most of the film. When a horror franchise devotes more time to watching a character sleep than to anything resembling action, you know you have wasted your money.As Scott Cawthon, the creator of this franchise, I would feel outraged by the way writer/director Emma Tammi has ruined this IP. It is not hard to envision legal action coming soon, the film is just that terrible. Five Nights at Freddy's reminds us after a decade of Marvel comic film adoptions, that if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself.

The characters were moronic and unbelievable, it had nothing you want from a five nights at Freddy's movie(No mystery, intrigue, no jumpscares) and instead decided to waste its time on an annoying child and a whiney man who couldn't emote if his life depended on it.I just can't help but think this movie should have been a crime mystery movie, imagine a story where you follow a detective investigating missing children and that eventually leads him onto William aftons trail and freddy's. Something more akin to Seven than whatever the hell this trash movie was.

I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.

The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.

During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.CastPassable hand Josh Hutcherson leads while flanked by Matthew Lillard whose appearance is making me feel old! Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan.VerdictI'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really "Got" them which frustrates me.The concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed.Alas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention.When the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones.FIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more.RantsI weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it.BreakdownLooks the part\nMatthew Lilliard is decent here\nHutcherson always looks like he's bored\nWeak kills\nPants plot\nToo much melodrama.

The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering "Can I take my kid to see this?". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The "twist" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think "Is this a horror film?". It's not "balls-to-the-wall" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.

(This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.

I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline "cheese", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.

It's a "horror" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.

I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.

I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣

Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.

The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole "kidnapped little brother" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.

I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.

That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.

Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.

Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he "still had control of them " at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.

Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving "Five Nights at Freddy's" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience.

It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!

Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.

I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.

I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more "80's slasher" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.
## 95  My Background (I think you should know my perspective). (Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, "That's just a theory...". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final "fight" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.

Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a "who done it?" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.

Traditionally, translating video games into movies is not an easy task. It requires immense love, creativity and time from someone who truly understands and respects the source material. You, as a fan of this franchise are hoping that due care was taken to craft a faithful experience worthy of your nostalgia dollars. I would love to say that's exactly what this film is, that it brings to life all those memories from your childhood with the nurturing warmth they deserve. I wish I could say this is a new horror icon. Unfortunately I can not.Far from the care necessary to produce a coherent rendition of the jump scare laden franchise, this is a film unsure of what it wants to be, what it is about or how it should get there. The writing is careless to the point of becoming disrespectful to the very nostalgia they used to draw you in. What we get is a film that is hard to justify as a Five Nights at Freddy's film devoid of any jump scares, instead manicly switching between genres and themes in some kind of existential identity crisis. It's sometimes a family drama about a child custody battle, before it switches into a sci-fi dreamscape nior about a lost brother, a gritty romance, a coming of age story and even a heist movie. Sometimes it happens to be set in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but that is only for a third or less of the film. It does contain Freddy and his band of ghoulish friends, but they mostly just stand around like easter eggs in the background of another movie.Little in Five Nights at Freddy's makes sense, starting with its title, since lead character Mike only spends three nights in the building. The events which take place have no consequences, in the films universe as if they were in a 90s sitcom that resets after every episode. Crimes are committed, but nobody cares or remembers. Conversations are had, that are immediately forgotten. The characters have unrealistic and unconvincing conversations that betray the film's low-quality writing. Nobody does their job and it does not matter. Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation disaster lacking in even the most basic of stakes or reason for the audience to care.What about fun, you may ask. Surely, Five Nights at Freddy's compensates for its lack of coherence with some humorous and self-referential fun. Well, you are out of luck there too. The film wastes so much time switching between its multiple identities that the characters end up doing nothing but talking in disconnected monologues passed each other or sleeping for most of the film. When a horror franchise devotes more time to watching a character sleep than to anything resembling action, you know you have wasted your money.As Scott Cawthon, the creator of this franchise, I would feel outraged by the way writer/director Emma Tammi has ruined this IP. It is not hard to envision legal action coming soon, the film is just that terrible. Five Nights at Freddy's reminds us after a decade of Marvel comic film adoptions, that if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself.

The characters were moronic and unbelievable, it had nothing you want from a five nights at Freddy's movie(No mystery, intrigue, no jumpscares) and instead decided to waste its time on an annoying child and a whiney man who couldn't emote if his life depended on it.I just can't help but think this movie should have been a crime mystery movie, imagine a story where you follow a detective investigating missing children and that eventually leads him onto William aftons trail and freddy's. Something more akin to Seven than whatever the hell this trash movie was.

I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.

The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.

During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.CastPassable hand Josh Hutcherson leads while flanked by Matthew Lillard whose appearance is making me feel old! Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan.VerdictI'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really "Got" them which frustrates me.The concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed.Alas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention.When the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones.FIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more.RantsI weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it.BreakdownLooks the part\nMatthew Lilliard is decent here\nHutcherson always looks like he's bored\nWeak kills\nPants plot\nToo much melodrama.

The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering "Can I take my kid to see this?". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The "twist" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think "Is this a horror film?". It's not "balls-to-the-wall" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.

(This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.

I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline "cheese", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.

It's a "horror" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.

I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.

I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣

Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.

The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole "kidnapped little brother" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.

I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.

That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.

Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.

Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he "still had control of them " at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.

Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving "Five Nights at Freddy's" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience.

It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!

Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.

I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.

I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more "80's slasher" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.
## 120 My Background (I think you should know my perspective). (Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, "That's just a theory...". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final "fight" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.

Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a "who done it?" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.

Traditionally, translating video games into movies is not an easy task. It requires immense love, creativity and time from someone who truly understands and respects the source material. You, as a fan of this franchise are hoping that due care was taken to craft a faithful experience worthy of your nostalgia dollars. I would love to say that's exactly what this film is, that it brings to life all those memories from your childhood with the nurturing warmth they deserve. I wish I could say this is a new horror icon. Unfortunately I can not.Far from the care necessary to produce a coherent rendition of the jump scare laden franchise, this is a film unsure of what it wants to be, what it is about or how it should get there. The writing is careless to the point of becoming disrespectful to the very nostalgia they used to draw you in. What we get is a film that is hard to justify as a Five Nights at Freddy's film devoid of any jump scares, instead manicly switching between genres and themes in some kind of existential identity crisis. It's sometimes a family drama about a child custody battle, before it switches into a sci-fi dreamscape nior about a lost brother, a gritty romance, a coming of age story and even a heist movie. Sometimes it happens to be set in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but that is only for a third or less of the film. It does contain Freddy and his band of ghoulish friends, but they mostly just stand around like easter eggs in the background of another movie.Little in Five Nights at Freddy's makes sense, starting with its title, since lead character Mike only spends three nights in the building. The events which take place have no consequences, in the films universe as if they were in a 90s sitcom that resets after every episode. Crimes are committed, but nobody cares or remembers. Conversations are had, that are immediately forgotten. The characters have unrealistic and unconvincing conversations that betray the film's low-quality writing. Nobody does their job and it does not matter. Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation disaster lacking in even the most basic of stakes or reason for the audience to care.What about fun, you may ask. Surely, Five Nights at Freddy's compensates for its lack of coherence with some humorous and self-referential fun. Well, you are out of luck there too. The film wastes so much time switching between its multiple identities that the characters end up doing nothing but talking in disconnected monologues passed each other or sleeping for most of the film. When a horror franchise devotes more time to watching a character sleep than to anything resembling action, you know you have wasted your money.As Scott Cawthon, the creator of this franchise, I would feel outraged by the way writer/director Emma Tammi has ruined this IP. It is not hard to envision legal action coming soon, the film is just that terrible. Five Nights at Freddy's reminds us after a decade of Marvel comic film adoptions, that if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself.

The characters were moronic and unbelievable, it had nothing you want from a five nights at Freddy's movie(No mystery, intrigue, no jumpscares) and instead decided to waste its time on an annoying child and a whiney man who couldn't emote if his life depended on it.I just can't help but think this movie should have been a crime mystery movie, imagine a story where you follow a detective investigating missing children and that eventually leads him onto William aftons trail and freddy's. Something more akin to Seven than whatever the hell this trash movie was.

I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.

The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.

During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.CastPassable hand Josh Hutcherson leads while flanked by Matthew Lillard whose appearance is making me feel old! Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan.VerdictI'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really "Got" them which frustrates me.The concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed.Alas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention.When the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones.FIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more.RantsI weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it.BreakdownLooks the part\nMatthew Lilliard is decent here\nHutcherson always looks like he's bored\nWeak kills\nPants plot\nToo much melodrama.

The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering "Can I take my kid to see this?". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The "twist" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think "Is this a horror film?". It's not "balls-to-the-wall" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.

(This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.

I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline "cheese", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.

It's a "horror" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.

I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.

I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣

Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.

The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole "kidnapped little brother" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.

I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.

That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.

Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.

Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he "still had control of them " at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.

Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving "Five Nights at Freddy's" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience.

It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!

Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.

I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.

I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more "80's slasher" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.
## 145 My Background (I think you should know my perspective). (Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, "That's just a theory...". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final "fight" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.

Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a "who done it?" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.

Traditionally, translating video games into movies is not an easy task. It requires immense love, creativity and time from someone who truly understands and respects the source material. You, as a fan of this franchise are hoping that due care was taken to craft a faithful experience worthy of your nostalgia dollars. I would love to say that's exactly what this film is, that it brings to life all those memories from your childhood with the nurturing warmth they deserve. I wish I could say this is a new horror icon. Unfortunately I can not.Far from the care necessary to produce a coherent rendition of the jump scare laden franchise, this is a film unsure of what it wants to be, what it is about or how it should get there. The writing is careless to the point of becoming disrespectful to the very nostalgia they used to draw you in. What we get is a film that is hard to justify as a Five Nights at Freddy's film devoid of any jump scares, instead manicly switching between genres and themes in some kind of existential identity crisis. It's sometimes a family drama about a child custody battle, before it switches into a sci-fi dreamscape nior about a lost brother, a gritty romance, a coming of age story and even a heist movie. Sometimes it happens to be set in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but that is only for a third or less of the film. It does contain Freddy and his band of ghoulish friends, but they mostly just stand around like easter eggs in the background of another movie.Little in Five Nights at Freddy's makes sense, starting with its title, since lead character Mike only spends three nights in the building. The events which take place have no consequences, in the films universe as if they were in a 90s sitcom that resets after every episode. Crimes are committed, but nobody cares or remembers. Conversations are had, that are immediately forgotten. The characters have unrealistic and unconvincing conversations that betray the film's low-quality writing. Nobody does their job and it does not matter. Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation disaster lacking in even the most basic of stakes or reason for the audience to care.What about fun, you may ask. Surely, Five Nights at Freddy's compensates for its lack of coherence with some humorous and self-referential fun. Well, you are out of luck there too. The film wastes so much time switching between its multiple identities that the characters end up doing nothing but talking in disconnected monologues passed each other or sleeping for most of the film. When a horror franchise devotes more time to watching a character sleep than to anything resembling action, you know you have wasted your money.As Scott Cawthon, the creator of this franchise, I would feel outraged by the way writer/director Emma Tammi has ruined this IP. It is not hard to envision legal action coming soon, the film is just that terrible. Five Nights at Freddy's reminds us after a decade of Marvel comic film adoptions, that if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself.

The characters were moronic and unbelievable, it had nothing you want from a five nights at Freddy's movie(No mystery, intrigue, no jumpscares) and instead decided to waste its time on an annoying child and a whiney man who couldn't emote if his life depended on it.I just can't help but think this movie should have been a crime mystery movie, imagine a story where you follow a detective investigating missing children and that eventually leads him onto William aftons trail and freddy's. Something more akin to Seven than whatever the hell this trash movie was.

I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.

The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.

During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.CastPassable hand Josh Hutcherson leads while flanked by Matthew Lillard whose appearance is making me feel old! Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan.VerdictI'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really "Got" them which frustrates me.The concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed.Alas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention.When the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones.FIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more.RantsI weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it.BreakdownLooks the part\nMatthew Lilliard is decent here\nHutcherson always looks like he's bored\nWeak kills\nPants plot\nToo much melodrama.

The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering "Can I take my kid to see this?". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The "twist" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think "Is this a horror film?". It's not "balls-to-the-wall" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.

(This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.

I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline "cheese", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.

It's a "horror" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.

I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.

I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣

Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.

The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole "kidnapped little brother" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.

I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.

That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.

Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.

Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he "still had control of them " at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.

Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving "Five Nights at Freddy's" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience.

It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!

Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.

I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.

I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more "80's slasher" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.
## 170 My Background (I think you should know my perspective). (Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, "That's just a theory...". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final "fight" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.

Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a "who done it?" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.

Traditionally, translating video games into movies is not an easy task. It requires immense love, creativity and time from someone who truly understands and respects the source material. You, as a fan of this franchise are hoping that due care was taken to craft a faithful experience worthy of your nostalgia dollars. I would love to say that's exactly what this film is, that it brings to life all those memories from your childhood with the nurturing warmth they deserve. I wish I could say this is a new horror icon. Unfortunately I can not.Far from the care necessary to produce a coherent rendition of the jump scare laden franchise, this is a film unsure of what it wants to be, what it is about or how it should get there. The writing is careless to the point of becoming disrespectful to the very nostalgia they used to draw you in. What we get is a film that is hard to justify as a Five Nights at Freddy's film devoid of any jump scares, instead manicly switching between genres and themes in some kind of existential identity crisis. It's sometimes a family drama about a child custody battle, before it switches into a sci-fi dreamscape nior about a lost brother, a gritty romance, a coming of age story and even a heist movie. Sometimes it happens to be set in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but that is only for a third or less of the film. It does contain Freddy and his band of ghoulish friends, but they mostly just stand around like easter eggs in the background of another movie.Little in Five Nights at Freddy's makes sense, starting with its title, since lead character Mike only spends three nights in the building. The events which take place have no consequences, in the films universe as if they were in a 90s sitcom that resets after every episode. Crimes are committed, but nobody cares or remembers. Conversations are had, that are immediately forgotten. The characters have unrealistic and unconvincing conversations that betray the film's low-quality writing. Nobody does their job and it does not matter. Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation disaster lacking in even the most basic of stakes or reason for the audience to care.What about fun, you may ask. Surely, Five Nights at Freddy's compensates for its lack of coherence with some humorous and self-referential fun. Well, you are out of luck there too. The film wastes so much time switching between its multiple identities that the characters end up doing nothing but talking in disconnected monologues passed each other or sleeping for most of the film. When a horror franchise devotes more time to watching a character sleep than to anything resembling action, you know you have wasted your money.As Scott Cawthon, the creator of this franchise, I would feel outraged by the way writer/director Emma Tammi has ruined this IP. It is not hard to envision legal action coming soon, the film is just that terrible. Five Nights at Freddy's reminds us after a decade of Marvel comic film adoptions, that if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself.

The characters were moronic and unbelievable, it had nothing you want from a five nights at Freddy's movie(No mystery, intrigue, no jumpscares) and instead decided to waste its time on an annoying child and a whiney man who couldn't emote if his life depended on it.I just can't help but think this movie should have been a crime mystery movie, imagine a story where you follow a detective investigating missing children and that eventually leads him onto William aftons trail and freddy's. Something more akin to Seven than whatever the hell this trash movie was.

I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.

The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.

During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.CastPassable hand Josh Hutcherson leads while flanked by Matthew Lillard whose appearance is making me feel old! Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan.VerdictI'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really "Got" them which frustrates me.The concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed.Alas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention.When the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones.FIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more.RantsI weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it.BreakdownLooks the part\nMatthew Lilliard is decent here\nHutcherson always looks like he's bored\nWeak kills\nPants plot\nToo much melodrama.

The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering "Can I take my kid to see this?". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The "twist" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think "Is this a horror film?". It's not "balls-to-the-wall" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.

(This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.

I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline "cheese", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.

It's a "horror" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.

I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.

I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣

Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.

The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole "kidnapped little brother" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.

I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.

That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.

Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.

Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he "still had control of them " at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.

Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving "Five Nights at Freddy's" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience.

It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!

Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.

I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.

I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more "80's slasher" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.
## 195 My Background (I think you should know my perspective). (Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, "That's just a theory...". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final "fight" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.

Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a "who done it?" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.

Traditionally, translating video games into movies is not an easy task. It requires immense love, creativity and time from someone who truly understands and respects the source material. You, as a fan of this franchise are hoping that due care was taken to craft a faithful experience worthy of your nostalgia dollars. I would love to say that's exactly what this film is, that it brings to life all those memories from your childhood with the nurturing warmth they deserve. I wish I could say this is a new horror icon. Unfortunately I can not.Far from the care necessary to produce a coherent rendition of the jump scare laden franchise, this is a film unsure of what it wants to be, what it is about or how it should get there. The writing is careless to the point of becoming disrespectful to the very nostalgia they used to draw you in. What we get is a film that is hard to justify as a Five Nights at Freddy's film devoid of any jump scares, instead manicly switching between genres and themes in some kind of existential identity crisis. It's sometimes a family drama about a child custody battle, before it switches into a sci-fi dreamscape nior about a lost brother, a gritty romance, a coming of age story and even a heist movie. Sometimes it happens to be set in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but that is only for a third or less of the film. It does contain Freddy and his band of ghoulish friends, but they mostly just stand around like easter eggs in the background of another movie.Little in Five Nights at Freddy's makes sense, starting with its title, since lead character Mike only spends three nights in the building. The events which take place have no consequences, in the films universe as if they were in a 90s sitcom that resets after every episode. Crimes are committed, but nobody cares or remembers. Conversations are had, that are immediately forgotten. The characters have unrealistic and unconvincing conversations that betray the film's low-quality writing. Nobody does their job and it does not matter. Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation disaster lacking in even the most basic of stakes or reason for the audience to care.What about fun, you may ask. Surely, Five Nights at Freddy's compensates for its lack of coherence with some humorous and self-referential fun. Well, you are out of luck there too. The film wastes so much time switching between its multiple identities that the characters end up doing nothing but talking in disconnected monologues passed each other or sleeping for most of the film. When a horror franchise devotes more time to watching a character sleep than to anything resembling action, you know you have wasted your money.As Scott Cawthon, the creator of this franchise, I would feel outraged by the way writer/director Emma Tammi has ruined this IP. It is not hard to envision legal action coming soon, the film is just that terrible. Five Nights at Freddy's reminds us after a decade of Marvel comic film adoptions, that if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself.

The characters were moronic and unbelievable, it had nothing you want from a five nights at Freddy's movie(No mystery, intrigue, no jumpscares) and instead decided to waste its time on an annoying child and a whiney man who couldn't emote if his life depended on it.I just can't help but think this movie should have been a crime mystery movie, imagine a story where you follow a detective investigating missing children and that eventually leads him onto William aftons trail and freddy's. Something more akin to Seven than whatever the hell this trash movie was.

I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.

The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.

During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.CastPassable hand Josh Hutcherson leads while flanked by Matthew Lillard whose appearance is making me feel old! Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan.VerdictI'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really "Got" them which frustrates me.The concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed.Alas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention.When the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones.FIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more.RantsI weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it.BreakdownLooks the part\nMatthew Lilliard is decent here\nHutcherson always looks like he's bored\nWeak kills\nPants plot\nToo much melodrama.

The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering "Can I take my kid to see this?". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The "twist" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think "Is this a horror film?". It's not "balls-to-the-wall" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.

(This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.

I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline "cheese", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.

It's a "horror" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.

I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.

I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣

Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.

The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole "kidnapped little brother" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.

I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.

That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.

Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.

Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he "still had control of them " at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.

Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving "Five Nights at Freddy's" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience.

It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!

Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.

I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.

I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more "80's slasher" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.
## 220 My Background (I think you should know my perspective). (Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, "That's just a theory...". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final "fight" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.

Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a "who done it?" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.

Traditionally, translating video games into movies is not an easy task. It requires immense love, creativity and time from someone who truly understands and respects the source material. You, as a fan of this franchise are hoping that due care was taken to craft a faithful experience worthy of your nostalgia dollars. I would love to say that's exactly what this film is, that it brings to life all those memories from your childhood with the nurturing warmth they deserve. I wish I could say this is a new horror icon. Unfortunately I can not.Far from the care necessary to produce a coherent rendition of the jump scare laden franchise, this is a film unsure of what it wants to be, what it is about or how it should get there. The writing is careless to the point of becoming disrespectful to the very nostalgia they used to draw you in. What we get is a film that is hard to justify as a Five Nights at Freddy's film devoid of any jump scares, instead manicly switching between genres and themes in some kind of existential identity crisis. It's sometimes a family drama about a child custody battle, before it switches into a sci-fi dreamscape nior about a lost brother, a gritty romance, a coming of age story and even a heist movie. Sometimes it happens to be set in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but that is only for a third or less of the film. It does contain Freddy and his band of ghoulish friends, but they mostly just stand around like easter eggs in the background of another movie.Little in Five Nights at Freddy's makes sense, starting with its title, since lead character Mike only spends three nights in the building. The events which take place have no consequences, in the films universe as if they were in a 90s sitcom that resets after every episode. Crimes are committed, but nobody cares or remembers. Conversations are had, that are immediately forgotten. The characters have unrealistic and unconvincing conversations that betray the film's low-quality writing. Nobody does their job and it does not matter. Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation disaster lacking in even the most basic of stakes or reason for the audience to care.What about fun, you may ask. Surely, Five Nights at Freddy's compensates for its lack of coherence with some humorous and self-referential fun. Well, you are out of luck there too. The film wastes so much time switching between its multiple identities that the characters end up doing nothing but talking in disconnected monologues passed each other or sleeping for most of the film. When a horror franchise devotes more time to watching a character sleep than to anything resembling action, you know you have wasted your money.As Scott Cawthon, the creator of this franchise, I would feel outraged by the way writer/director Emma Tammi has ruined this IP. It is not hard to envision legal action coming soon, the film is just that terrible. Five Nights at Freddy's reminds us after a decade of Marvel comic film adoptions, that if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself.

The characters were moronic and unbelievable, it had nothing you want from a five nights at Freddy's movie(No mystery, intrigue, no jumpscares) and instead decided to waste its time on an annoying child and a whiney man who couldn't emote if his life depended on it.I just can't help but think this movie should have been a crime mystery movie, imagine a story where you follow a detective investigating missing children and that eventually leads him onto William aftons trail and freddy's. Something more akin to Seven than whatever the hell this trash movie was.

I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.

The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.

During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.CastPassable hand Josh Hutcherson leads while flanked by Matthew Lillard whose appearance is making me feel old! Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan.VerdictI'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really "Got" them which frustrates me.The concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed.Alas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention.When the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones.FIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more.RantsI weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it.BreakdownLooks the part\nMatthew Lilliard is decent here\nHutcherson always looks like he's bored\nWeak kills\nPants plot\nToo much melodrama.

The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering "Can I take my kid to see this?". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The "twist" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think "Is this a horror film?". It's not "balls-to-the-wall" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.

(This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.

I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline "cheese", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.

It's a "horror" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.

I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.

I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣

Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.

The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole "kidnapped little brother" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.

I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.

That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.

Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.

Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he "still had control of them " at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.

Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving "Five Nights at Freddy's" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience.

It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!

Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.

I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.

I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more "80's slasher" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.
## 245 My Background (I think you should know my perspective). (Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, "That's just a theory...". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final "fight" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.

Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a "who done it?" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.

Traditionally, translating video games into movies is not an easy task. It requires immense love, creativity and time from someone who truly understands and respects the source material. You, as a fan of this franchise are hoping that due care was taken to craft a faithful experience worthy of your nostalgia dollars. I would love to say that's exactly what this film is, that it brings to life all those memories from your childhood with the nurturing warmth they deserve. I wish I could say this is a new horror icon. Unfortunately I can not.Far from the care necessary to produce a coherent rendition of the jump scare laden franchise, this is a film unsure of what it wants to be, what it is about or how it should get there. The writing is careless to the point of becoming disrespectful to the very nostalgia they used to draw you in. What we get is a film that is hard to justify as a Five Nights at Freddy's film devoid of any jump scares, instead manicly switching between genres and themes in some kind of existential identity crisis. It's sometimes a family drama about a child custody battle, before it switches into a sci-fi dreamscape nior about a lost brother, a gritty romance, a coming of age story and even a heist movie. Sometimes it happens to be set in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but that is only for a third or less of the film. It does contain Freddy and his band of ghoulish friends, but they mostly just stand around like easter eggs in the background of another movie.Little in Five Nights at Freddy's makes sense, starting with its title, since lead character Mike only spends three nights in the building. The events which take place have no consequences, in the films universe as if they were in a 90s sitcom that resets after every episode. Crimes are committed, but nobody cares or remembers. Conversations are had, that are immediately forgotten. The characters have unrealistic and unconvincing conversations that betray the film's low-quality writing. Nobody does their job and it does not matter. Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation disaster lacking in even the most basic of stakes or reason for the audience to care.What about fun, you may ask. Surely, Five Nights at Freddy's compensates for its lack of coherence with some humorous and self-referential fun. Well, you are out of luck there too. The film wastes so much time switching between its multiple identities that the characters end up doing nothing but talking in disconnected monologues passed each other or sleeping for most of the film. When a horror franchise devotes more time to watching a character sleep than to anything resembling action, you know you have wasted your money.As Scott Cawthon, the creator of this franchise, I would feel outraged by the way writer/director Emma Tammi has ruined this IP. It is not hard to envision legal action coming soon, the film is just that terrible. Five Nights at Freddy's reminds us after a decade of Marvel comic film adoptions, that if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself.

The characters were moronic and unbelievable, it had nothing you want from a five nights at Freddy's movie(No mystery, intrigue, no jumpscares) and instead decided to waste its time on an annoying child and a whiney man who couldn't emote if his life depended on it.I just can't help but think this movie should have been a crime mystery movie, imagine a story where you follow a detective investigating missing children and that eventually leads him onto William aftons trail and freddy's. Something more akin to Seven than whatever the hell this trash movie was.

I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.

The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.

During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.CastPassable hand Josh Hutcherson leads while flanked by Matthew Lillard whose appearance is making me feel old! Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan.VerdictI'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really "Got" them which frustrates me.The concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed.Alas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention.When the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones.FIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more.RantsI weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it.BreakdownLooks the part\nMatthew Lilliard is decent here\nHutcherson always looks like he's bored\nWeak kills\nPants plot\nToo much melodrama.

The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering "Can I take my kid to see this?". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The "twist" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think "Is this a horror film?". It's not "balls-to-the-wall" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.

(This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.

I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline "cheese", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.

It's a "horror" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.

I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.

I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣

Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.

The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole "kidnapped little brother" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.

I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.

That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.

Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.

Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he "still had control of them " at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.

Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving "Five Nights at Freddy's" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience.

It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!

Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.

I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.

I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more "80's slasher" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.
## 270 My Background (I think you should know my perspective). (Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, "That's just a theory...". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final "fight" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.

Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a "who done it?" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.

Traditionally, translating video games into movies is not an easy task. It requires immense love, creativity and time from someone who truly understands and respects the source material. You, as a fan of this franchise are hoping that due care was taken to craft a faithful experience worthy of your nostalgia dollars. I would love to say that's exactly what this film is, that it brings to life all those memories from your childhood with the nurturing warmth they deserve. I wish I could say this is a new horror icon. Unfortunately I can not.Far from the care necessary to produce a coherent rendition of the jump scare laden franchise, this is a film unsure of what it wants to be, what it is about or how it should get there. The writing is careless to the point of becoming disrespectful to the very nostalgia they used to draw you in. What we get is a film that is hard to justify as a Five Nights at Freddy's film devoid of any jump scares, instead manicly switching between genres and themes in some kind of existential identity crisis. It's sometimes a family drama about a child custody battle, before it switches into a sci-fi dreamscape nior about a lost brother, a gritty romance, a coming of age story and even a heist movie. Sometimes it happens to be set in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but that is only for a third or less of the film. It does contain Freddy and his band of ghoulish friends, but they mostly just stand around like easter eggs in the background of another movie.Little in Five Nights at Freddy's makes sense, starting with its title, since lead character Mike only spends three nights in the building. The events which take place have no consequences, in the films universe as if they were in a 90s sitcom that resets after every episode. Crimes are committed, but nobody cares or remembers. Conversations are had, that are immediately forgotten. The characters have unrealistic and unconvincing conversations that betray the film's low-quality writing. Nobody does their job and it does not matter. Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation disaster lacking in even the most basic of stakes or reason for the audience to care.What about fun, you may ask. Surely, Five Nights at Freddy's compensates for its lack of coherence with some humorous and self-referential fun. Well, you are out of luck there too. The film wastes so much time switching between its multiple identities that the characters end up doing nothing but talking in disconnected monologues passed each other or sleeping for most of the film. When a horror franchise devotes more time to watching a character sleep than to anything resembling action, you know you have wasted your money.As Scott Cawthon, the creator of this franchise, I would feel outraged by the way writer/director Emma Tammi has ruined this IP. It is not hard to envision legal action coming soon, the film is just that terrible. Five Nights at Freddy's reminds us after a decade of Marvel comic film adoptions, that if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself.

The characters were moronic and unbelievable, it had nothing you want from a five nights at Freddy's movie(No mystery, intrigue, no jumpscares) and instead decided to waste its time on an annoying child and a whiney man who couldn't emote if his life depended on it.I just can't help but think this movie should have been a crime mystery movie, imagine a story where you follow a detective investigating missing children and that eventually leads him onto William aftons trail and freddy's. Something more akin to Seven than whatever the hell this trash movie was.

I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.

The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.

During his first night on the job, he realizes that the night shift won't be so easy to get through. Pretty soon he will unveil what actually happened at Freddy's.CastPassable hand Josh Hutcherson leads while flanked by Matthew Lillard whose appearance is making me feel old! Other notable names include Mary Stuart Masterson and Michael P. Sullivan.VerdictI'm a hardcore gamer but I'll be honest with you I never got on the Five Nights at Freddy's train. In fact I've probably played one of the games and for a total of 10-15 minutes, I loved the idea but the execution never gripped me in fact I never really "Got" them which frustrates me.The concept however was fit for a movie but video game adaptations are historically dreadful in the vast majority of instances so any logical person will go in assuming the worst and I did. However much like the games I really wanted to like it, this to me was one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and I went in with fingers crossed.Alas I didn't expect nor want it to feel like less of a horror film and more of a strange melodrama. Now I'm not aware of the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's so I don't know how accurate it is but I really didn't like the plot so with that wrapped around the melodrama elements it made for a film that failed to get my attention.When the action kicks in it looks, adequate but the kills were lacking and there just wasn't enough of it. Also for an adaptation of the most famous jump scares video game, there weren't many scares let alone jump ones.FIve Nights at Freddy's is a heartbreaking disappointment and I hoped for so very much more.RantsI weirdly hoped that after watching this it would give me the kick up the backside to really sit down and invest some time into the games. Alas instead I fear more disappointment so think I'll lay that idea to rest. There's enough disappointment in the gaming world at the moment without me going looking for it.BreakdownLooks the part\nMatthew Lilliard is decent here\nHutcherson always looks like he's bored\nWeak kills\nPants plot\nToo much melodrama.

The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering "Can I take my kid to see this?". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The "twist" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think "Is this a horror film?". It's not "balls-to-the-wall" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.

(This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.

I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline "cheese", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.

It's a "horror" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.

I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.

I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣

Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.

The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole "kidnapped little brother" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.

I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.

That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.

Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.

Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he "still had control of them " at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.

Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving "Five Nights at Freddy's" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience.

It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!

Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.

I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.

I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more "80's slasher" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.
## 295 My Background (I think you should know my perspective). (Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, "That's just a theory...". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final "fight" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.

Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a "who done it?" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.

Traditionally, translating video games into movies is not an easy task. It requires immense love, creativity and time from someone who truly understands and respects the source material. You, as a fan of this franchise are hoping that due care was taken to craft a faithful experience worthy of your nostalgia dollars. I would love to say that's exactly what this film is, that it brings to life all those memories from your childhood with the nurturing warmth they deserve. I wish I could say this is a new horror icon. Unfortunately I can not.Far from the care necessary to produce a coherent rendition of the jump scare laden franchise, this is a film unsure of what it wants to be, what it is about or how it should get there. The writing is careless to the point of becoming disrespectful to the very nostalgia they used to draw you in. What we get is a film that is hard to justify as a Five Nights at Freddy's film devoid of any jump scares, instead manicly switching between genres and themes in some kind of existential identity crisis. It's sometimes a family drama about a child custody battle, before it switches into a sci-fi dreamscape nior about a lost brother, a gritty romance, a coming of age story and even a heist movie. Sometimes it happens to be set in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, but that is only for a third or less of the film. It does contain Freddy and his band of ghoulish friends, but they mostly just stand around like easter eggs in the background of another movie.Little in Five Nights at Freddy's makes sense, starting with its title, since lead character Mike only spends three nights in the building. The events which take place have no consequences, in the films universe as if they were in a 90s sitcom that resets after every episode. Crimes are committed, but nobody cares or remembers. Conversations are had, that are immediately forgotten. The characters have unrealistic and unconvincing conversations that betray the film's low-quality writing. Nobody does their job and it does not matter. Five Nights at Freddy's is a movie adaptation disaster lacking in even the most basic of stakes or reason for the audience to care.What about fun, you may ask. Surely, Five Nights at Freddy's compensates for its lack of coherence with some humorous and self-referential fun. Well, you are out of luck there too. The film wastes so much time switching between its multiple identities that the characters end up doing nothing but talking in disconnected monologues passed each other or sleeping for most of the film. When a horror franchise devotes more time to watching a character sleep than to anything resembling action, you know you have wasted your money.As Scott Cawthon, the creator of this franchise, I would feel outraged by the way writer/director Emma Tammi has ruined this IP. It is not hard to envision legal action coming soon, the film is just that terrible. Five Nights at Freddy's reminds us after a decade of Marvel comic film adoptions, that if you want something done properly you have to do it yourself.

The characters were moronic and unbelievable, it had nothing you want from a five nights at Freddy's movie(No mystery, intrigue, no jumpscares) and instead decided to waste its time on an annoying child and a whiney man who couldn't emote if his life depended on it.I just can't help but think this movie should have been a crime mystery movie, imagine a story where you follow a detective investigating missing children and that eventually leads him onto William aftons trail and freddy's. Something more akin to Seven than whatever the hell this trash movie was.

I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.

The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.
