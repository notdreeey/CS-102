"chaswe-28402","1 March 2018","The message of this film is that there is no symmetry to life. What goes around does not come around. The fall of the coin has no bearing on the way the cookie crumbles. There is no right or wrong to the fates of men. No justice. Opportunities seized may lead on to fortune, but they could just as well lead on to dusty death. Only children expect things to be fair. As things once were they need no longer be. Now that IMDb has decided to list reviews by date there is a slightly increased possibility that this effort will be read by someone. Performance reviews are absolutely not read by me for helpfulness, but for interest and entertainment.","

"Hitchcoc","12 January 2010","This film grabs you and doesn't let go. There is so much tension and so much pain and so much death. I can think of a more despicable villain in my movie viewing past. This is a stretch for me because I am really tired of gratuitous violence. The scenes here are so graphic and fast paced, deaths of innocents and perhaps, the deserving. I guess I should read the book for some insights. The grim reaper is around the corner and he has an air compressor not a scythe. I'm curious to see what other things Bardem has done. He is certainly a presence. Of all the scenes that will stay with me, the one at the hole in the wall gas station when the first coin is flipped is the most intense. There has been so much commentary. All I can say is it was like watching an accident; you can't take your eyes off it.","

"FLASHP01NT","9 September 2020","The meaning of Sheriff Bell's dream was that he was ashamed of himself because his fear of death prevented him from doing his duty.
In other words: Ed knew the criminal was in the motel room, but his fear of death prevented him from doing his job, which, in this case, was to die honorably in the line of duty.He interprets this moral failure as a desecration of the legacy of his father.This is contrast with the moral failure of Anton: Anton killed the woman who refused to play his coin game, which forced him to assume the moral responsibility for murdering her. This incident is immediately followed with Anton's car accident, which represents him being punished by God and forced to rely on the charity of others for survival. This is why Anton demands the kid take the money in exchange for the shirt - because he recognizes that he's being punished (i.e. he recognizes the charitable symbol and that he doesn't deserve charity) which is an indirect admission of guilt.","

"Hey_Sweden","9 February 2013","Opinions do look to be sharply divided on this typically interesting effort for the Coen brothers. Some hail it a masterpiece, others don't see the appeal at all. While this viewer doesn't quite fit into the former camp, he will say that it's one of the more unconventional examples of crime fiction that one is likely to see. It's much more of a character piece than anything, with some grisly scenes of violence here and there. Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, it centres around three characters, one being a poor hunter named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who one day stumbles into the aftermath of some drug deal gone horribly wrong. He finds $2 million on the scene and impulsively decides to keep the money for himself, while a mysterious, creepy, sadistic stranger named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) tracks him down, porting a unique pressurized air weapon. Somewhat involved is a weary Texas sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who's unsettled by what he sees as the changing times. Now, granted, what's going to test the patience of some of the viewers are some of the monologues; this isn't for people who want a straightforward story and who are turned off by philosophical musings. One can hardly fail to notice how low key most of this narrative is; even in the more intense scenes there's never really a sense of urgency. On the plus side, what we do get are some excellent character moments from the solid star trio of Brolin, Bardem, and Jones. The supporting cast is equally impressive - Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, Garret Dillahunt, Tess Harper, Barry Corbin, Stephen Root, and Beth Grant. The Coens work with some of their reliable prior collaborators such as composer Carter Burwell and cinematographer Roger Deakins. All things considered, ""No Country for Old Men"" may not be to all tastes, and does require some patience on the part of the viewer. It also doesn't resolve itself in the way one might expect for this genre, and might prove to be less than satisfactory in this regard for some of those watching. There's one fantastic confrontation near the end, but the film closes, curiously enough, after a monologue by Bell about a dream he's had. How much or how little all of this works will be up to the individual viewer. In any event, the actors are all fantastic, especially Bardem, and they make the journey worthwhile. Eight out of 10.","

"Sonic_Ocean","20 June 2013","I expect a film like 'No Country for Old Men' to be polarizing for some, especially if they're expecting a big finale with the good guy and the bad guy drawing their guns in the end to settle the score. 'No Country for Old Men' is a film that dabbles more in existentialism, despite all the crime that occurs. Basically, what I'm saying is that the film adapted from the novel is very unconventional not only for its genre, but also in its approach to storytelling. What the Coen brothers do best is combining altogether different elements and creating something with its own unique character. While there are subtle throwbacks to the old wild west, the story takes place in modern society where technology has advanced, society has advanced and unfortunately crime has too.What are Anton Chigurh's true motives? Does he have a philosophical doctrine that we the audience are unaware of or are just unable to comprehend? What Anton does is create a lot of questions that arise from his actions and his interactions with the other characters. To watch a character as odd as him is fascinating and I cannot give enough credit to Javier Bardem in portraying such a character that is so enigmatic and just his presence alone is able to evoke so much mystery. Even though Anton is very incomprehensive, it is all made up for by being able to be somehow captivated by him.How every character deals with Anton is interesting, to say the least and as the film progresses, the feeling of despondency increases gradually. The lack of heroes is what gives this film its sense of hopelessness and that feeling of hopelessness is basically set in stone from the first few shots coupled with Tommy Lee Jone's epic voice-over narration in introducing the story. It is the perfect introduction to what we will witness in the story and what it all means for a sheriff like him in comprehending these events. As the events occur, we the audience reflect on these situations just as much as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. Tommy Lee Jones' performance in this role is impressive and is injected with a great sense of humanity. I commend his portrayal as Bell, in that he is the character who carries the weight of the story.The acting is a huge fragment in bringing this film to life, but what also does that is how the visuals are executed and it is definitely utilized to a great effect. From its majestic shots to its beautiful lighting and color tones, the Coen brothers set a mood that permeates the whole film. Its barren settings really add a feeling of desolation that is at the same time hypnotic and surreal. While the film can be suspenseful and its suspense is definitely executed perfectly, the film still somehow manages to maintain an air of mystique. The non-existence of a soundtrack really gives the film a feeling of loneliness, all the while adding an even greater sense of sterility to its already barren wasteland.I can go on and on about the great acting, its memorable shots and its great script, but what makes 'No Country' a great film is that it manages to be truly idiosyncratic in its execution just like how the Coen Brothers' other great films are. Even if a film like this leaves me more questions than answers, if it still manages to captivate me to a point that I'm willing to return to it, then that shows that it doesn't matter if I don't have any answers to my questions. There are only a few films that are able to pull this off naturally and 'No Country for Old Men' is definitely one of those special films that can do just that.","

"Robert_duder","10 February 2008","People who watch these critical darlings really amuse me. They use words like ""hauntingly flawed"" or ""beautiful and haunting"" or ""stayed with me for days."" No Country For Old Men, at least the first hour and a half is main stream, well done, captivating, gory drama, thriller, action western and then the last half hour takes the film into this queer, nonsensical, blathering of artistic garbage that only someone who pretends to understand would care about. I do understand where they are trying to go with the film...the moral is...times have changed. Was that so hard to say? Instead they create an entire character, use a first class actor to portray him who does little to nothing in the entire film because artistically he's ""washed up and tired of the world."" It doesn't come across like that at all. The infamous Coen Brothers drop this interesting thriller/drama on you with this in depth creation of a serial killer who is just completely hell bent and disturbing and then they toss the entire story away on a disgustingly stupid and boring ending never giving closure to anything that they set up prior. I almost wonder if they did it on purpose as some sort of a cruel joke. I mean it feels like they got to a certain point in the film where they should have ended it but decided, 'no let's tack another 45 minutes on it but just ram whatever we come up with on to it.' As one IMDb reviewer pointed out...it feels tacked on and like a completely different movie. Josh Brolin is really terrific as country man Llewelyn Moss. As we quickly discover Moss is not as country and as stupid as he might come across. In fact he's quick witted, honest, and a fast study. He turns out to be a formidable opponent to a killer who has never had a formidable opponent. Brolin is terrific in the role. A worthy hero whose character is demeaned by its ending. Javier Bardem...well if anyone actually deserves Oscar nomination for this film it might be him. Bardem plays steely cold, brutal and ruthless killer for hire and for fun Anton Chigurh. He is a strange and interesting character who we learn and know little to nothing about. He seems to like games, and he seems to be brilliant and subversive. His straight expressions and monotoned voice make him downright disturbing. The wasted actor on the pointless character I mentioned is the amazing Tommy Lee Jones who doesn't get to be very amazing as the tired, worn out old Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. Jones is a phenomenal actor but he's almost useless in this role. He stumbles around a crime scene or two intelligently pointing out facts and then spewing wisdom about how things have changed and then doing nothing else. Very unfortunate.When it comes down to the very clever cat and mouse game between Brolin and Bardem, the film is brilliant. Bloody, and riveting and the story is starting to unfold but everything goes by the wayside. The key here is that so much of the story is unknown to us. An entire bloody battle over drugs has transpired and we know little to nothing about it. We only know this insane serial killer enters the picture and wants the money found and kept by Brolin's character.*******SPOILERALERT**********This is one time I can't help but spoil the film because I need to rant about it. The film goes down hill when, outside of the viewers sight, they cheaply kill off the main character of Llewelyn Moss, by Mexicans who also want the money. We don't see the kill...there is never any show down of any kind between Brolin's Moss and Bardem's Chigurh, and after that death the film literally just goes to pieces. However, outside of the horribly misplaced and mis-made ending, No Country For Old Men will likely impress you. It is shot in such a style that it feels like an old Western...the long, single shots and the gritty sand swept desert. Still fatal flaws make this one a poor choice by the Academy. 7/10","

"Lechuguilla","13 July 2008","While on a hunting trip, a sportsman (Josh Brolin) finds dead men and a stash of cash in the remote back country of West Texas, the result of a drug deal gone wrong. The greedy hunter takes the cash, but soon discovers that the resourceful criminal responsible for the drug deal, an outlaw named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), has a way of tracking the loot. The hunter thus finds that he is the hunted. Meanwhile, an aging Texas sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is after both the sportsman and Chigurh. The story is set in the early 1980s.To some extent, this film is a character study of Sheriff Bell, an honest lawman who is wise, observant, grounded in reality, and has a long memory. ""No Country For Old Men"" is really his story. He doesn't know quite what to make of the drug war that has crossed over from Mexico into Texas; it's something new (for the 1980s); and it makes a land that has always been hostile to settlers even more hostile and dangerous.The film's premise is quite simple, and the story is straightforward with minimal twists. A lot of time and care are taken with procedural actions: loading a gun, dressing a bloody wound, constructing a pole to retrieve a package from an air vent, for example. Dialogue is minimal; there's lots of silence.Overall casting and acting are impressive. I especially liked the performance of Tommy Lee Jones who seemed a natural choice for the role of Sheriff. Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are also well cast. Several minor roles are extremely well performed, like the store owner who is asked to call a coin toss, and the rotund lady who, with a dour face, defies Chigurh's requests in a characteristic Texas twang.The film's color cinematography is quite good; there are lots of sweeping, wide-angle outdoor shots. I really enjoyed the geographic setting, with that whistling West Texas wind, the silence, and the stunning vistas. It's a landscape that is starkly beautiful. Yet, despite its beauty and wilderness traits, it can quickly turn hostile and unforgiving for anyone unprepared for its hidden risks.""No Country For Old Men"" is a fine film. I'd describe it as a chase story -- character study combo, with elements of noir, especially in the visuals. Violence may be a tad much for some viewers. But given the subject matter, it is entirely appropriate.","

"Quinoa1984","9 November 2007","No Country for Old Men is as exceptional a mix of two creative talents- the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen, and author Cormac McCarthy (recent winner of the Pulitzer for The Road, his own masterpiece) as one could imagine, as they converge on a story that in lessor hands would be just a B movie. The story concerns an average Joe out hunting one day in Texas who comes across a bunch of dead bodies, heroin, and a satchel with 2 million in cash. He takes it, but without knowing that a true embodiment of a psychopath (Javier Bardem) is on his trail, and as he evades him it becomes more and more clear the fatalism that lies in store, as a weathered sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) is also on the trail with perpetulally sad eyes looking on from his stolid demeanor. More than this, it's also about as good a morality play as one could ask for, because it plays and tools and makes very serious questions about what is moral, or what isn't, or what is so ambiguous that it's all up to the toss of a coin or a chance ride out of town. There are a few interpretations to Bardem's character Anton that could be taken, but one thing is certain- he's less a symbol than a real presence, a ""ghost"" as Jones's sheriff calls him that can come around at the drop of a pin, usually in the dark, and strike the utmost fear (or confusion if you're a clerk) in the hearts of men and women. You'll never look at a coin toss the same way again. Or an air-gun. Or fixing a bullet wound in a leg. Or a hunt at a motel. Or even the aftermath of a car crash.But at the same time it's the purest time of cinema, recalling Hitchcock and Leone and Welles's Touch of Evil and the best of noir and westerns. There are so many exceptional shots and lighting, so much depth to the perception of the characters through the mis-en-scene, so much tension, that through this it's all up to the actors to make or break the near-perfection that is the McCarthy source. Bardem embodies Anton like no other could- you can't look at his eyes, often steel-cold and horrifically professional (to what professional who can say), which occasional tear- and it's obviously worthy of an Oscar. And Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are also fantastic; we see Brolin often in the midst of an action scene, a moment of 'save-your-life' going on, and one can finally see an actor of his caliber completely breaking out in a role that doesn't require him to ever totally ""emote"". Jones, on the other hand, gives a compassionate turn in a film that's about the struggles of desperate men in a land without law and order. He's gone through so much that it comes out completely in his voice and eyes, sorrowful but holding back, and he reaches a level of connection with the character that makes the Fugitive look like simpleton TV. Kelly McDonald, who plays Lleland's wife, is also excellent when called upon, especially in a crucial scene later in the film.It's gut-wrenching, bleak, violent, super-tense (I clenched many a knuckle during some scenes), surprisingly funny in a darkly comic manner not seen by the Coens in many years, and artistically fashioned to a beat that is meditative (watch the opening moments with Jones's voice-over), simple, and doomed. It's beautiful and terribly tragic, for McCarthy fans it finally strikes at what is truest to his material- even if you haven't read the book itself the Road will give an indication of the mood and atmosphere at hand- and at the moment I can't think of any other film that would be the best pick of the year- maybe one of the best films I've ever seen.","

"motta80-2","16 May 2007","If this doesn't end my year in the top two films of the year then we are in for one hell of an awesome year of movies.The new film from two of the best filmmakers working today No Country For Old Men shows the talents of the Coen Brothers on top form. After a couple of disappointments (Intolerable Cruelty had flashes of Coen genius but felt more of a Coen imitation than the real thing; Ladykillers had the odd funny moment but was the blandest film the brothers ever made, and there's just no excusing Marlon Wayans!) they knock this violent western drama out of the park.More in the vein of their superb early mostly-serious efforts Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing (my personal favourite of the Coen back catalogue) No Country For Old Men is a slow-moving, character-driven masterpiece about uncompromising and uncompromised characters. It is very violent and bloody and not always for the squeamish.Shot through with moments of humour these come, as in life, from real situations and observations so don't be fooled into thinking this will be the serious film with goofy-characters Coens of Fargo. No Country For Old Men is a tough, gritty story.The unrelenting pace may take its time but you are gripped every moment. This is a thriller that genuinely thrills.Javier Bardem gives the best performance of his career. And, yes, I have seen The Sea Inside and he in superb in that but here he is simply extraordinary. It is a portrayal of unrelenting evil, of true derangement, of a human being with no shreds of humanity that ranks at the very top of studied film psychopaths. And I say film not movie because this is not a clichéd character. This is not a character whose lunacy you enjoy over popcorn. This is one of the most frightening performances ever committed to celluloid. I felt truly nervous of what was going to happen every time he walked on screen.Josh Brolin essentially carries the bulk of the movie and he is excellent in a role that challenges him. I have never seen him perform to this level and if Bardem didn't steal the film you'd be talking about Brolin all the way home. As it is this gives him a showcase for his talents that should see him get a lot more attention.Tommy Lee Jones is used sparingly but to great effect. Sounding more like Michael Parks than ever before his scenes pepper the movie with a wearied view on a world he doesn't really like or understand to great effect.I did find Stephen Root a little distracting as i have never seen him in a serious role before and he just looks amusing but he is in very little.Roger Deakins' cinematography is breathtaking as usual and the Coens' script is superbly crafted. There are moments, almost asides from the main plot, that would be superfluous in most scripts and excised in most studio films but which work perfectly in the overall context of the movie as only the Coens can achieve. One scene featuring Bardem in a gas station is up there with the best scenes i have ever seen on film.I have not gone into the plot here because I saw this film having not read Cormac McCarthy novel and knowing little other than the basic log-line - a man out hunting comes upon a scene of dead bodies, guns, drugs and money on the Mexican border and comes to the attention of both those behind the scene and a local world-wearied sheriff - and i think that's the way to see this film.Go in knowing as little as you can but knowing at least this: this is a serious, violent, slow-paced character piece from the Coens. This is not a Fargo. If you are squeamish don't see it. If you have a short-attention span don't see it. If you only love the Coens for their fantastic comedies like O Brother and Big Lebowski and the comedy/thriller Fargo don't see it. But if you want to see an intelligent, superbly acted, powerful, beautiful cinematic treat that will remind you of the true power of cinema see it, see it, see it. It's a masterpiece. Bravo Ethan and Joel.","

"DonFishies","26 November 2007","Days after seeing it, I am still haunted by No Country for Old Men. There is just something so effectual and uncompromising about it, that mere words will only begin to skim the surface of the cinematic excellence on display.At its most simplistic, the film is a game of cat and mouse. The mouse here is Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who stumbles upon two million in cash after a drug deal gone wrong, and takes it thinking nothing of it. He tries to cover his tracks, but ends up letting the group looking for the money, figure out his identity. The cat is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a hit-man hired to find Moss and the money. But Chigurh is unconventional at best; he also happens to be bordering on mentally insane. And another man, a law man this time, Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), is on the trail of both men as they criss-cross around Texas.Right up until its dénouement, the film is simply brilliant. Taut and thrilling, it blows right through the majority of its two hour runtime with ease. Even during moments of slowing down, the film stays right on track and never feels like it has run its course. It engages even when it appears that nothing is happening. The Coen Brothers truly crafted what appears at first glance to be a masterpiece, even if it is their first real shot at something that is not indelibly and inarguably their own. Even without reading Cormac McCarthy's novel, I know that the Coens have done it justice, even with their bitterly twisted and dark sense of humour scattered throughout the film.But all of that comes to a standstill as the film concludes. The last twenty or so minutes feel like hours as the film wraps itself up, and it almost feels like these scenes belong to another movie entirely (one that borders on being pretentious and monotonous). I realize now that McCarthy's novel probably ends the same way, but it does not help provide closure to the fact that the movie is so break-neck paced right up until this happens. Its brilliance is shattered by what looks to be a series of tattered events thrown together to provide closure for all of the characters, alive or dead, and for its audience. It speaks volumes to the film's title, but it just does not feel satisfying compared to the rest of what we saw. Even with its enigmatic devices at play, I still cannot come to terms with how the film closes. It does haunt, and in a way, it may prove to be a significantly stronger ending as time rolls on. But as it stands now, it just feels weak.What is also a bit of a surprise, and only seems to appear as the film concludes, is the music. It is not so obvious at first, but the majority of the film is audibly shown with just the sounds the characters make and no background music to speak of. This element is brilliantly used, as it helps intensify every situation and makes the film downright terrifying in some cases. It just helps truly make the film come together, and only helps establish the quick pacing even more so. It was definitely a surprise, and one that will probably help the lasting impact of the film become even stronger.The lush and bloodsoaked visuals also help to define the film. Despite the film taking place mainly in deserted areas, or the desert itself, the camera manages to capture just the right essence of what the writing and acting is conveying. The isolation and the terror almost become characters themselves through these visuals, and are sure to be recognized as the award season rolls in.The film's acting is also very well done. Brolin anchors the film and even when it is just the audience reacting to his attempts at saving his life, he manages to deliver the best performance of his career. He breathes life into Moss, and truly brings a sense of pathos to the character. We feel for him and his greedy mistake, and as he develops into a man unwilling to go down without a fight, he only manages to up the ante for himself countlessly. Jones, as the law man stuck on the fringe of every event, also does very well for himself. Most of his work is simply delivering dialogue, but it is delivered in such a fashionable sense that you feel like he is speaking to the bigger picture of things, and not just himself. I would have liked a bit more development in his character, but what little there is helps his performance greatly.Supporting turns from Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald are also done well, but are overshadowed by the main cast by both Brolin and Jones.And even more of an overcast is Bardem as the ruthless Chigurh. He absolutely nails this character down to his very bones. If anyone is merely toying with the idea of seeing the film, it should be specifically for Bardem. His performance is calculating and plagued with petrifying silence. When he chooses to talk, his words sound like they are being given by the essence of evil. This is a man with a plan, but it is one that only belongs to him. His enigmatic presence is developed throughout the film, and never once does it feel particularly appropriate to understand where this menace comes from. Watching him on screen is a jolt to the heart, and will go down as one of the best performances of the decade. His terrible hair only helps to make his character that more scary and formidable.No Country for Old Men is one of the best pictures of the year, even if it is flawed. Its brilliance and lasting impact with leave you haunted.8.5/10.","

"poe426","6 January 2008","One of Hitchcock's tenets of good Cinema was that the filmmaker must never cheat the moviegoer; must never leave the audience wanting. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN does just that, repeatedly. While the technical aspects are topnotch all around, the telling of the story leaves more than just a little to be desired. Resolution? Yeah, right. Wonky Woody Harrelson's 'baccer-chewin' cowpoke stands out like a sore thumb in such close proximity as it is to so many so much better, and Brolin literally falls by the wayside in one of the lamest twists I do believe I've ever witnessed in a major motion pitcher. (Hitchcockian only in the PSYCHO sense, it's one of the major reasons I rate this one no higher than a six on the scale of one to ten.) Tommy Lee Jones is great, but being sidelined as he is makes his performance little more than incidental.","

"Danusha_Goska","16 December 2007","""No Country for Old Men"" is for the kind of film fan who remarks, ""Gee, wasn't that murder a clever mise-en-scene?"" and who asks, ""What kind of lens do you think they used in that strangulation shot?"" The skeleton of ""No Country for Old Men"" is a cheap, 78-minute, gun-monster-chase B movie. Javier Bardem plays Anton Chigurh, the monster. He is Frankenstein; he is Max Cady from ""Cape Fear;"" he is from your childhood nightmares. He may be death personified.One of many completely implausible scenes: an arresting officer, defying any logic, turns his back on Chigurh. Chigurh, displaying the supple sinuosity of a Cirque du Soleil contortionist, or an orangutan, slips out of his handcuffs. This is done out of camera view, because for Bardem it would be impossible; thus the scene's implausibility. Chigurh then, in real time, strangles the young police officer to death on camera. This is an extended sequence. This is the payoff for ""No Country for Old Men"": watching one human being kill other human beings, in scene after scene after scene, using various weapons, including a captive bolt pistol usually used on livestock. Guess Chigurh couldn't get hold of a Texas chainsaw. This is a slasher flick for the pretentious.Early on, there are well-done, if standard, chase scenes. A man outruns a car: not believable, but fun to watch. A pit bull chases this fleeing man down a whitewater river. The man reloads his gun at the very last moment (of course) and shoots the pit bull dead just as it is about to sink its teeth into the man. Later, in a hotel, a beeping transponder informs the killer where his prey hides. Your pulse may race and you may think that this is all leading up to something interesting. You will be disappointed.Tommy Lee Jones, whose ear lobes appear to be metastasizing as he ages, wanders aimlessly through the film as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, delivering cornpone, homespun, cowboy poet ruminations that are more or less opaque in meaning. No doubt the film's fans are even now feverishly compiling a companion volume that decodes Bell's dreams and conveys their depth.Woody Harrelson, late the bartender of the TV sitcom ""Cheers,"" shows up for a completely pointless half-hour role that yanks the viewer right out of the movie. ""What is Woody Harrelson doing here?"" Some years back, some bored English majors decided that conventional narrative structure was not intellectual enuf, and decided to play games with narrative. ""No Country for Old Men"" plays these sorts of games. The viewer is invited to invest time getting to know characters who are eliminated from the plot in ways that convey no meaning and are not moving. The narrative flow is truncated and yet the movie keeps going; viewers ask themselves why the movie is continuing -- sometimes out loud, even in a movie theater -- this is supposed to be a deep, intellectual experience. It is not. It is merely annoying.Other than bratty English major head games, pretty much the entire substance of ""No Country for Old Men"" is a series of murders and tortures committed by Chigurh, who may symbolize your high school's worst bully  a bully so terrifying exactly because he targeted English majors. His victims are often courteous; their likability makes watching them be humiliated and then murdered an uncomfortable, and, given the film's structure, ultimately pointless exercise. Not only are the Coen Brothers torturing their characters, they also torment their ticket-buying audiences.Chigurh's nice victims are often poor, rural, Southern, whites, the kind of people often not featured as positive, lead characters in Hollywood entertainments. They are often villains  witness films like ""Deliverance."" Here they are murder victims. Chigurh is associated with Mexicans, part of a rising ""dismal tide,"" as one Anglo character puts it. No matter how you feel about immigration, you may find this association of Mexicans with a rising tide of evil to be offensive.The film's boosters insist that the movie offers three deep and shocking lessons: life doesn't always follow a neat narrative structure; evil often triumphs; and the old days were more peaceful and, nowadays, things are getting really bad. In truth, everyone walking in to the theater already knows the first two ""lessons."" No one needs the Coen brothers to inform him that life doesn't always follow a neat narrative structure, or that evil often triumphs. We expect filmmakers, and all artists, to offer us a more substantial thesis. As for the third ""lesson,"" that the old days were more peaceful and things are getting really bad today -- have the Coens, or Cormac McCarthy, heard of Attila the Hun, or any number of other less-than-peaceful and courteous personages from our common human past? One might well be dubious about ""No Country""'s ""lessons."" Visit internet discussion boards devoted to this movie, and you will find fans asking, not ""What is fate?"" or ""What is the role of a good man in a bad world?"" but questions like, ""If Hannibal Lector and Anton Chigurh were locked in a room, who would come out alive?"" Given such reflections, one is safe in concluding that the appeal of this film is its emphasis on graphic violence, rather than on any more advanced intellectual or artistic merit.","

"howardeisman","25 December 2007","This was an exciting chase/suspense/character movie until about the half way mark. At that point, too much was going on, all of it similar and all of it almost beyond comprehension. There seemed to an endless supply of Mexican drug runners be to killed. Where they came from, with whom they were affiliated, what they were trying to do, were all insufficiently explicated-if at all. The end of the movie is, IMHO, just a disintegration-as if all the money or film stock ran out. Some attempt is made to present the point that this film is an existential exercise showing what I would call nickle and dime existentialism.Yeah, yeah, we're all going to die. evil exists, life is a coin toss. This philosophizing didn't help.","

"littlemartinarocena","4 March 2008","I don't remember being so scared in a movie theater since ""Don't Look Now"" Here the Coen Brothers take everything a step further with exhilarating ease. The terror was genuine and not because we were rooting for Josh Brolin or anybody in particular. The terror was personal, Joel and Ethan Coen made that terror visceral and tangible. It has to do with our own nightmares. Josh Brolin was a perfect piece of casting because in a way he doesn't have many personal colors. He's one of the bunch, one of us and we could put ourselves in his shoes. That is the art of film narrative expressed in a way that we've never experienced before. I heard people old enough to have seen Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" in the theaters and what glued them to the screen was their own fear. Well, that's what I've experienced here. Javier Bardem is superb, considering that he's the reason for the fear. He carries a human/inhuman kind of strength and we know he'll get us, sooner or later and if we consider the ending of the film, he might still do. Worthy Oscar winners, all of it and all of them.","

"majikstl","29 February 2008","When some movies are over, everything is tied up in a neat little package; for better or worse, someone worked really hard to make sure there were no unanswered questions. Other movies aren't so considerate. Others may be messy, but the good ones leave you asking key questions about the philosophy of the story. They may make you wonder ""What would I do in that situation?"" ""Was the hero really a hero?"" ""Do I agree with the film's moral?"" etc. These films draw you into the story, to the point where the ending is really the beginning of the film's lasting power. Sometimes messy is good.Bad ones, however, leave you questioning the story itself: ""Why did he do that?"" ""What happened to so-and-so?"" ""Did that make any sense?"" ""What did I miss?"" Such films make you see the holes in the plot, not the story that surrounds them. When the film is a huge critical or commercial success, the pertinent question may well be ""So, what's the big deal?"" NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a ""so-what's-the-big-deal"" type of movie. It is undoubtedly THE film of 2007, an Oscar-winning, critic's choice, top ten darling. Yet, for the most part, it is an utterly conventional modern day western; so predictable that Charles Bronson could be resurrected from the grave and plopped down into the middle of it without missing a beat. It is adequately directed and decently acted, but otherwise -- for the first two-thirds -- it is largely without distinction. Perhaps, because the filmmakers work so hard to seem unconventional in the last third, the defenders think they see something unique in the whole.The set up is routinely plotted: A poor, but relatively honest young man, while hunting in the west Texas desert, stumbles on a drug deal gone bad. While callously rooting around amidst the dead bodies, he helps himself to over two million dollars in illicit cash. He takes off and is soon pursued by a relentless, but relatively insane mob assassin -- and they are both -- sorta -- pursued by an honest, but relatively ineffectual local marshal. Leaving a predictable trail of dead bodies along the way, the film seems to be promising a confrontation where any two or more of the protagonists should face each other in a traditional showdown.At least, that is how the writing/directing team of Joel and Ethan Coen set things up. It could be argued that Coen brothers are playing around with the audience, mischievously creating expectations that they have no intentions of meeting. But in side-stepping the obvious tried and true plot twists and dramatic confrontations that such a climax normally would offer, the Coens don't really replace them with anything better. The last third of NO COUNTRY is shocking and challenging only because it is so vapid and devoid of drama. Characters die off-camera with only the vaguest explanation, while other characters' fates are left an obtuse mystery. The finale peters out into three separate and pointless conclusions: the thief dies, the killer apparently gets away and the policeman quits, never to cross each other's paths. And the audience isn't given much reason to care about any of them.The anemic narrative wouldn't matter so much, I suppose, if the film were instead a incisive or compelling study of one or more of the characters. Though the actors give decent enough performances, they can't flesh out the characters beyond ciphers. Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss, the hunter turned thief, is a solid presence, a modern day twist on the iconic figure of the strong, silent and resourceful cowboy. But beyond the good-boy-gone-bad tradition of the western, the film gives Llewelyn little backstory and no particular depth beyond being both foolish and yet smarter than one would expect. Ed Tom Bell, the gruff, world-weary, retirement-bound, small-town sheriff, is played by Tommy Lee Jones as a safe and comfortable stereotype; only denied by the uninspired script either the traditional age-cultivated wisdom or the opportunity to be even vaguely heroic. He spends most of the film wistfully longing for the good old days.Javier Bardem's much praised work as the tiresomely inscrutable and indestructible hit-man Anton Chigurh is largely a one-note performance -- Oscar win notwithstanding. His persistence, in lieu of any personality, has been inexplicable interpreted as having mythic dimensions as the embodiment of cruel fate or death incarnate. Only desperation to find meaning in the slight story justifies such heavy-handed symbolism. Lumbering through the film with all the emotional complexity of a slasher movie serial killer, Chigurh is little more than a lazy gimmick; with his over-sized weapons (one requires he lug around a 30-pound tank of compressed air!) and arbitrary flip-a-coin sadism, he is a ludicrous character who survives only due to the manipulations of a generously contrived script.But, it is no wonder the film focuses on Chigurh, who like Coens' films, embodies a cold, dispassionate emptiness. It is not that they don't do compassion (let alone passion) well, they don't even try. In their best effort, BLOOD SIMPLE, the chill of their drama is counteracted with a coy air of satire. Even FARGO is unpleasantly empty as far as emotional depth. You can tell a lot about filmmakers by how they treat even their minor and incidental characters; most characters in Coen films are disposable plot devices. It is no wonder a key character is killed off screen; the Coens don't care about his fate and assume we shouldn't either.NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN builds to one of the least satisfying conclusions of all time. The film is ultimately riddled with gaps in logic and figure-it-out-for-yourself ambiguities; things that the audience may not need to see, but have a right to expect to experience as part of the drama. NO COUNTRY isn't just weak film-making, it is an act of bad faith. The final question facing the viewer might well be ""Is that it?""","

"Craig_McPherson","17 November 2007","There's very little ""good"" in No Country for Old Men beyond the mesmerizing acting and viciously dark screenplay. Instead, the unholy trinity of temptation, cynicism and pure, dark, evil take center stage in this modern western directed by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen.Based on the 2003 novel by Cormac McCarthy, the movie unfolds in the dusty Texas borderlands as hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the remnants of a desert drug deal gone bad, complete with a case containing two million dollars. Succumbing to temptation, Moss makes off with the money setting in motion a chain of events that leaves a trail of blood spattered carnage across the State as he is pursued by the ruthless, coin tossing hit man Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) among whose killing weapons of choice is a pneumatic air gun.Bearing little in common with pretty much any previous Coen film with the possible exception of Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men is a dark, bleak, ode to the baser elements of the human soul, and a spit in the eye to the noble ones as well.With a structural trademark hinging upon breaking the conventional norms of predictability, No Country is a movie that will unsettle you at successive turns - in the way deaths are dealt out; by its palpable tension that can almost be cut with a knife, and its periodic deviations from the narrative norm  the latter likely the only Coen brothers ""quirk"" for which their movies are renown.Switching back and forth between the game of cat and mouse being played out by Moss and Chigurh and the investigation of unfolding events by cynical aging Texas Sheriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), the Coens weave a web of dangled threads that one can't help but expect will be neatly tied together at story's end, only to tie them up in ways that buck the storytelling norm and manage to be both unsatisfying and true to their nature at the same time.Unforgettable among this tableau is Bardem's Chigurh. The Spanish actor who has also appeared in Love in the Time of Cholera and Goya's Ghosts evokes the most amazing presence of a ruthless killer with his own twisted adherence to a bizarre code of ethics that nothing short of witnessing his performance can do it justice.Sadly, however, justice is one of the few items in abundance in this movie. And yet, as unhappy as I am that the Coen's screenplay defiantly refuses to cater to the audience's inherent desire for satisfaction, I grudgingly have to admire them for opting for the unpredictable.Consider the movie akin to one big coin toss  will it be heads or tales? Call it - you've been calling it your entire life.","

"ProfRevDrFilmReligionHistory","20 April 2017","No Country for Old Men won four Academy Awards in 2007, including Best Picture and Best Director(s). Despite the critical acclaim, the Coen Brother's adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel was probably a bit of a head-scratcher to many people.The film's narrative begins in familiar fashion, introducing you to the main characters and setting up the plot using recognized, established filmic devices. Llewelyn Moss stumbles upon a suitcase filled with cash and wants to keep it for himself. Anton Chigurh is the sociopath who will stop at nothing to get the cash back. Ed Bell is the Sheriff tasked with bringing Chigurh to justice and, it is presumed, keeping Moss and his wife, Carla Jean, from danger. In addition, there's a corporate backer, a hired gun, and a Mexican gang who are also after the cash (i.e., the McGuffin). So much for the usual narrative elements.When the film continues far beyond the point that the expected narrative structure breaks down, viewers are left to grasp at what the film is actually about. What, if anything, is this film trying to say?I propose that the film is, among other things, a meditation on the impotence of human and divine systems of justice in light of unflinching, unrelenting, random, radical evil. There are a number of elements in the film that indicate such a meditation, but one need not look much further than the meditations of Sheriff Bell, whose words begin and end the film. Consider:""There was this boy I sent to the 'lectric chair at Huntsville Hill here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killt a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn't any passion to it. Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he'd do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. 'Be there in about fifteen minutes'. I don't know what to make of that. I sure don't. The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure."" With these words, the film's ""story line"" unfolds, with Sheriff Bell trying, and failing, to be effective.At the end of the film, the retired Sheriff Bell describes a dream to his wife:""It was like {my father and I} was both back in older times and I was on horseback going' through the mountains of a night. Going' through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on going'. Never said nothing' going' by. He just rode on past... and he had his blanket wrapped around him and his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin' fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. 'Bout the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was going' on ahead and he was fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold, and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up."" The film is nihilistic in both structure and content. If you would like to force a less despairing ending, Bell's dream could be interpreted as a ray of hope: a light shines in the darkness! On the other hand, it is a dream that he wakes up from.I don't know what to make of that. I sure don't. But that doesn't mean I can't try.","

"fwomp","3 January 2008","If you're a Coen brothers fan, you're gonna be extremely delighted with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. This is Ethan and Joel at the pinnacle of their directing careers, something that should not be missed by anyone interested in film or entertainment. Forget FARGO. Push aside THE BIG LEBOWSKI. Move over O' BROTHER WHERE ART THOU. No Country is leaps and bounds beyond those. In fact, it reigns supreme as 2007's best film.I don't always agree with movie critics but this time they got it right. It is the first time that Associated Press reviewers David Germain and Christy Lemire have both selected the same film as their #1 pick. With more award nominations than you could shake a stick at (including four Golden Globes, three Screen Actors Guilds, probably a gaggle of Oscars and many, many, many others), No Country will undeniably have directors, actors and screenwriters jumping up on stage come awards ceremony time.Equal parts thriller, western, crime-drama, and action, No Country weaves a tapestry of excellence throughout its length.The first note of excellence must be directed at Spanish actor Javier Bardem. Probably not very well known to most American audiences, Javier has cemented himself as the leader in portraying a psychopathic killer and (dare I say it!) has surpassed that of Anthony Hopkins in his SILENCE OF THE LAMBS Hannibal Lecter role (something that I thought would never happen). Ruthless, unforgiving, sociopathic, and in desperate need of a new hair style, Anton Chigurh (Bardem) is flawless. Every time he showed up on-screen I felt a chill run through my bones (""Call it""). Absolutely perfect.The next note of excellence must go to Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. Llewelyn Moss (Brolin, PLANET TERROR) is the lucky/unlucky soft-spoken Texas cowpoke/hunter who stumbles across a veritable fortune in drug money only to be relentlessly pursued by killer Anton. Mr. Moss' gradual decline in health (mainly due to wounds inflicted on him by Anton) is painful to watch up until the very end. Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is the opposite of Anton Chigurh. He doesn't understand all of the death and destruction laid at his feet. He longs for a time when murders were easy to track and solve, not these new-fangled deaths where bullets aren't used (air-guns do just fine) and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to their patterns.The fourth (perhaps this should've been first) note of excellence goes to the Coen brothers for their perfect adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel by the same name. Many lines of dialogue were lifted verbatim from the novel itself, including the ending monologue by Tommy Lee. It's noteworthy to mention here that the Coen brothers not only directed but wrote the screenplay, too.The final note has to go Cinematographer Roger Deakins (he's worked with the Coen brothers on many occasions and also did the exemplary JARHEAD work). Every scene was so well thought-out and so convincingly filmed that viewers are carried freakishly easy through this incredible story.It's difficult to do justice to this film with one short review, simply because there are so many great elements to it. The casting was spectacular  with Woody Harrelson (NORTH COUNTRY) and Kelly Macdonald (THE GIRL IN THE CAFÉ) pulling in exceptional supporting roles  as was Carter Burwell's haunting original musical score and Mary Zophres impeccable costume designs.If you missed this film at your local cineplex, you may have gypped yourself from experiencing this amazing cinematic event. Now you've gotta wait for the DVD to be released and then ...it's your call.","

"wisewebwoman","26 January 2008","Not to mention bloated dead bodies of dogs and humans and a ""man who wouldn't die"".""No Country for Old Men"" has Javier Bardem playing Anton Chigurh, a monstrous motive-less killer (unless you count the money, but how does he know about it?) He slides in and out of scenes, you are always chilled but like the clichéd train-wreck victims you see reeling on the side of the road, he never engages you, you never speculate on what made him this way, he is simply a nerveless, passionless cypher.Actually the clichés were too many to count in this truly, truly disappointing effort from the Coen brothers. A police officer turns his back on the monster and is promptly dispatched and of course the monster manages to squeeze bloodily out of his own handcuffs. H'mm. The instrument used to kill by Chigurh is some kind of stun gun with an oxygen tank. Surely to God he could get hands on a gun with a silencer and not have to lug this tank around like some deranged Fred Munster? There is so much blood, the only conclusion I could make was that this was the whole point, raise the barf meter with everyone, show acres of gratuitous violence to draw in the desirable adbash demographic and forget any kind of plot. A slasher film for the pseudo-sophisticated.The movie grabs you early and you think, as you survey a field full of fallen felons (they were involved in a drug heist) discovered by an officer played by Josh Brolin, that this movie is going to unwind a great mystery. You settle in for the denouement.Poor you. You are sidetracked by an absolutely meaningless sub-plot involving Woody Harrelson (another grisly ending) and by Tommy Lee Jones who was left without any relevant script and wanders cynically in and out of scenes, delivering tired old witticisms as a sheriff. We can count the ways and days of tired old cynical sheriffs. I was waiting for ""life is just a box of chocolates and Chigurh the hardboiled candy"". It would have improved things.I was baffled as to the narrative. Was there one? Why didn't I get it? Was this movie, in spite of the barrels of blood, too deep for me? I was asking myself these questions long before it was over.Was this movie reaching for pretension or was it truly in the stratum of the intellectual elite? Coin toss answer.For me, it seemed fitting that there was no ending to this. No plot should equal a no ending. The beast didn't die and went on his stumbling way. All the good guys died, apart from aforementioned slow-drawl sheriff, who is now retired.Zero artistic merit, zero plot. I gave it a 1 to bring down the over-rating. I still like Tommy, Josh gave a great perforance but I'm going to be really leery of future Coen efforts.","

"Navaros","11 March 2008","No Country for Old Men is a very bad movie that is chockful of basic structural errors of storytelling & film-making, and common sense. But, hold on a minute. What I just said might be all wrong! An outmoded way of thinking. A viewpoint that simply does not have enough ""intelligence"" to appreciate the deep brilliant art that *is* ""No Country"".It seems that these days if you make a movie that has no story, no point, and no ending --- that that is automatically a *masterpiece* that is worthy of universal critical and consumer acclaim, and a Best Picture Oscar. That in a nutshell, is *exactly* what No Country for Old Men is.Now that ""No Country"" has paved the way for such ""brilliant innovations"", I can't wait to see what other ""innovations"" await films to come in the future. Maybe next in addition to masterpiece movies requiring there to be no story, no point, and no ending, they will also eventually further innovate by doing away with other things like actors and dialogue. Maybe mankind will eventually *evolve* to such a point of perfect enlightenment that films consisting entirely of slideshows of some kindergarten students' fingerpainting artwork will eventually be the recipient of Best Picture Oscar awards and universal acclaim.""No Country"" has taken a lot of flack for having a ""controversial ending"" --- but that is inaccurate phrasing. ""No Country "" has *no ending* at all. For it to have a ""controversial ending"" carries the prerequisite that it first *has* an ending. It doesn't! ""No Country"" is just a bunch of random scenes of a repressed homosexual, turned psychopath, who goes around shooting people with a weapon powered by a giant tank of compressed air. This random formula is even further randomized by not *bothering* to show many of his kills on-screen. Including the death of the main character, who is suddenly, inexplicably, shown as a corpse in the middle of the movie. Even though the movie had previously spent gratuitous amounts of screen-time showing him prepare for, evade, and engage in firefights with the psychopath. Yet no *zero* time is devoted to showing how he died. The randomness of showing trivial moments like the main character staring thoughtfully at a wall, and buying tent-poles from a camping store, are crafted with meticulous detail and given tons of screen-time. But the film's utter genius shines through *most of all* by not spending one second showing him die or struggle to survive in his final moments before he died. Just a random fade-in, and he's suddenly a corpse! The sheer *brilliance* of such artistic unconventional storytelling has never been seen in any film or book *ever* made before in the *history* of mankind. I wonder why? Why did it take until the year 2007 for man to finally reach this high watermark of storytelling utopia? Ah heck, I need to stop wondering, and be content to wallow in the fact that since I ""don't get it"", I'm simply an idiot.The main character is an extremely banal hick so I had no emotional reaction whatsoever to him at any point in the movie, or to him magically fading-in as a corpse, but I'm sure the lack of any reason to care one iota about the main character is yet another of this film's amazing innovations. Layers upon layers, my friend! In several other cases, the movie makes it totally unclear if the psychopath killed his victim or not, because after trapping the victim, the scenes simply fades to black and then he is shown again outside the building later and the victims' fates are never revealed; they are never seen or mentioned in the movie again, as corpses or otherwise. One cannot assume he killed them, because in an early scene he spares a gas station attendant.""No Country"" also innovates the art of film-making by making it's psychopath killer, ""the deepest film villain since Hannibal Lecter"" (or, the universal acclaimists allege...and who wants to argue with *them*!). No Country's killer shows his compelling deepness by repeatedly shouting things like ""CALL IT!"" after he flips a coin. In another scene, he further shows his deepness by making such deeply thought-provoking statements as: ""I won't tell you you can save yourself. You can't."" *Clearly*, this is Pulitzer Prize-worthy dialogue and one of the great cinematic villains of all-time. Thanks, universal acclaimists, for being honest about this and giving this character all the credit he so richly deserves! Maybe in the sequel he can play Blackjack or Poker to determine if he will shoot someone with his airgun or not? There I go again with my bad ideas, he's *already* *soooooooo freakin' unbelievably complex!!!* that to add a further level of complexity to him, like Blackjack-playing on top of coin-flipping, would be too much to even *try *to comprehend without bursting a gasket in one's brain wiring.Tommy Lee Jones plays a hick sheriff in this movie. He is a great actor, but he seems very bored in this role and it's like he's phoning in his performance. Perhaps he was disappointed when he read the script and realized the movie has no ending, and this made him not wanna put any energy or effort into the role. The other actors in No Country are all third-rate unknowns (other than Woody Harrelson who has a nonsensical, pointless cameo); maybe Tommy Lee was simply trying to dumb-down his acting down to their level. Whatever the case may be, it's definitely Tommy Lee Jones' worst performance ever. On second thought, I am probably wrong with everything I've just said in this paragraph. Really, Tommy Lee Jones' seemingly uninspired performance is probably just him tapping into the higher plane of existence upon which this whole enigmatic masterpiece of a movie so-good that normal human beings are barely fit to watch it, much less understand it, occupies.","

"phenomynouss","2 March 2008","I was not biased against the film when I saw it. I loved ""The Big Lebowski"", and was even amused by the similar theme in the two: both involve a suitcase full of money which the main character carts around, for events to get the suitcase lost, and inevitably leave the audience in the dark as to the eventual fate of the money.Unfortunately, as great as the movie started out, it devolved into pretentious art-film-like movie-making and a muddled ending with no clear ending. Not defined ending or happy ending, but CLEAR ending. The whole thing came to an abrupt end like a train that hits an invisible wall at low speed.The cinematography was something worth an Oscar in itself, and I especially loved the way it was shot when Llewellyn discovered the botched drug deal and eventually the money. It was so realistic, you could almost feel the mucky grime of blood drying in the sand or the greasiness of an overused dump-truck, the plainness of the brand-less milk, all the homey settings of a western border-city.The character Llewellyn isn't very likable. He reminds me something of The Dude in that he's very much aloof to the horrors of seeing the shot-up drug dealers, and casually takes their money and goes home, suddenly remembering one of the dying men asked him for water, and deciding to go back with a gallon of tap water for him, until Anton Shigurh comes after him and he panics, and is forced to become resolute.In the beginning, Anton Shigurh, played by Javier Bardem, seemed the ideal villain; quiet, utterly irredeemable, seeming the kind of person who would kill someone at any moment without any sort of honor. Even the scene where he makes a shopkeep gamble on his life with the flip of his coin, you fully expect Anton to kill him at any moment, even when he lets the man live.At about the mid-way point of the movie, it starts to unravel. Perhaps I need to see the movie again, but for the life of me, I cannot begin to wonder what Tommy Lee Jones's character's purpose in the movie is. He promises Llewellyn's wife that he'll make sure Llewellyn lives, and goes about doing nothing but reading the newspaper and lounging about in the office or at a diner. Only once does he visit the crime scene, and towards the end does he come close to the killer.Next come the nameless character played by Woody Harrelson, and the oh-so-elegantly named ""Man in the Office"" played by Stephen Root. Woody Harrelson's character describes Anton for us, and then wanders off to meet with Llewellyn, and then get killed by Anton for some reason. Anton then randomly appears in the Office man's office and kills him in the middle of interviewing some guy for a job. Anton doesn't say anything of worth to the other man, and is then back to the western area chasing Llewellyn. I have no idea what that was supposed to be about.The thing is a mess, as the movie skips ahead slightly with Llewellyn dead, and Anton flustered that he lost the money. In a moment that completely changes my opinion of Anton from cold, calculating, assassin of pure evil, to a pitiful, pathetic, stubborn childish creature that kills Llewellyn's wife just because Llewellyn didn't let Anton kill him.For some random reason, as Anton is driving off from her house, he gets hit by a car, staggers out with a broken arm, and walks away.For another random reason, Tommy Lee Jones's character has some retrospect, then gives a long, rambling soliloquy about a dream he had. I have heard many accents, and I have very sharp hearing. I can understand some of the most rambling of mumblings and mutterings, but for the life of me, I could not understand more than a few words of Tommy Lee Jones's heavily accented, mumbling, rambling speech about dreaming about his father.And it suddenly ended with ""And then I woke up.""","

Soon a psychotic killer (Javier Bardem) is after him while a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to figure out what's going on. I'll start off by saying that I'm not a big fan of the Coen brothers. With that out of the way, this is certainly the best movie I've seen from them but it goes downhill very quickly in the final thirty-minutes, which are quite horrid to be honest. However, everything before that is masterfully done with a beautiful craft that makes this familiar story come off very original, dark and at times funny. I really enjoyed the slow pace that the film carries but I'm not sure if that's how I should describe it. The movie has plenty of graphic violence and action and what makes it so shocking is that it usually comes out of no where or happens when you don't expect it. The pace of the film is slow but this helps when the violence breaks out. The performances are all terrific with Bardem stealing the show as the psychotic killer. Whenever he's on screen you can't take your eyes off of him and his silent performance speaks more than any words could. I was also very impressed with Brolin who I'm usually hit and miss on. Woody Harrelson has a few nice scenes and Tommy Lee Jones is the old Tommy Lee Jones we all love. The film was a lot of fun until the conclusion, which I thought was quite awful.","

However it is a great movie, I'd go as far to say it is my definition of a flawed masterpiece(the only other movie I've given that definition to is The Magnificent Ambersons). So why do I call it a flawed masterpiece rather than a masterpiece full stop? Well actually right up to the last twenty minutes, the film was the latter rather than the former. If the last twenty minutes had not felt like a completely different movie, it would've stayed like that. As is the case with all the Coen Brothers' movies, No Country for Old Men is very well made with impressive cinematography, editing and settings. The story is compelling, the direction superb and the script most of the time taut, funny, thrilling and exciting. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are excellent in this film, but if I have to give an award to best performance of the film, it would be Javier Bardem in a villainous role that is menacing and chillingly effective. Overall, a great movie but due to the final twenty minutes it just loses out to that extra something. 9/10 Bethany Cox","

"DUKEJBM","16 November 2007","I'm sorry but anyone that thinks this movie is clever or deep is certifiably insane.I've literally seen thousands of films at the theatre in my life and the response to this thing was something I've never seen before. It was a near revolt. I actually saw people angrily walking to get a refund. This exchange perfectly sums up this waste of film...The woman seated behind me turns to the people she was with and says, ""Bill, that was the LAST time you pick the movie."" He responds, ""I'm soooo sorry. That was completely awful."" I turned to my friends and apologized as well. They were there because I wanted to see it. I had to apologize all the way to the parking lot.Anyone here labeling it a masterpiece or thinking it's a textured, complex film couldn't be more wrong. This was nothing more then a blatant attempt to shatter the cookie cutter Hollywood genre picture using poor dialogue and offbeat characters. That was its ONLY goal. Creating unpredictable crap may have helped it accomplish that goal but that doesn't make it good work in any way. It certainly doesn't qualify as entertainment.SPOILERS follow but I'd advise those who haven't seen it to read them. This could save you money and wasted time...Killing the lead barely three quarters of the way through the movie, OFF SCREEN, may seem clever to some but it's just so irritating to most. The movie does take the tedious time to try to emotionally involve you with the characters and the story. What I can't understand is how anyone can think that frustrating an audience is good cinema. Callously killing multiple characters with no consequences, killing the lead off screen, killing his wife, having the insane psychopath villain walk away scott free (hurt by a random car wreck no less) and having Tommy Lee Jones' character quit and babble to the camera before a cut to black is as bad of a theatre experience as anyone could imagine. Clearly, my audience felt cheated and I was chief among them. Word of mouth will be as bad as gets from general audiences, not alleged film buffs pretending to posture and enjoy a film because they think it makes them appear clever.","

"ccthemovieman-1","13 March 2008","I really enjoyed this film on the first viewing and every one since.It reminded me of the Coen Brothers' first film, ""Blood Simple"" (1984). with its understated but quirky and violent characters, odd dialog and sudden brutality. It's an odd crime film, but that what's the Coen Brothers usually deliver us: odd and entertaining movies. Whether it's the ""Best Picture Of The Year,"" I question, but I did find it fascinating. Many times the villain is the most interesting character in a movie, and I'd have to say that's the case here, too. Javier Bardem, a Spanish actor, plays ""Anton Chigurh"" and this guy is one strange dude, with an even-stranger weapon. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are almost as intriguing. Brolin is ""Llewelyn Moss,"" a guy out hunting one day and finds dirty money at a bloody crime scene, takes it, and is on the run from the crooks who own it. Jones is the local sheriff, ""Ed Tom Bell,"" who actually tries to help Moss by grabbing him before the killers do. Ed Tom admits times sure have changed and deranged killers like ""Anton"" are totally unexplainable. To me, Jones is always a great actor to watch.The supporting actors in here are all good, too, and also quirky....just like the Coens like them (see ""Fargo"" for a good example).Another star of this film is cinematographer Roger Deakins, one of the best - if not the best - in the business. Deakins was up for two Academy Awards this year: this movie and ""The Assassination of Jesee James By The Coward Robert Ford."" That's how good a photographer Deakins is, nominated for two films.To me, though, the highlight of this film was the dialog. Man, there were some strange sentences uttered in here with some odd grammar and expressions thrown in. Early on, I put on the English subtitles so I wouldn't miss any of it, or misinterpret what everyone said. In other words, this was not only a fun movie to watch, but to hear. It was very suspenseful most of the way as this turns out to be a long cat-and-mouse chase story. That's usually entertaining to watch, and this is no exception.Are there flaws in here? Sure, a couple beauties, too, but nothing unusual for Hollywood. Shootouts in the street and a major car crash - all in city and residential areas - and nobody comes out to see what happened? Also, what happened to ""Moss"" is a big issue. Maybe I missed that. Finally, the abrupt anti-climactic ending is a biggest issue, one I know displeased a lot of viewers.....but I don't find any movie or story as perfect. I'm willing to forgive the Coens for these transgressions, because, overall, this is so entertaining.Nonetheless, it's nice to finally see a ""Best Picture"" movie that wasn't totally disappointing.","

"moutonbear25","17 November 2007","Llewelyn Moss: Can't help but compare yourself to the ol' timers. Can't help but wonder how'd they do in these times.The Coen brothers have been making movies for over 20 years now. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is their twelfth feature together. While they were once considered princely collaborators held at the highest esteem by film enthusiasts the world over, they have recently been the victims of their own identity crisis. Caught between their signature exploration of all things quirky and abnormal found in the parts of America thought to be forgotten and the demanding pressures of delivering bankable Hollywood fare, the Coen's finished by delivering sub-par work that tarnished their lustrous reputation. The film enthusiasts thought they might have lost great talents to Hollywood while Hollywood wasn't even sure they wanted them. What were these ""aging"" filmmakers to do? They could have polished off another Tom Hanks picture and crossed their fingers. They could have appealed to their fans and told another tale of the idiosyncrasies of those living in the middle of nowhere. They could have tried appeasing both parties by attempting THE BIG LEBOWSKI 2. Instead, they did none of these things. No, instead, the Coen brothers crafted a film that is unlike any film they have ever made and is also perhaps the best film they've ever made.Translating Cormac McCarthy's novel about the relationship between the hunter and the hunted to the screen may be smoothest decision these boys have made for years. Not only does it allow for the brothers to explore the grim sides of characters consumed by money and an unnerving peace derived from killing, but NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN also leaves the door open for an interpretive commentary on the Coen's career itself. Allow me to explain by painting a picture from the film. Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) aims his rifle at an unsuspecting animal grazing alongside the herd. He is right now in charge, in control, the hunter. He fires and misses, thus beginning his steady descent into ruin. He moves toward the spot where his prey once stood only to find the site of a drug deal massacre. Here, he innocently stumbles upon an enormous amount of money. He picks it up and goes without realizing the hell that is about to be brought upon him. He inadvertently becomes the hunted. He spends the remainder of the film calculating and executing different attempts to regain the superior position he once held. The comparisons are subtle and come about naturally rather than existing as the initial basis for the film to grow out of, reinforcing their genuine nature. I could explain my logic behind this analogy but that would be very un-Coen like.Another consistency throughout the Coen Brothers' careers is the elevated caliber of talent they attract to their diverse projects. With their writing at top of its game, performances by Brolin, Javier Bardem and Tommy Lee Jones are pushed to the heights of their potential. Moss is a quiet man, focused and constantly thinking about what his next play will be. He has no time for ego, only function, and though most of his motivation is to avoid drawing attention to himself, Brolin's interpretation cannot help but capture our notice. For the second time this year (in conjunction with his slimy crooked cop turn in American GANGSTER), Brolin reinvigorates his skills by inhabiting Moss fully as an instinctual and reactionary being. While Jones is also impressive as a police officer resigned to following the action without any possibility of curbing the outcome, it is Bardem's performance as Anton Chigurh that will leave audiences with a haunting chill after experiencing it. His portrayal of a psychopathic hunter is both disturbing and riveting. This is a man who enjoys torturing his victims mentally by asking them questions meant to expose the inconsistencies in the way they live their lives before ushering them out of this world. He abides by some form of ethical code that only makes sense in his own mind and fully justifies his killings. His adherence to this code is what sends him to an internal state of ecstasy as he chokes a man and stares intently at the ceiling. The hunter is always frightening but Bardem is worse; he's unsettling.NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is entirely disconcerting but is somehow still a tranquil experience. There is a normality amidst the unrest that thrives in the plain, natural manner in which the story unfolds. The chase is constantly surprising without ever seeming forced. Each move made makes perfect sense but is not seen coming. On this level, even their formal execution of this film speaks to the trajectory of their career. Who knew that leaving quirk behind for harrowing humour and a story that serves itself instead of as a platform for character would invigorate the Coen's method and assert their place as two of the greatest American filmmakers operating in a country thought not to have any place for the them? I like to think they did. In doing so, they have also made a movie for a sharp adult audience in a country bent on catering to all things youthful and disposable.GRADE: A","

"lucasaq-1","16 November 2007","""You don't have to do this,"" repeated words in this lingering film, which really does not feel like a typical Coen Brothers film to me. Fargo, had its quirky character and its grotesque moments, but this film is all about a subdued natured intermixed with quick action. For what I expected, I got some of it, but also a bit more of a subdued air and timing than I expected. It would do things in spurts, action at the beginning then a lull and more thunder. It worked great for keeping one on edge, which Brolin did, excellently in the lead role lying awake thinking too hard. Jones too was good in a strong supporting role as a close to retirement sheriff who is on the outside shaking his head at the carnage and mayhem unleashed by the simple finding and taking of a satchel full of money.The real gem and glue of the film though is Javier Bardem's menacing character who has his own brand of justice, which is extremely harsh and well insane. Even the one who claims to know him cannot even begin to stop or even slow him down. Bardem whom I have not had the pleasure of seeing in anything before is gold and like no other before looks to have the supporting actor award locked up in this performance. His presence is felt, even when he does not show up. That is something I have not seen in film well since probably The Third Man and Orson Welles' character Harry Lime.I cannot really describe the film that well so I will suffice to say that is best modern western tale I have seen since The Three Burials of Melquiades, which also happened to have Tommy Lee Jones and was directed by him to boot. Another thing I noted was the lack of strong score. The filmmakers just seemed to let the sounds of the creaking boots and the desert landscape speak for the film. It felt natural and a bit menacing.","

"st-shot","22 November 2007","The Coen brothers are on firmer and more familiar territory with this Texas noir based on the Cormac Mc Carthy novel. Trailer park resident Llewellyn Moss stumbles upon the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad in the Texas desert and makes off with the fortune in cash. A machine like but philosophical psychopathic killer is soon in pursuit. An aging sheriff takes up pursuit of both with little success as bodies begin to litter the territory.The film is filled with some highly suspenseful moments and for the most part remains that way for much of the film. The pace maintains itself by shifting back and forth between three characters with a detour here and there to introduce other players and plot twists. The diversions and turns eventually become wearisome though and Country starts to slow down.No Country is vintage Coen. After the Big Lebowski (a worthy follow-up to their masterpiece Fargo) the brothers seemed to have lost their edge with four lackluster efforts. Country recalls their superb earlier works such as Raising Arizona, Blood Simple and Fargo and therein lies part of the problem. A lot of Country has scenes and characters directly lifted from these works. The Coen's are masters at oblique dialogue that gets to the heart of the matter and many scenes resonate with these elements giving them both tension and humor. Their originality and unpredictability of action and character can raise suspense in the most benign of settings. Their heroes and villains are complex. They are not 24-7 people of virtue or mindless cruelty. Their quirks flesh out and bring depth to their character thus increasing the possible directions of the plot.Tommy Lee Jones as the Sheriff is a burned out Andy of Mayberry moving from middle age crisis to old age and the uncertainty of retirement, always a step behind the bad guys. Jones conveys his fatigue and dogged determination in a fine measured way. Josh Brolin is even better as Moss who goes to great lengths to hold onto the money. Brolin, who stole acting honors in American Gangster as a corrupt jersey cop does so here as well as a stoic Texan. Based on these two roles alone he could be Americas best working actor. Woody Harrelson is badly miscast as a contract killer in a throw away role.What ultimately makes No Country for Old Men a disappointment is the handling of the villain, Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. The film, grounded in a dusty realism slowly starts to fall apart as Chigurh moves across the landscape like Boris Karloff offing locals with an unconcealed customized weapon. Even after a dozen people have been eliminated by Chigurh you get the impression that only Sheriff Bell is looking for him since Chigurh has no problem moving freely about spreading mayhem. The fascinating character that Chigurh is (he seems to be searching for the meaning of life as well as the stolen money) at the film's beginning degenerates into a Schwarzenegian Terminator manqué by the final reel and this strains the credulity of the movie beyond its breaking point.With Country the brothers Coen may be out of the rut that plagued there last few works but their wheels are still spinning.","

"SnoopyStyle","19 September 2014","Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) laments the bygone peaceful times of his father and grandfather. Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is a weird killer with a compressed air pistol. Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) comes across a drug deal gone wrong in the desert. The bad guys killed each other leaving the drugs behind. Llewelyn recovers a suitcase full of cash. He doesn't even tell his wife Carla Jean Moss (Kelly Macdonald) at first. He returns to the desert that night, and is shot by the criminals. They have his car and he expects them to come after him. He sends his wife away while he tries to hide the $2 million. Chigurh is brought in to track down the money and promptly kills the drug criminals who hired him. Sheriff Bell and deputy Wendell (Garret Dillahunt) investigates. The cartel hires Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) to stop Chigurh and get back the money.Javier Bardem creates a memorable villain. The Coen brothers have brilliant eyes for such uniqueness. They are also great movie makers. Their movies are always well put together. Every scene is something interesting. And the actors are in great hands with such well-drawn compelling characters. The brothers have done it again.","

"Rumplestilts","24 February 2008","If you don't like violence, steer clear of this film.As I watched this film I was reminded of some of the Stephen King novels I've read; kill off the characters until there aren't enough to sustain the story and then find a cheesy way out.But that gives too much credit to this film. Upon reflection, it appears as if someone lost the screenplay during filming and they began just ""winging"" it until they arrived at the last scene when TL Jones has his epiphany about the dream of his father. *cut* *print* Okay, everyone; time to go home.I guess I'm an old-fashioned kind of film-buff who like a story that makes sense beyond the first hour or so of the film.I'm giving the film a 3 (out of 10) simply because it provided an interesting waste of time for a good part of the evening. Maybe it's a ""3"" because of what could have been; otherwise I would have rated it lower.","

"Chris Knipp","7 October 2007","Cormac McCarthy's characteristically dry, laconic, and sometimes hilarious dialogue brightens the scenes of this superb and chilling thriller the Coen brothers have ably transferred to the screen with excellent help from Javier Bardem, Tommy Lee Tones, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, and others, including a salty second layer of minor characters who look like they sprang straight out of the sandy soil of West Texas.McCarthy, unmistakably one of America's greatest living writers of fiction, lives vividly in this, the Coens' first literary adaptation. Some of his best novels, notably Blood Meridian (called by Yale critic Harold Bloom one of the 20th century's greatest novels), are so apocalyptic, so embedded in their glorious poetic prose, as to be virtually unfilmable. All the Pretty Horses, from his Border Trilogy, has been filmed with some success (Matt Damon works in his role; Penelope Cruz doesn't). No Country for Old Men is late McCarthy. Post-apocalyptic, maybe. Jones's disenchanted, aging sheriff says, ""When you don't hear sir and ma'am any more pretty much everything else goes."" Llewelyn Moss (Brolin), a fairly innocent but opportunistic man, is deer hunting (he's not a good shot; he can't catch one out of a whole herd of them) when he finds a sprawl of wrecked vehicles and corpses, including Mexicans and a dog. There's a truckload of heroin in plastic packages and a briefcase containing two million plus in $100 bills. Moss takes the money and hightails it in his truck.Naturally there are people who want the money back. Not nice people.The man they hire to go after it is called Anton Chigurh. Expertly played by Javier Bardem, he's a villain--but with a clear-cut morality all his own--who's invincible and probably unforgettable. Chigurh is like the Grim Reaper: he can decide your fate with the flip of a coin; he reflects the biblical side of Cormac McCarthy, but in a terrible modern corruption. The crooks also hire another hit man, Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson)--a mistake, because Chigurh resents the duplication. He is the last word, the anti-Christ. No man may come after him.Out in these open spaces of West Texas--El Paso, the Mexican border--where Cormac McCarthy's innocent, pure-hearted cowboys used to roam in earlier decades, things have changed beyond recognition. This is 1977. It's a decade and a half since Vietnam. Lots of drugs and lots of money floating around; you don't hear sir and ma'am any more.The story turns into a chase, Chgurh after Llewelyn Moss, the sheriff coming after them. And then Carson Wells, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, and doomed, pops in to follow.People have been talking about Bardem's pageboy haircut. Yes, it's creepy. Bardem makes Chigurh both threatening and inscrutable. It seems he'd as soon kill you as look at you. He has a long rifle with a silencer and a high-pressure cattle-killer device with a tank that looks like something a person with emphysema would carry around. It kills instantly with a pop in the head. He also uses it to shoot out door locks.The film is more tense and suspenseful in the first half or so than in the grimly determined finale (all true to the book, if with a few details cut). By that time a lot of people have been killed and some wounded. This has some elements of the Coen's 'Fargo' and 'Blood Simple' (the latter introduced in an earlier NYFF) and thus with their most powerful work. But 'No Country' is an economical and faithful literary adaptation. Some Coen movies have been thin and frivolous lately. This is emphatically not, sure and riveting from the first few shots. Richard Deakins' photography, making much appropriate use of wide-angle lenses, is superb. Their distinguished source seems to have kept the Coens honest and serious (except for the dry humor built into McCarthy's talk). Unquestionably this will wind up being one of the best American films of the year. It's tight and vivid and suspenseful. It's great stuff. The images sing and stun. There's no distracting music, only the beauty and terror of real sounds.Present for the NYFF press screening Q&A (moderator Lisa Schwartzbaum): Brolin, Jones, Macdonald, Bardem, and the brothers Coen, Ethan and Joel.","

"billreynolds","6 December 2007",". . . by the most overrated filmmakers ever.""No Country for Old Men"" shares with other wildly overrated movies, like ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Collateral,"" a ludicrous setting in which criminals engage in wild shootouts and murder sprees lasting for days and days without any noticeable effort on the part of law enforcement to put a stop to it. NCFOM takes place in an alternate universe where an insane madman can travel across Texas murdering several people a day without the slightest hint of the FBI, DEA, U.S. Marshals, Texas Rangers, or any other authorities lifting a finger to stop him. The only cop who seems to be on his trail is an aging small town sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones who doesn't actually try to catch him but just passing amiably through life making philosophical reflections on evil.This movie has no interesting or sympathetic characters. Our supposed ""hero"" only gets in trouble because he commits an unbelievably stupid and selfish act -- stealing $2 million in cash from a drug deal gone wrong in which several people have already been murdered. Does he think no one will come after him? Then he compounds his idiocy by returning to the scene of the crime. Why should we care what happens to him after this beginning? He has what appears to be a very nice, likable girlfriend, whose life (along with his own) he endangers -- for what? Some blood/drug money that if the drug dealers don't kill him for taking, the cops will bust him for spending. Stupid. Besides which, the character has no backstory, no interesting qualities. He is a cipher.The character of ""Chigurh,"" over which all the critics are having such orgasms, might as well be an extraterrestrial, he bears so little relationship to actual human life. He appears to be in his late thirties -- killing people at a rate of two or three a day, as he does in this film, he must have murdered close to 10,000 in his adult life, without ever being apprehended. This man is almost on a par with Stalin, Hitler, Mao, and Pol Pot, except instead of killing people en masse as they did (using subordinates, secret police, and soldiers to do the dirty work), he appears to do every killing himself, many of them with some kind of oxygen tank (how clever, and how convenient it must be to lug around an oxygen tank to kill people with instead of, say, a handgun). And there is no FBI team on his tail, no worldwide manhunt to catch the biggest serial killer of all time. It's funny how many ""professional assassins"" there are in movies like this (and ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Collateral"") and how few there seem to be in real life.The plot of this movie is so unbelievably trite, clichéd, and hackneyed that it is simply boring. Of course, a trite story can still make a great movie if it is well done. But the Coen brothers are far above actually putting in the effort to make their story work effectively on a nuts and bolts level. For instance, why bother to show the ultimate confrontation between the hero and villain? Why would the audience care about that? On some level, the Coen brothers must be laughing at all the sycophantic critics falling all over themselves to heap orgasmic praise on this joke of a movie. This film, and its ecstatic critical reception, represents the ultimate elevation of style over substance -- the appearance of meaning over actual meaning, quirkiness and moodiness for its own sake rather than in the service of a genuinely engaging story and characters.","

"Smells_Like_Cheese","17 December 2007","No Country for Old Men is the movie that has everyone talking; this morning, I was reading how this is going to be the Oscar winning movie, I just had to find out where it was playing. I just saw this with my friend this afternoon and I was blown away. It's a little odd because this did not seem like a typical movie that I would love, but the performances were absolutely flawless and the writing was brilliant. My friend just kept saying how horrible it was, but I don't think some people are going to understand how great this movie really is or need to see it again to understand it. I was never really a fan of the Coen Brothers and their work, but the reason why I loved this movie is due to the fact that it points out the violence in the world and how far people will go to get money or drugs. No Country for Old Men is blunt and shows the ultimate evil of the world, but also the good as well.Llewelyn Moss is a cowboy who has just encountered quite a find, he stumbles across the desert to find several dead bodies and a truck load of heroin. When he walks a little farther, he finds another dead body, but there's something in a suit case that's a little bit more of what he could use, 2 million dollars! He's got everything in the clear, but he remembers one of the bodies that survived and needed water, so he goes back to help him out, big mistake. Now the serial killer who owned that money and drug load is after him. This serial killer, Anton Chigurh, is possibly the most cold blooded murderer and will not stop until he has his money and Llewelyn is dead. But also Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is trying to find Anton and find Llewelyn before it gets more deadly.No Country for Old Men is the most brilliantly written movie of the year. Javier Bardem, who plays Anton, will hopefully get an Oscar nomination for his performance. Javier pulled such a chilling performance, he was terrific and so frightening, I never really took a look at his talent until No Country for Old Men. Josh Brolin, it's truly amazing how far this man has come, from The Goonies to a gut-wrenching performance, he's great. Tommy Lee Jones also held his own very well and made the sheriff the most likable character and was the light in this dark movie. No Country for Old Men is a great movie, believe me, it's worth the watch, just take some time after the movie to think about it and what you have just seen, because for the first time, I can say that the Coen Brothers are really amazing.10/10","

I'll usually catch a second wind around two o'clock in the afternoon, so figured that would be perfect to see this film with a 2:20 start time. Now I know I was fully awake for the entire movie, but when it ended, I had to question myself as to what I'd missed. With this movie's shooting star flight path to #23 on the IMDb as I write this, I thought for sure that something must have eluded me or gone completely over my head. And then I heard the comment from another theater viewer as the screen went dark - ""Is it over?"" At least I had company.But here's the thing. I can't really disagree with a lot of the reviewers on this board gushing the praises of this picture. The performances were riveting, the tension was unnerving, and there were scenes that come out of nowhere to knock you clear out of your seat. The character of Anton Chigurh is so unrelentingly evil that he comes off like an Earth based version of the Terminator. However when all is said and done, the randomness of the final act that brings the story to a close (other than Tommy Lee Jones' dream narration), leaves the fate of Chigurh entirely unresolved. OK, so maybe real life is like that sometimes, but something MUST have happened to Chigurh after he walked away with the bone sticking out of his arm. But in this case, it's just not interesting to consider the possible alternate endings when the REAL film doesn't even give you just one.It's too bad too, because I'm a Coen Brothers fan from ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", ""O Brother Where Art Thou"", and the brilliant ""Miller's Crossing"". They've shown themselves to be competent writers and story tellers and each of their films grab you and they don't let go until the end. This one let's you go, and you wind up saying 'I'm not ready yet'. For what it's worth, I like to think that Llewelyn's wife won the coin toss.","

Why did the tommy lee bones guy have to be such a dimwit. I can understand the misanthropic point of view but it makes for an unsatisfying movie.

Josh Brolin was just fine, Javier Bardem was even scarier than the Biker of the Apocalypse in RAISING ARIZONA and Tommy Lee Jones really came off best of the three in a very subdued but likable role.NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is not a comedy, so people expecting laughs will sure be in for a surprise when they see this film. Instead, it's a very bloody, tense and occasionally difficult to watch suspense film that pays off in most every way except for a very unsatisfying ending. Even though I dislike violent films, I must admit that NO COUNTRY sure handled it amazingly well and kept my attention. It certainly was directed exceptionally well. I just hope its success doesn't encourage the Coen's to abandon comedy--which, I think, is much more their forte.Well, considering this film has 50000002 reviews so far, I think I'll stop here. Suffice to say it's a very good film but certainly NOT a film to let your kids see due to its very, very graphic violence.","

"MovieFanGuyy","14 February 2008","The Coen Brothers, one of America's most talented directors, with a string of terrific films behind them have changed Cormac McCarthy's controversial novel into the front runner at this year's Oscar ceremonies.Unforuantely, as in year's past, this film, is going to purely divide moviegoers. Critics and Academy members are going to reward the Coen brothers for their adaptation of McCarthy's novel. Moviegoers, on the other hand, seem to have a divided opinion of this film.I saw this film with a completely divided audience. The storyline, concerns a drug deal gone badly in the Texas outback. A retired welder and Vietnam veteran, played by Josh Brolin comes across a case full of thousands of dollars in the pick up truck of a Mexican drug dealer. Unforuantely he doesn't realize the case has a homing device, which hired killer, Anton Chigurh, played to complete chilling effect, by Javier Bardem who easily steals the movie from the rest of the cast, uses to track him down.Chigurh, has deadly ways of killing off those who stand in his way, including a contraption used to kill off livestock, which he uses to blow open door locks and people's heads off with ease. Chigurh, pursues Llewelyn Moss, played by Brolin and his wife, who he sent off to Odessa, in hopes of outrunning the cunning Chigurh, with only local sheriff, Bell, (Tommy Lee Jones) who has a chance of protecting them.I won't give much more details except to say that this film felt like half a movie, the two main characters' and their stories felt completely unfinished, and that was the key problem with McCarthy's novel. I am a huge fan of the Coen Brothers and their films, Fargo, one of the best films of the 1990s, The Big Lebowski, one of the funniest films I have ever seen, and a film that I watch on a regular basis, heck, I even enjoyed The Hucksucker Proxy, but, like last year, with the overrated, Martin Scorsese film The Departed, I think that critics and academy members are looking to reward the Coen Brother's work, rather than their film. I'm not going to say it's overrated, just that the ending felt completely unfinished. The film doesn't state what happens to either Chigurh, or Moss. The audience and many people who I have spoken with felt the film was completely unfinished, and felt like half a movie. I agree with them. Unfortunately, I think the academy will reward the Coen brothers for this film, rather than they did with their far superior Fargo in 1996 which covered similar territory as No Country For Old Men.","

"blanche-2","16 December 2013","Joel and Ethan Coen know how to tell a story -- sometimes its meaning is obscure, sometimes it's in your face, but it's always fascinating.In the obscure category is ""No Country for Old Men,"" from 2007, starring Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, and Barry Corbin.What I'm going to write next will mystify many. In a funny way, this film reminded me of Psycho. Here's why - in Psycho, we're led to believe that it's a story about a woman who steals money from her employer. Then she stops at the Bates Motel, and the story changes.Same deal here. This starts off as a story of a man who steals money he finds at a drug deal gone wrong, and we believe we're watching him trying to escape the man chasing him. Turns out the movie isn't really about that.In Texas in 1980, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the scene of a drug deal gone terribly wrong - the ground is peppered with dead bodies. Also laying around unattended is 2 million dollars, which Moss takes.As a result, a man named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is after him. Chigurh kills just about anybody who crosses his path. Moss is on the run, and Chigurh is close behind every step of the way.The sheriff, Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), has become discouraged by the evil in the world and his helplessness in the face of it. Nevertheless, he tries to beat Chigurh to Moss, all the while realizing the job has just about burned him out. It is, in fact, no country for old men.The film is symbolic of evil in human form (Chigurh) coming up against a decent man (Moss) and how it brings about his ruin. Moss' ego and arrogance make him think he can overcome Chigurh's pure evil. His innate goodness compels him to return with water for the one dying drug dealer at the scene, putting Chigurh on his trail when he finds his truck. Temptation, as in the Garden of Eden, can lead to ruin.All the men involved in the story -- Chigurh, Moss, Bell, and an old man whom Bell visits, Ellis - are all fatalists. Moral weakness allows the gods to wreak havoc. Llewellyn brings his fate on himself, and the fate can't be stopped. And so much that happens seems to happen by chance, as the result of a coin toss -- for someone like Bell, looking for meaning, there is no meaning to be found.The Coen Brothers take the western genre and turn it on its boots - we don't witness some of the deaths, and we don't witness the classic good versus evil fight. With Sheriff Bell's retirement, it seems that we are to conclude that evil wins. But the Coen Brothers leave us with hope, as long as we don't depend on mankind for it. Like Bell's dream about his father going ahead and starting a fire for him, the hope is outside of ourselves and our world. As we've seen in court cases, there is no getting of justice in this world. At the end of his dream, Bell says, ""I woke up,"" as we all must.A remarkable film by remarkable filmmakers, demanding multiple viewings.","

"McGrit","11 January 2008","You can believe all the negative things being said about this movie. What's remarkable is that it's such a bad experience that it turns out to be the ultimate pallet cleanser. What I mean, all other movies you see after having to endure this awful film will seem less bad by comparison. I realized this while walking out of the ""Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem"" showing. It's a terrible movie in its own right but I found myself saying, ""At least it wasn't as awful as NCFOM."" That's not a joke or an over-exaggeration in any way. Walking out of NCFOM, you feel cheated, disappointed and even a bit angry. How is any film going to make you feel worse then that? I wasn't expecting anything coherent from AVP and that's what I got. Judging by the ratings here and a few critics that I read, I was expecting at least a decent film from NCFOM. For those that think this movie offers a deep theme or a hidden, complex agenda, you need to grow up.The movie offers poor dialogue from the first scene on out. It's clichéd, needlessly cruel and the story itself is a trite disaster. The film exists only to jar the viewer and to attempt to be edgy and different. It offers nothing substantial, even in it's veiled attempts at allegory and a thematic message. It agitates the viewer at every level by callously killing any character they even half develop. What was the point of Woody's character? Why have the killer survive with no ramifications? Killing a main character (and his innocent wife) away from the camera is as poor as it gets. Let's not even discuss the ending, there are enough people that have mentioned that irritating lack of conclusion. I could go on but why bother? I'm not even going to remember the specifics of this film for very long. All I'll remember is the general unpleasant flavor it left and I'll remember that not many movies will leave such a poor taste. I'm not bitter. I'm grateful that going to the movies now has a bottom to the barrel in which to judge future films.I want to thank the creators of this film. It single handedly sets up better experiences for the rest of the year because nothing could possibly be worse then this movie.","

"judealexharnett","16 November 2023","Really interesting portrayal of a western. It was really well directed with brilliant cinematography and well developed characters. Javier bardem is such a cold villian. Top 10 on screen villians of all time and it was delivered really well. Every time he's on screen it's bone chilling. The symbolism throughout this movie showing how there is no justice in this world, simply just men and their fates. The coin toss scene was really cool of showing it. Although one thing In this movie that everyone seems to love that I wasn't the biggest fan of was the ending. It was good and I get what it was insinuating but I still didn't really like the character we were following for the whole movie getting off screened. 9.5/10.","

"Jacques98","2 September 2008","Let me start out by giving the number one flaw of this film. It gives boring movies a whole new definition. In reviews, I've said the phrase: ""Nothing happens in this movie, and I was so bored I fell asleep"" a lot of times, but this time I mean it literally. The only people with the attention span for this movie are either old people or people who have no more liveliness than old people. If there is a more boring movie ever made, I've yet to see it. And I've seen a lot of boring movies. It sacrifices entertainment value for moral, and as far as moral goes . . .The other huge flaw is the fact that it also gives pretentious a new meaning. It's easy to see the people who made this movie expected it to be praised for accomplishing nothing, a lot like something a little boy does before puberty. And if there is anything to criticize this film on other than the boring factor it's the fact at how ridiculously immature it is. The directors think it is something so deep and intellectual, but in reality it is simply one of the most basic and clichéd ""meanings"" or ""morals"" a film could have: people grow old and die. That's it. That's the huge physiological moral this film thinks it's so intelligent for making. Really, guys, can you name how many times you've heard that one? In case you're having a hard time remembering, I've heard it in everything from Disney movies like Pocahontas to pre-teen movies like Holes to teen movies like movies for everyone like Star Wars to action movies like Death Sentence . . . (four hundred movies later) . . . and you'd think people would realize how cliché that ""moral"" is. We get it. We die. Can't the directors think of anything, anything at all that is a little more original to bank on? But even worse than the fact it banks on such a cliché, the movie expects to be praised for it. It expects to put you in deep thought. It's no different than that 12-year-old boy thinking he can write a book on every bit of philosophy he knows and floor you with how genius he is.Okay, the other big thing the critics are raving about is the cinematography. Let me say this: it's okay. It's run of the mill. It's decent. It may be a tad above average, but you've seen better. Off the top of my head I can think of several movies with better cinematography that the critics hated, like Wolf Creek, for example. The acting, on the same hand, is pretty average. It was solid. It worked. But it is nothing to get all excited about! Javier Bardem, for example, did okay as your typical cliché 2-demnsional bad guy, but he certainly didn't deserve an Oscar. I can name several scenes where he looked incredibly corny. So, as you can see, where this movie doesn't go bad it just goes typical.As far as the plot goes . . . well, that's about as far as it goes. It's a plot. It's the basic plot they taught you back in middle school: guy wants something very badly, bad guy tries to stop him, and then in the end there is a confrontation. That's it. And I'm not simplifying itthat is literally the plot.Overall, the movie is just as typical as the critic-hated Disturbia. But here is something I've come to learn about the critics: they like things safe. They like plots that have been done more frequently than a slutty girl in high school with big boobs. They like typical, safe ideas and cliché morals that they've heard since they were kids. Anything that breaks that mold they trash because it's ""punk"" and ""punk"" is bad. As long as it's old, safe, and familiar it's good. If it's new, fresh, or original it's bad.I'm so glad I have more intelligence than critics like that. Hopefully you do too.0/10","

"hunterwhales83","11 December 2007","This was a movie I was initially going to avoid because I had seen the trailers so many times and was less than thrilled. However, after hearing a great review from one of my best film friends, who's opinion I respect highly, I thought what the hell I'll give this a shot.I'll admit I really enjoyed the the first half of the film up until the confrontation between Anton and Llewelyn where they first set eyes on each other. I loved the fact that no music is used, and I love that we know so little about the main characters as we go into the film, yet the acting and dialouge is done so well, although dialouge is sparce in this first half, that the characters all seem like very real people. Some of the tension in this first half is almost unbearable (in a good way). When we are at the second hotel and the tracking device starts going off and Anton walks right by the room as we hear the beeping. My god, I could barely sit still. And then the way the rest of this scene plays out as Llewelyn runs to the passing car, and the driver get's shot in the throat. Wonderful.However, after this confrontation, what happened to the tension? I was no longer gripped to my seat as we go and clear up subplots with Woody's character, that I could care less about. Does this tension compare to that of our protagonist's? Not even close. Yet you think that all this is building up to a final confrontation between Llewelyn and Anton, especially when the two talk on the phone. But no, this never comes. The next time we see Llewelyn, he is dead on a hotel floor. Along with his death goes the energy that kept this film rolling. I'm not saying that seeing this confrontation between Llewelyn and Anton is necessary, but there still needs to be away to keep the conflict rising, which the Coen brothers I guess forgot to do here.Instead we're left with a confrontation between Llewelyn's wife and Anton and some old food for thought from Tommy Lee Jones. Yeah, I liked the confrontation between Llewelyn's wife and Anton. But was it as good as the confrontation between her husband and Anton. Nope. I feel the Coen brothers were trying to emphasize the point of there story in this second half. Having to do with both fate and pure evil. Anton embodies both these things seeming to be a soulless monster who is on a mission that he has no control of. I've heard many praise his character saying that this is a great character study of a person who embodies pure evil. Well I have seen plenty of horror films where this character is represented as well, only Anton talks and gives a voice to this evil. And it's almost as if we know what he is going to say, that is exactly what any character of pure evil would say. And after all this we're left with Tommy Lee Jones little speech at the end. I had almost completely checked out at this point. Not because I wanted to (I guess it was fate) but because THE MOVIE no longer gripped me. I only caught bits and pieces of Lee's speech once again talking about fate, and then I was happy to leave the theatre.Sure this movie has themes of how money can make you cold and dead to life, fate, and pure evil. But is this done in a new refreshing way. No. Does it stir my mind in a different way. Nope.I have seen most of the Coen Brothers film, and I'm left disappointed almost every time. I think they are two of the most overrated directors that are alive today. I'm not saying they make bad movies, because they don't. It's only that I feel too many of their movies are heralded as genius when they are only in the category of good. This happens to be another one of them in the good.","

"Eric-Douglas-Statzer","3 November 2017","Rural Texas can be hard on anyone, even a rugged and tough Sheriff with a lifetime of exposure to it. No Country for Old Men exemplifies the grit of deep Texas and there's nothing better than a good chase. Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell balances his dangerous chase for a monster assassin with the equally dangerous chase for a good ole' cowboy that comes down hard on the bad side of some very bad people.Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss finds himself in a dangerous dilemma when he brushes up against a bloodbath of a drug deal gone terribly bad and a satchel with 2 million dollars inside. The man looking for that money is a dispassionate and inexpressive villain, Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. The rest ensues as a thrilling triple narrative, from a determined man with 2 million dollars on the run, only hoping to escape the mess that he stumbled upon, an old man sheriff facing an evil like none he's ever seen, and a psychopathic killer, an unstoppable evil with no remorse and a extraordinary determination to find what is his.With its blood-soaked scenes, grimy West Texas setting and haunting terror filled moments between characters, No Country for Old Men is both riveting and beautiful. The dialogue is flawlessly delivered and the performances are award worthy. With almost no music in the entire film you're left immersed and focused on how the Coens utilize sounds and silence to score the film. From wind gusts and boot steps on wood floors and concrete, to deafening silence within the dialogue, it's a score that's frightening and precise.-Eric Statzer","

"god-omelet","22 November 2022","This film is nearly perfect. Even now, 15y years later it still holds up and seems timeless. The dialog can be a tiny bit cute, with Sheriff Ed Tom dropping one-liners a mile a minute in his droll, deadpan way, but they are all great one-liners you will find yourself quoting to your friends. Anyway it's very funny and dark at the same time which is a tough balancing act that the Cohens perfected in this film.I should say that the cinematography is beautiful also. People talk about the amazing acting but the barren landscape of Texas doesn't seem to get much mention despite the ""Country"" featuring in the title itself plays a starring role in the film from the first scene.","

"vitaleralphlouis","23 November 2007","Anyone --- except the pseudo-intellectual elite --- who expects a quality movie based on the All Time Best Movie #45 rating on this site is in for a sad disappointment, and a waste of 2 hours.The Coen Brothers have been generating smug and self-loathing film noir wannabees for the past 25 years. Each time the loonies crawl out of the woodwork to level instant praise on whatever turkey the Brothers have roasted. In most cases, as here, more observant eyes will see only a pair of psychopaths who enjoy serial murders, creating new ways to kill and new (stupid) motivations for it. At least movie-making keeps these two would-be killers preoccupied.This time around, their imaginary multi-killer walks around with an oxygen tank-thing with a hose, using it like an air-gun he blows people's brains out, one after the other, for little or no reason. Supposedly interested in a suitcase full of $100 bills, he really prefers killing people -- like PacMan likes eating them. It reminds me of Richard Pryor's sick joke about killing people ""because they were home."" Tommy Lee Jones has starred in about 40 better pictures, and my only insight as to the multiple 10 ratings is that pseudo-intellectualism feeds on itself and can serve as a substitute for forming one's own opinion. Make no mistake, this movie has no saving grace.","

"vailsy","9 November 2007","there will be plenty of other reviews here on the story, acting etc etc but maybe less on the sound in the movie so i'll focus on that here..the Coen brothers are well known for paying close attention to detail in their soundtracks. i've always found in the past though that they have a tendency to go over the top with this, and the sound can become a little pretentious not so here. they don't try to do anything outlandish with the soundtrack but tremendous detail is placed on the effects and atmos in particular. just about everything sounds wonderful from the dropping of a bag, the uncurling of a wrapper to more 'interesting' sounds like the ricochet of a bullet from a metal bridge and of course the fantastic signature sound of our bad guy.. the nail/air gun. some wonderful atmos in the air duct for example, and even on the polished metal of a blown out door lock. subtle and excellent use of the surrounds is made, and i especially liked how they used this with some of the dialogue overall i was really impressed. and as you'll likely hear elsewhere, the rest of the film was great too!","

"Killa42","1 January 2008","No spoilers here Until the last half hour this looked like possibly one of the greatest films ever made. Then, the storm came and washed that idea away for me. I understood the symbolism of evil and all. But, for a movie that tried to be realistic, it failed to do so. For one thing it had some under qualified rambling sheriff played by Jones chasing the antagonist he barley tried, gave up fast, and mostly sipped on coffee. The psycho killed several along his journey and yet no one contacted the FBI which is protocol for escaped serial killers.We get it Coen's; old people don't get it and neither should you... bleh!The antagonist/ protagonist was chasing this hunter that found a bunch of money next to some dead bodies. They never explain how he knows about the money in the first place or (aside for one instance), how he finds people so easily but yet he just magically does. Next, Woody enters the movie for apparently no reason and while doing a great job at it he had a totally pointless role. You'll probably join the herds of others that liked this because that's what people do these days, they accept crap and smile at it as though it's gold. This doesn't come close to copper! P.S. I didn't like Fargo either","

"sam_smithreview","9 June 2016","Fargo, had its quirky character and its grotesque moments, but this film is all about a subdued natures intermixed with quick action. For what I expected, I got some of it, but also a bit more of a subdued air and timing than I expected. It would do things in spurts, action at the beginning then a lull and more thunder. It worked great for keeping one on edge, which Brolin did, excellently in the lead role lying awake thinking too hard. Jones too was good in a strong supporting role as a close to retirement sheriff who is on the outside shaking his head at the carnage and mayhem unleashed by the simple finding and taking of a satchel full of money.The real gem and glue of the film though is Javier Bardem's menacing character who has his own brand of justice, which is extremely harsh and well insane. Even the one who claims to know him cannot even begin to stop or even slow him down. Bardem whom I have not had the pleasure of seeing in anything before is gold and like no other before looks to have the supporting actor award locked up in this performance. His presence is felt, even when he does not show up. That is something I have not seen in film well since probably The Third Man and Orson Welles' character Harry Lime.I cannot really describe the film that well so I will suffice to say that is best modern western tale I have seen since The Three Burials of Melquiades, which also happened to have Tommy Lee Jones and was directed by him to boot. Another thing I noted was the lack of strong score. The filmmakers just seemed to let the sounds of the creaking boots and the desert landscape speak for the film. It felt natural and a bit menacing.","

"MovieAlien","17 November 2007","Faithful or not to the novel which the film is based on, the one thing the Coen Bros. recent work lacks is a solid narrative. Sure, the movie is seen from 3 characters' POV, but the central focus is supposed to be on Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) an underused and uninvolved character, and extremely awkward to the indisputably gripping premise.Yes, I understood the film. I got the ""evil triumphing over good"" symbolism, the Biblical undertones and social commentary on modern society ... how someone on the street - bloodied from shotgun wounds - would only get blank stares from pedestrians, and even a half-finished bottle of beer (for comfort) would come with a price.Unfortunately this bleakness is the tip of the iceberg when you factor in cold-as-ice psychopath Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who massacres almost everyone in his path while in pursuit of $2.4 million from a drug deal gone bad. Because the film is supposed to be ""symbolic"", little is known about Anton and his connection to the money other than a shady guy in a high rise (played by Stephen Root), but even his motives are never clear. In addition, Anton's modus operandi makes it hard to believe he would associate with anyone. The violent lone wolf prevails at the end, and after the naive man who salvaged the money (Josh Brolin) is killed at a motel, Anton fulfills a perverted deal he made by visiting the man's newly widowed wife (Kelly MacDonald) and informing her of impending doom. There is no problem with villains who succeed at the end. It has been done before. Whilst not the best example, Aaron Stampler from the novel/movie ""Primal Fear"". There's a sense of disgust and dread, but at the same time awe at how someone so evil (and yet so smart and clever) could override justice. But so little is known about Anton Chigurh that he comes off as nearly what Bell calls him - a ""ghost"". He's cunning and skillful, but no indication whether he's a survivalist, ex-Navy SEAL, renegade intelligence operative, etc. Credibility is totally thrown out the door for the viewer. As for the themes: It has been done before. The vicious cycle of greed was portrayed perfectly in ""Fargo"", even in movies not from the Cohen brothers; Times have been changing in the criminal world for a long time, longer than Bell admits. Bell disregards the outlaws of the Old West, he disregards serial killers and bank robbers active around his early years, and most of all the national formation of the mob ... The movie's performances are first rate, as is the sound editing and misleading appearance as a ""suspense thriller"". While not a bad film, the abruptness, clichés and lack of cinematic cohesion prevent a positive review.","

"bob the moo","17 February 2008","While tracking a wounded animal to finish it off, Llewelyn Moss comes across the aftermath of a bloody shootout, seemingly of a drug deal gone terribly wrong. The drugs are still there but everyone is dead apart from one man who will be soon. Llewelyn finds the money and an attempted get-away only a few ridges away and keeps it. Later that night his conscience gets the better of him and he returns to check on the dying man. Unfortunately he is too late but this time he is noticed by those also looking for the money and he flees, leaving his truck behind. Knowing this will lead the criminals to him, Llewelyn packs his wife off to her mother's and he sets off with the money. Following in his wake however is an man sent to recover the money, Anton Chigurh, for whom ""evil"" is much more than a concept. Far behind both of them is aging sheriff Ed Tom Bell, who can only wonder at the daily violent outrages he has to witness.Many others have already said it so I can only echo when I say that this is a real return to form for the Cohen brothers after a handful of amusing but yet not that good films including The Lady Killers, Intolerable Cruelty and so on. In something of a marriage made in heaven, the Cohens and author Cormac McCarthy have produced a great film out of what simply could have been a ""everyman dragged into job gone wrong"" thriller if it had been given to anyone else. It is impressive how they still work within this genre and produce more than expected while also still working effectively in the areas one would expect such a film to do. I have listened to those who claim it was boring and far too slow and I am afraid I just cannot really understand the point of view  far less agree with it. Likewise I have watched those leaving the cinema ten minutes from the end, I can only assume because with Llewelyn dead then the ""plot"" is closed for them and they might as well beat the traffic.On the contrary, for me this film worked across so many levels that I cannot imagine leaving at any moment other than the end, and even then the film will stay around for longer than that. The slow pace never feels anything other than appropriate as it is either doing or of two things, or both. The opening and closing scenes are a fine example of how meditative it all is and this suits the pace. The film is thoughtful on the subject of violence and evil, with the title and the material questioning whether things are worse or just different (cleverly it is also set in the eighties). I found this fascinating even if I didn't understand all of it. Working alongside this is the constant tension associated with the main plot. It is unbearably tense at times and the slow pace only serves to heighten this and make the moments of sudden violence all the more impacting. With these two things working so well together I really had zero issue with the slow pace.The Cohen's delivery is note perfect throughout with the characters and places being just that little bit quirky but not to the point where the violence or menace is affected in the slightest. They pace the material and perfectly balance the gripping with the thoughtful. I particularly liked the way that they handled scenes of violence  while thrilling, the viewer is never ""pumped up"" by them or excited but rather sickened or just plain deadened. It suits the material again and somehow seeing the casual aftermath of, for example, Carla's death, is so much more meaningful than seeing it occur. The cast respond well to this direction and turn in solid performances across the board. Brolin (who suddenly seems to be in everything) is a firm ""everyman"" character who we root for but not to the point where we lose the other two main characters. Jones is perfectly still and reflective and his ""good ol' boy"" mannerisms are underlain with an increasing sense of bewilderment and frustration that makes his scenes work so much better  which was important. The most impacting turn comes from Bardem, who simply personifies evil with a performance that made me want to edge away from him, far less the other characters. His scenes sparkle with menace and he represents everything that Jones' character worries over  even a simple scene in a garage is gripping due to his delivery and simple logic. Trainspotting's Macdonald gives a great performance and a great accent in her role, with a great scene late on. As per Cohen tradition, the smaller characters are amusingly quirky and fit the Texan world of small towns, with motel owners and so on all amusing in their (often fatal) interactions with the main players. Special mention for Harrelson who is so-so for much of it but is utterly convincing when he finds himself totally out of his depth in this world he tried to be in (his offer of $14k as telling as his reddening skin and panicked eyes).At the end the tone is downbeat but for me it is fitting as we close as we opened, on a meditative slant, sending the audience away thinking. It is a quite remarkable film that manages to be thoughtful but yet unrelentingly tense producing quirky amusement in some scenes but never at the expense of the impact of the violence, which is terrifying offhand at times. No Country for Old Men stands above the recent output from the Cohen's and easily stands alongside their greatest work such as Blood Simple, Fargo and so on.","

"CineCritic2517","10 January 2008","Half way into this movie I was still positively upset that this was probably going to be the first time I would ever actually enjoy a Coen movie. We all like what we like but none of their prior movies (And I did see them all) did anything other for me than bore or annoy.Of course I should have known better because the very reason the Coen productions annoy me is that none of their movies take place on earth. No-Country-for-old-Men turned out to be no exception. Far from it even.Somewhere in a paralleled universe there is a little blue ball of mud and water that looks very much like our own planet. The difference between our world and this one is a difference in certain laws of logic.On planet Earth as I know it, if a dude in scene 1 would tell a dying Mexican to go fork himself when he's asking for water, walking away with 2 million dollars with no expression on his face, he would probably not have problems with his conscience a couple of hours later only to fill up a cannister of water and go back in remorse. On my world, if a cop would be killed, there would probably be a thorough investigation (even in Texas). But not in the world of the Coens. If a man with a funny hairdo would walk around a town or a motel with a 90 inch hand-cannon with a strange aluminum front, people on earth would call the police. But not on planet Coen. The list goes on filling up a roll of toiletpaper if one would take the time.And there you have it. Where in normal films one is required to suspend some disbelief, in this movie you'd have to let it slide altogether. And that is exactly where the movies for me quit to entertain. They annoy more than they amuse even though set-designs, acting and cinematography are almost always on par with any quality movie or even above.And like this wasn't enough to cast serious doubt on this production, they put in a terrible anticlimax of an ending...dared but ultimately flawed and annoying. -SPOILER-START- How they expected to get away with showing a movie for 1.5 hours, closely following the protagonist, and having him being killed off-screen in a 12 second scene, is beyond me.-SPOILER-END- And since when is mumbling some cod-philosophical verbal diarrhea a good replacement for closure in a movie which desperately needed some sensible conclusion? I know that the entire theater I watched this movie with felt exactly the same about this. Everyone was going 'huh?', 'This is it?' or started apologizing for picking the movie to the people they were with or even started arguments with employees of the theater. Everyone felt unanimously cheated. And this set against the incredible high praise this movie has received, makes absolutely no sense.If I had to judge the movie based on the first half of it, it would have scored a 7,5 in my book because it was all delivered convincingly and graciously although a bit meandering at times. But such a lousy and unsatisfying ending should not go unpunished, especially in the reviews of the movie-critics who write their reviews for the moviegoers and not for themselves nor their peers nor the Coen Brothers.5/10","

"CinemaSerf","26 November 2022","Javier Bardem is just great in this! He is ""Anton"", a ruthlessly efficient killer on the hunt for a missing bag of loot that has fallen into the hands of the opportunistic ""Moss"" (Josh Brolin) after a drug deal goes awry. The latter man soon cottons onto the fact that his life is now considerably more at risk and he has to figure just out how to survive long enough to escape and enjoy his cash. ""Moss"" might just have an unlikely and unwitting ally, though, in the form of the pursuing but rather unenthusiastic sheriff ""Bell"" (Tommy Lee Jones) but, well you just wouldn't want to bet against the truly menacing Bardem! It's violent and brutal, sure - but it's also darkly humorous with plenty of pithy banter and quite some degree of characterisation from both Brolin and Bardem as the denouement looms large. That conclusion is as unpredictable as the rest of this quirkily scary and entertaining crime drama that uses an oxygen cylinder with startlingly effective results in this game of lethal Russian Roulette. Nobody is safe, nobody is innocent - and it doesn't matter whose side you are, ostensibly, on either. It's perfectly paced by the Coen brothers, the characters and the story given ample opportunity to develop and to breathe and by the conclusion I was definitely rooting for someone! It has shades of the old wild-west Texan Western genre to it, it reeks of authenticity and is really well worth a watch.","

"m_a_singer","21 December 2007","I honestly can't tell what they were thinking when they did this. The script is a mess, full of afterthoughts and misfires and very short on any sort of actual point or significance. It just sputters along with stabs of pointless violence and splashes of awkward humor that are mostly based on casting ugly people and then making them sound stupid. The bad guy is Freddy Kruger with a Prince Valiant haircut, Tommy Lee Jones is wasted, Woody Harrelson is (pardon) wasted, a lot of really nice scenery is wasted. It isn't even particularly well shot despite the fact that it is the often-brilliant Roger Deakins. Joel and Ethan Coen have made two of my favorite films and others I have enjoyed, but this is just sadly wrong.","

Everyone in the audience was going ""WTF?"". What the hell just happened? I cannot believe the critics gave this a good review, nor can I believe the users are giving it such a high score. Towards the end, there are some characters that come into the movie, then disappear, and you have no idea who they are or why they are in the movie. And what the heck was Woody Harrelson's character there for? It could have been such a good movie, if it just hadn't stopped in the middle.","

"saytosandeep","13 October 2013","No Country For Old Men. It's a near perfect western thriller gone somewhat wrong in the end. Hero a hunter himself finds a bag full of money from a crime scene but then gets hunted down by a crazy lunatic killer. Adding other dimensions there is aging sheriff trying to help hero without his knowledge. The movie starts and flows like a clean water with edgy characters, tricky situations and some clever ideas. Then when you are all set for bang-bang climax, movie takes a different route, plot becomes ambiguous, motives become unclear and our hero is out of the story just like that. If you are not overly miffed by the deviation in last half an hour, then you would be attracted to this like an iron to magnet because of its crazy characters, witty dialogs, haunting atmosphere and chilling silence.","

"tedg","10 December 2007","How can I be disappointed by a good movie?I suppose I should say at the outset that this IS a good movie. You should see it. Its all about the writing, though.McCarthy's writing style comes after the Clancy/Ludlum model where things are diced into parallel episodes but unified in a grand arc driven by the cosmic principle that good triumphs and the bad guys get punished. This has become the cinematic norm, so whenever we pass through a scene-story, we know how it fits in a universe powered by a machine of justice.McCarthy has the intelligence to open the world, introducing into his novels the notion of apparently unraveled justice. We do have episodes. We do cling to some of the traditional formula: drugs, mob boss, the hunted, the west, the champion of justice. Each of these is used conventionally. Its no accident that Tommy Lee was selected to play the part, because we assume he will be the hunter from Fugitive, the agent who adjusts things to their proper order. Its no accident that all the ordinary pieces of this are made from the same stuff we'd find in airport books and their coincident movies.But its also no accident that McCarthy's books draw on the cinematic revolution. His images assume that you can see, not imagine. That way he can do two novel things. One is that he can show by not showing, for instance Moss's actual death. This separation between the imagined and the shown also allows him to elevate the imagined into substance. This film, for instance, starts and ends with annotative stories. They aren't directly linked to the action we see, but they have agency, power and they come close enough to being parallel episodes that we accept them as relevant.The other cinematic notion that McCarthy uses is noir, and I am certain that it is what attracted the Coens. They've spent their entire careers surrounding this notion, probing it from all directions. In absolute terms, what defines noir is the notion that the machinery of the universe is arbitrary and linked to the act of viewing. That ""viewing"" piece has stickiness, because it involves us in what happens to the characters in the world we witness. McCarthy makes us explicitly complicit in the unraveling of ordinary, even expected justice. Its all wonderful. Its all perfectly comprehended and presented by the Coens. Its clean. It works. Its poetic and deserves to be near the top of anyone's list. If nothing else, the Coens know how to end a movie, probably the most elusive element of narrative skillcraft.So why am I unhappy?Because the Coens play a special role in my film life. They are the folks who play games, who explore, who tease and question. They are the Bob Dylans of film. When they create something it has all sorts of extra annotative froth in it, usually cinematic in nature. Its baroque introspection where they pile twisted ironies on top of dishonest self-reference. They are the master of woven layers, of meandering narrative stance. They break where breaks are needed and not expected. They write their own vision, and clearly have that vision first.Here, they start with someone else's vision already written. Here they stick to the clean, the bones not the coral. Here they deliver directness. Their ambiguity is direct, not tangled. Yes, I can celebrate what they've done here. And sure I can say that they did well. But isn't that what we have Ang Lee for? PT Andersen? Sean Penn? When the Coens simply rely on their competence, they steal from us the things that they uniquely can do: confabulate and confuse reality. Now that Woody is all but retired, we need them more than ever, Dude.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

"shark-43","13 December 2007","I am a fan of the Coen Brothers(Raising Arizona, Fargo, Barton Fink, Big Lebowski and Blood Simple) and yet I have also sat through films of theirs that just didn't work -- even with entertaining moments -- (Hudsucker Proxy, Miller's Crossing, O' Brother, etc.) - so I went in thinking I was just going to love this new one - especially with all the rave reviews in the press and I was with it - really enjoying it - until the shootout in the El Paso Motel room - from that moment on I felt the movie was off the rails and in the ravine. The acting is excellent - the cinematography is brilliant, but overall - I was disappointed with the final act. I understand the Coens were very faithful to the book (which is to be commended yet there are times one has to realize you are visually telling a story) but maybe they were TOO faithful. I'm not one of these viewers who needs things explained or wants everything tied up in a ribbon - but to invest so much time in Brolin's character and then not even SEE his demise - well that just ticked me off. And I also felt that once Brolin found the money (which is a good plot point for dozens and dozens of crime films) the movie just kind off moved from one bit to another - some of them amazing but some of them bland and one-note. The scene with Bardem messing with the old timer who runs the gas station is one of the best, most tension-filled scenes I have ever watched - brilliantly acted, written and edited. Bardem (who is so damn good in Night Must Fall), Brolin and the rest of the cast are terrific - I loved Tommy Lee Jones' opening narration but I must be in the minority in not liking his little speech about his dreams at the end. I think it's a good film, a flawed film but not a great film.","

"Horst_In_Translation","7 November 2015","""No Country for Old Men"" is the Coen Bros' adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel from almost 10 years ago. This film won 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and while I have doubts to say this is my favorite film of the year and not ""There Will Be Blood"", there is no denying that ""No Country for Old Men"" is among the finest the year 2007 had to offer. The movie runs for slightly over 2 hours, with credits, and takes us into the world of Llewelyn Moss who finds a huge amount of money. For almost the entire movie, he is on the run from contract killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem, Oscar winner) with Tommy Lee Jones playing Ed Tom Bell, a sheriff who, on the other hand, is trying to help Moss and catch Chigurh. Woody Harrelson and Kelly McDonald play important characters too.It has always been the Coens' strength to include characters in their movies who may be minor, but are still very memorable. Their recent movie ""Inside Llewyn Davis"", my favorite from the brothers, is a great example of that, but this film here is as well. Garret Dilahunt playing a sheriff's assistant was as fun to watch as Kathy Lamkin's one-minute, one-scene character: ""We can't give out no information."" This scene actually gave out a nice piece of information on Chigurh. I don't think he let her live because there was somebody else when we hear the noise of somebody flushing the toilet. He is not scared of attracting attention in other scenes by killing several people in the same location. I think he was impressed by how much of a professional the woman was, even in the face of such a dangerous man like him, so she did not even have to go through his coin toss procedure. Actually, Chigurh and women is a chapter interesting enough to write a full article about on its own. For example, he offered Carla Jean the chance to live at the end, even if he promised Llewelyn otherwise. And then there is that ""You married into it."" scene of course.In general, this film is packed with tense, brilliantly atmospheric material from start to finish, be it the dog chase scene, the scene when we see Chigurh turn out the lights in the hallway as he knew Moss would see him, the scene with Chigurh and Bell almost facing each other or the final monologue by Tommy Lee Jones' character. I have heard about interpretations Chigurh and Bell are actually the same person. There are some indicators that it may be true, especially the face-off I just mentioned, but who knows. In general, my personal perception is still that it is not the case. That's entirely subjective though. In any case, the Coen's created one of the most memorable villains in film history here (with the help of McCarthy, of course). The way they used Chigurh's coin as a depiction of luck and fate was simply brilliant and it's very telling that, while Chigurh was always in charge with human enemies following him (he killed most of these), he picked the wrong side of the coin in the end apparently when something completely unexpected happens. But this is what luck and fate is all about. You cannot influence it. Great last scene with Bardem's character for sure. I am truly curious what happens to him next. This scene also makes for a nice parallel with Moss' scene earlier when he pays a lot of money for the jacket (being the somewhat good guy) and Chigurh gets the shirt for free (being the bad guy). Life's not fair. Neither is this movie. But it's very outstanding and a great achievement of filmmaking. Highly recommended.","

"jpismyname","28 January 2023","Set in Texas in 1980, No Country of Old Men is a thriller Western movie that tells the story of three men: one is a hunter who stumbles upon dead bodies and a briefcase containing millions of dollars and then takes it, the second is a psychopathic hitman who tries to find the man who took the briefcase, and the third is a sheriff trying to solve the murder spree left by the hitman.The film started out good with a great acting. Joem Bardem's character really is intense and scary as well. I mean, everyone is fantastic. The action scenes are pretty much intense as well, especially during that chase scene with Moss and the dog. But I was left wondering, why did he even go back there in the middle of the night? For what??But honestly the latter half of the movie went downhill. The climax fell flat, I mean if you even call it a climax. Moss was killed off-screen, not even sure if he was killed because they never really show his body aside from the woman on the pool, which obviously was the one asking him to drink beer with her. I mean, that was shocking, I gotta say.The latter parts of the film and the ending felt empty and unsatisfying.I think this movie is also supposed to be artsy or whatever, where you have to think/figure out why certain things in the movie happened, and you have to put the pieces of the puzzle together on your own. I mean I don't really mind that sometimes, but it just doesn't work for me in this movie.Overall I didn't really care much about this movie. It's not a bad one, but it certainly is not a Best Picture for Oscar material for me.","

"dr_foreman","10 November 2007","I'm maybe not the best person to review No Country for Old Men. I long ago became tired of movies about assassins, drugs, shootings, and suitcases full of money. I feel as though Hollywood has been recycling the same seedy crime material for years - and so have the Coen brothers. Movies like this one, Fargo, Blood Simple, Sin City, Pulp Fiction, and Smokin' Aces all seem to come from the same mold, and that mold is getting mighty overused, in my opinion.On the plus side, I think the Coen brothers are uniquely gifted at presenting this kind of material. Indeed, No Country for Old Men is, in many ways, one of the most beautiful and suspenseful films that I've seen in a long time. It's full of striking images of the desert, interesting point-of-view shots, and incredibly intimate close-ups of actors with fascinating faces. Even the sound effects are great; they're loud, vivid and realistic, and they genuinely enhance the action.But beyond all that surface glitz, what is the movie about? I never really understood or cared for any of the characters. The protagonist is unsympathetic from the beginning, for instance. Tommy Lee Jones, meanwhile, gives a good performance but seems to be virtually trapped in a subplot. Furthermore, his ""deep"" dialog did very little for me - ""mock profundity"" is perhaps an apt description. The villain is great, I suppose, but once you've seen him kill twelve people, there's not much point in seeing him kill a thirteenth, is there? I don't want to bury this movie, because it's very well done. But I'm annoyed that, at usual, film critics and students are heaping an avalanche of praise on a movie that's really violent, really strange, and really alienating. Yeah, sure, it plays with narrative conventions in interesting ways. But it doesn't take true genius to frustrate an audience's expectations, and storytelling gimmicks alone can't save a story that's so barren. I suppose you could hunt for deeper meaning - as people tend to do on message boards - but I don't think there's much to find. The movie is a beautiful toy, and not too much more.","

It's as if the screenwriter hadn't a clue how to write such a scene so why bother!

"WriterDave","12 November 2007","A Vietnam vet (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and casually takes off with two million dollars that a psychopathic bounty hunter (Javier Bardem) will do anything to get back. Meanwhile, a Sheriff nearing retirement (Tommy Lee Jones) strolls behind the mayhem always a few steps behind. Set in Texas in 1980, ""No Country for Old Men"" is a meticulously crafted misfire from the Coen Brothers and adapted for the screen from the Cormac McCarthy novel.Roger Deakin's stark cinematography matches perfectly the brilliant mise-en-scene and signature Coen Brothers' pacing. The audience is also treated to a revolving door of quirky side characters and dark deadpan humor in the dialog that have become the trademarks of a Coen Brothers' dramatic production. It would seem to be a return to form, but there's a wandering coldness to the film that leads to grave dissatisfaction.The most disappointing aspect is that there's a near perfect forty-five minute ""mini film"" riddled with white knuckle suspense involving the cat-and-mouse shoot-em-up between Bardem and Brolin that is lost inside yet another dour opus where Tommy Lee Jones plays a grizzled but good-hearted authority figure philosophizing about the sad state of the world for the umpteenth time. While Bardem and Brolin are sensational, Tommy Lee Jones seems to be playing an on-screen persona that has trumped his ability to show any type of range. He's typecast, and his character is made moot. Meanwhile Bardem gives a career-defining performance as the psychopath working with his own warped sense of morals. In what may prove to be ironic in the future, it's exactly the type of portrayal that risks making Bardem typecast in the same vein Anthony Hopkins was after his Hannibal Lecter character was born.The brooding tension built around Bardem's unforgettable villain and the inevitable showdown with Brolin's wayward cowboy is completely wasted in anti-climactic fashion with no resolution that leaves the film to meander in philosophies that ultimately signify nothing. Coming off three straight comedies (the last two of which, ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""The Ladykillers"", were abysmal) the Coen Brothers have clearly lost their footing in trying to get back to their roots. ""No Country for Old Men"" boasts many of their popular hallmarks and an instantly classic turn from Javier Bardem, but it lacks the moral fiber of ""Fargo"" and the dramatic climax of ""Blood Simple"". Coming home, it seems, isn't as easy as it looks when the roads are dusty and lead you nowhere.","

"jp71ph","5 March 2008","It was not very long before I watched 'No Country for Old Men' that I watched the other remarkable film of 2007, 'There Will Be Blood.' Back then I thought that Paul Thomas Anderson has delivered the Best Picture of the year with his oil epic, but after watching the Coen brothers chilling and violent adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel, I knew right away that here was a film destined to be even a greater film than any I've seen this past year.It's not easy to watch 'No Country for Old Men.' The first time I saw it, I found myself dazed enough to not be able to stand-up immediately even after the whole end credits have finished. And yet, mixed with the feeling of shock is the profound sense of wonder and awe with what I have just witnessed on the screen. It took me another viewing to fully appreciate the meaning and intention of the film, and while the experience from watching the film is not one everybody will enjoy and understand, it certainly is one of the most moving and thought-provoking movies I have ever watched. This is the kind of movie that will make you think, the kind that stays with you even after a long time has passed since you've last watched it. On the literal level, it is a simple cat-and-mouse chase thriller movie, but from within its roots lie a very profound philosophical and penetrating analysis not only of the characters and the situations involved in the story, but also of the kind of world we are living in today and the more monstrous sides of it we often choose to ignore.The story revolves around the chase between a guy named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin,) who stumbles upon a stash of money in a drug deal gone wrong in the middle of the desert and a psychopathic but surprisingly ""principled"" assassin named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). The third party and the moral center of the story is the guy trying to find both the hunter and the hunted, Ed Tom Bell, the old sheriff of a peaceful, but increasingly becoming violent locality in West Texas. The movie features the perfect mix thrill and excitement that would be expected out of a movie in this genre. The Coen brothers' direction of the particularly intense chase scenes between Chigurh and Moss are masterful, evoking emotions of suspense to the highest level and pushing the audience to the very edge of their seats. This is achieved by very careful editing and sound direction that perfectly recreates the tense atmosphere whenever a particular scene is being played out. Also remarkable is the photography (done by Roger Deakins) of vast scenes in the desert where even what the ordinary moviegoer would consider as ""empty scenes"", where no action is played out, tells a story in a visual manner, where even when there is no dialogue or action on screen, the sweeping images speak out for themselves.'No Country for Old Men' is rich in such bravura kind of film-making. The particular camera move, position and choice of background and other trivial details such as time of day, cloud cover or positioning of the props and point-of-view perspective offer the best experience for the audience, and the most effective means of story-telling for the Coen brothers. Just watch the scenes of Tommy Lee Jones as the tormented old sheriff being burdened by the challenge of something that is greater a force than himself, something that he ""does not understand,"" and you will realize what I mean. The environment and tone created by the filmmakers perfectly accentuates the performance of Jones and more importantly, the core messages of the film. This style is present throughout the film and one of the particular points that makes it more than just a chase movie.I must say that I can't help but agree to most people when they say the Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh is the most disturbing character (and yet mesmerizing) to grace the screen since Anthony Hopkins introduced us to Hannibal Lecter in 'Silence of the Lambs.' Chigurh effectively radiates evil and embodies violence in a very intelligent and forceful manner that touches the fear in all of us. Like Lecter, he personifies evil not in the conventional and simple sense, but in way that somehow presents to us the whole magnitude and complexity of its nature. In the dialogue he speaks, a kind of thinking revealed is one that is calculating and deeply philosophical but essentially ruthless and sinister.The film's monumental achievement is in its ability to remarkably transport us into a world where the places, emotions, fears, anxieties, choices, morals and realities of life are strikingly brought to life and presented to us in a manner where we, after the whole experience, can reflect upon and look back with careful consideration. In the end, the moviegoer is left to marvel at the beauty (and madness) of it all. Here the theme of innocence lost as it is corrupted by evil and violence is explored in the most cinematic fashion, delivered perfectly with richness of emotion and the greatest impact possible. The violence and bleakness of it all is not there to simply evoke reaction or engage the audience, it is there to tell a story and impart an experience of great magnitude and intention, to which the Coen brothers have brilliantly succeeded. All at the same time the movie is a character study on the effects of evil and innocence lost, an exploration on the themes of fate and chance, an analysis of the freedom to choose and its consequences, a reflection on evil and good as forces of society and the investigation of basic human emotions such as hope, fear, love, violence and aspiration in the face of a variety of situations.","

"Anyanwu","1 January 2008","I enjoyed ""Fargo"" which I feel is their best work, but ""No Country"" was boring. The acting was fine, but the story just didn't inspire me. Usually a really good movie makes me want to go out a write ( I am a screenwriter myself). It gives me hope that there are some good stories out there being made into film. But this one...I dunno, it was like someone put a lump of cookie dough onto a baking sheet, and the cookie didn't bake. So you're left with a lump of..cookie dough. I got up in the middle of the movie to buy popcorn and a soda, used the restroom just to entertain myself. I NEVER do that at a good movie. I stay planted and aware. But I had to get away from it for a few minutes. Thank God we didn't pay a lot to see it.I'm not going to go all out intellectual on this puppy, because frankly, I don't have th energy to nitpick every detail, so I'll skim over a few things that bugged me. I've read some of the other postings by fans of the movie. It seems that the few folks who dislike the film are accused of not ""understanding"" the greatness of the Coen brothers themes on violence in America..blah,blah,blah. I love movies, seen a lot (foreign and American made) so the reality is, this movie didn't work FOR ME. It bored me, left me uninspired and I regret that I didn't wait until DVD. Potential ""spoiler area"" ahead. You were warned.1. They did try something interesting, which is kill off a lead character by the third act. But Tommy Lee Jones's character was not that interesting to sustain the last section of the film. As a writer, I applaud the bait and switch technique of taking out a character that we've followed from the beginning. However, having Tommy's monologue at the beginning, and showing him later in the film does not help sustain his presence once his character takes over in the third act. Plus, his being an old gunslinger weary from the battle is old. I kept wondering if the dynamic would've shifted dramatically had this been a younger sheriff. Every time Tommy Lee came on screen, I just got tired because who looked so drained. I understand this was probably an attempt to be the ""message"" of the film, (How do old folks deal with changes they can't fathom?), but I've seen that too many times.2.""Quirky"" dialogue by the killer and potential victims was not enough to pull this clunker together. As stand alone vignettes at a short film festival, it would've been entertaining. But to string them throughout two hours kills me, and smacks of pretentious dribble. Perhaps if they had opened up the film with that scene in the gas station, prior to us knowing who Bardem's character is, it would've set a tone of unease, given us the rules of the killer's world.Prepared us with the sense of dread whenever he appears then cut to his short capture, and then onto the idiot Moss and his discovery. For this project, I didn't buy it. It smells like a writing technique/device to razzle dazzle us so we don't notice that nothing is really happening.3. Stupid people do stupid things and kill any chance of me rooting for them. Moss was plain stupid. Although this is set in 1980, don't make the person who we follow in the story stupid. You find money. You take it. You do NOT go back in the middle of the night to bring a man water, A man who you left in the hot desert sun all day. If your conscience bothers you that much, make a call to the police, and you leave town with your wife outside of Texas. What a bonehead. Once you've made the decision to steal the goods, you check the goods and make sure you can't be traced. (the fact that Moss said "" I know what a transmittor is"" but doesn't check for one, or even dye pellets inside the money, dude you are a screw up and deserve your fate).4. It just sucked for me. I can't even put my finger on why this flick sucked for me. The cinematography was okay but not that impressive to make up for the story. The acting was okay, but no one in it made me jump up and proclaim ""Dagnabit! That boy deserves an Oscar!"". The best I could say is that this honestly could've been a made-for-TV movie. The violence was minimal. The cattle prod-gun was cool the first time you see it, but then I started thinking ""You're lugging that thing around, and no one notices? You pull a man over in a cop car, but you have no uniform and you have a cattle prod air tank with you, and the yahoos in town just look at you?"" More than anything, this movie made Texans look like dumb hicks. (maybe this explains Bush's background) So those are my main reasons for disliking the film. I've heard loving reviews of the theme of the hunter and the hunted, a killer with no conscience and the sheriff with morality leaking out of his a$$. It's all lies I tell you! It is hyped ""blah"", just like ""The Departed"" was last year. Any talk of Oscar Buzz is undeserved in my opinion. In it's place I would recommend ""Eastern Promises"".","

"okieindian","18 March 2008","I did not read the book and after seeing the movie I never will. I did unfortunately watch the movie and found it to be a typical Hollywood waste of film, talent, money and my time. The hopelessness of Hollywood has nothing to do with real life. If the jerks spent as much time not glorifying the punk, violent, foul mouth, slim ball characters that the ""suits"" in that town seem to admire so much, and made more effort to show life among normal people (Normal in respect to the whores, gangs, etc, etc.)things might be a little brighter... I should have known better than to watch any movie nominated for a Hollywood award... I don't think the idiots there have picked one since Rooster Cogburn that was worth a ****. I don't know about others, but I'm tired of being ripped off with shoddy productions that show a complete lack of imagination, talent, or honesty.","

"jung-8","28 December 2007","Well, I say spoilers but with no plot, a loose story line, random characters, no resolution to story line, saying this review contains spoilers is a compliment I don't want to give this movie. When I went to see this movie I did not know, believe it or not, it was a Coen Brothers film. However after the first scene and the visual of the boot marks all over the floor and I guessed that it was. It left me with the same feeling of the blood stains from the wood chipper in the snow from Fargo.Not the same imagery, mind you, but the same sense of feeling. A sense of something violent and chaotic happened looked at from an obtuse albeit familiar image with contrasting colors of something that shouldn't be there.Next the dialog came about and I knew for sure. This movie is just plain misguided. When directors start to be identified by their techniques they are losing the plot and forgetting what film making is all about. To tell a story and to express ideas, not to showcase their quirks and be identified by them. They should be in the background and not center stage.The Coens, granted in my opinion only, took a step towards the over indulgent David Lynch and a giant leap away from becoming great directors based on their earlier works. The genius of Raising Arizona or Joel's The Hudsucker Proxy is a distant rock of film work casting a giant shadow on this current piece.So many are saying that Javier Bardem's morbid and ""deep"" character is the real gem of the movie and brings originality to a type of role never seen before. Hell, take a look at another Tommy lee film, Batman where he played Two Face. The quirky and annoying Anton Chigurh is simply Two Face in an adult movie and like any bad guy, should not have gotten away.Then there are the random characters being introduced in the movie for no apparent reason. I mean, just what was Woody Harrelson's character in the movie for? Seriously, without dipping into film school hogwash about stereotypes and archetypes of moral choices and bit characters to drive a moral choice. Or the old guy in the wheel chair towards the end? By that time I was just rolling my eyes and getting more confused and upset that I was actually trying to make sense of this non-sequitur story line.Then it hit me. There was no point. There was no reason for this movie at all. It is just one long Coen self back patting cinematic journey and a movie to praise their own, self recognized, film making skills. What Blazing Saddles was to westerns this movie is to their previous works. It is quite ironic, and knowing the Coens deliberate, that it ends with Tommy Lee speaking of dreams. You know that feeling, the sense when you first wake up from a weird dream but in your half asleep mind set the fact that a pink dog was playing Tchaikovsky on the piano while sipping a martini and explaining why hot dogs come in 10 packs while buns come in 8 somehow can relate to your entire life plan and future goals. As you regain your senses and become fully awake you realize that it was only a dream and sometimes a cake is just a cake.Directors should not take center stage and simply let their films speak for them. This movie only speaks about the directors. Those that say this film is genius are still half asleep. When they wake up they also will admit they were stupefied by the Coens and didn't dare to question their ""talent"". Well, I am begging you to indeed question it and see this movie for what it really is: Self indulgent nonsense.Bottom line is that No country for Old Men (even the title is ridiculous and misleading) is a film one can easily skip. When someone comes out and tells you about this film and how great it is, watch them start talking about the Coens and their amazing talent. For if any other director made this heap of trash you would be renting this directly off the shelves as it would never have made the big screen.","

"fraserstewart","22 January 2008","My vote of awful may be a little exaggerated, but I can tell you when this film ended, the audience literally groaned. The story is about some guy who we don't know happening upon a drug deal that went horribly wrong then finding $2 million in cash and taking it.This guy who we find out is called Lewellen (I don't know how to spell it sorry), suddenly grows a conscience and decide to help a dying drug dealer by bringing back water, almost getting himself killed in the process. I honestly as I watched, did not understand why he went back, it was only after we left that my wife explained that he went to take that water to that poor drug dealer.Next we meet our bad guy, a man who has been arrested, escapes and can continue to kill literally dozens of people, even having shoot outs in hotels and main streets, without anyone either caring or phoning the police. This sort of thing must be perfectly normal in Texas, because at one point you have one guy firing a shotgun on the street and no one could care less, let alone phone the police.There's the Sheriff, who's ""trying"" to help the ""good guy"", but couldn't really care. I mean wtf was he doing all day apart from lazing about reading the paper. Apart from anything else he's got a psycho running lose and like 10 dead Mexicans as well as two dead police officers. You'd think he'd be quite busy, but he's really not.Anyway our bad guy is hunting the thief for the money, and then in steps Woody Harrelson who you assume is going to save the day, but gets shot within five minutes. Honestly even after he was shot I thought he was faking it and would come back and help our ""hero"", I honestly couldn't believe it. Then they have both hero and wife murdered off camera, and again you honestly cannot believe that it happened.The worst thing of all though is the ending, you keep thinking that the bad guy will get caught, but no he gets away, after killing like 1 million people, and the film closes with our Sheriff who's done jack anyway talking about some dreams he had. I was literally astounded by this film, it started off well, but just when you were waiting for something to happen, like a showdown between psycho and thief, nothing happened. If you want to waste your money go watch this, otherwise pick something else.","

"modline","15 December 2007","The Coen Brothers have succeeded in making what is possibly the most nihilistic film in the history of cinema, and in doing so they have divided the audience like Moses parting the Red Sea. A lot of people love this film and feel it is one of the greatest ever made, while I'm on the opposite side, thinking the film is too frustrating to be enjoyed.The story, as you may know, revolves around Lleweleyn Moss (Josh Brolin) and, upon his discovery of a crime scene (a drug sale gone horribly wrong), the theft of two million dollars. From the moment he steals the money, Moss is followed by Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a menacing figure who kills anyone who gets in his way. Along the way, we meet Sheriff Ed Thom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who really does nothing to advance the story any, since his character does little to stop the events which unload on screen. In his soliloquies, we learn that he has seen better times than the horror unraveling around him, and that this is no country for old men (thus the title).And that's basically the story in a nutshell. There is virtually no development of characters, no backdrop to show us why Chigurh is involved and so evil, and no involvement of Bell's character. There is a brief appearance of Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), who is hired to track down Moss and Chigurh by someone who obviously was behind the whole drug deal, yet we know nothing about who hired him (even the credits list the character as ""Man who hires Wells""). After Wells fails, the ""Man who hires Wells"" then involves a band of Mexicans to track down Moss, and the story goes off the rails from there.What is even more frustrating is the final quarter of the film, where not only do we not get any further development of character, we get the lead character killed off camera, a scene involving Chigurh and Moss' wife that is not fully realized, an out-of-the-blue car accident which doesn't do anything of any importance, and, yet, another meaningless soliloquy from Jones.I truly do not understand the hype and love surrounding this film. When I saw the film, several people walked out, and there was a groan at the end of the movie and multiple apologies to loved ones from people had brought them to see what was to be the ""movie of the year."" Sure, the movie had great cinematography, great sound, and decent acting (it's a Coen Brother's film, would you expect less?) - the problem lies in the script and the lack of character development. There were some great scenes of tension, especially one involving Chigurh and a gas station owner and the toss of a coin, scenes which truly deserved to be in a better movie.If you're looking for entertainment, the best advice here is to stay far away from this film.","

"Prismark10","16 November 2013","No Country for Old Men is a grandiose, dark, violent Neo-Western thriller from the Coen Brothers.Adapted from a novel by Cormac McCarthy, it stars Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin. Brolin plays an ordinary Joe who whilst out hunting finds a fortune in the aftermath of a drug deal that went bad.This leads to a cat and mouse game involving three men. Brolin who has to evade the relentless hit-man with a bad haircut played by Bardem.He also has to steer clear of Lee Jones, the violence weary veteran sheriff on the hunt for both men knowing that Brolin has bitten off more than he can chew and is in danger.The film is set in Texas of 1980 with a bleak, desert landscape. It is important to note the year, it means Brolin's character is a Vietnam war veteran and the film deals with the purported rise of modern urban violence from the 1970s onwards.McCarty's novel and its adaptation deals with themes of fatalism, conscience and circumstance. The Coen Brothers have dealt with various types of crime genres before in their film careers ranging from Blood Simple, Crimewave, Fargo and Miller's Crossing.In those films there have also been some form of humour even the the dark kind. Here they can pull the themes together in a grander scale as they have the source material that richly delivers. There is much less humour. A journey to bleakness lies for a lot of the participants.It is a combination of a modern western and an urban thriller. Even its 1980s setting with its fashion and style can easily merge with the present day with the presence of four wheel drive vehicles, high rise buildings and automatic weapons.The violence displayed is an important part of the film but some viewers may find this with the grim tone too much for them.","

"Kubris","18 September 2011","IMDb Top 250: 123 If you read the user reviews for this film, the majority are either 1's or 10's. No Country for Old Men is a very love/hate film. You either get it, or it sucks.Following a man who finds $2 million dollars, the man who wants to find him, and the men who want to find the second man, there are many stories told with different frames of mind. A survivalist, a cold blooded killer, and the level-headed lawman who finds it hard living in that day and age. The plot has issues, like how the killer can always find his man. You have to put pieces together and make assumptions.No Country for Old Men is beautiful. Gorgeous long shots of the Texan land are a treat. The first act is breathtaking.I can't lie, it was hard to understand the accents. But the dialogue is clever, with a several laughs, helpful for such a serious film. There's practically no music, and in the odd case it exists you don't even know it.Javier Bardem is terrifying as the psychotic Anton Chiguarh. His spaced-out face and weird hair make his presence unnerving, as well as his iconic cattle gun. Very deserving of his Oscar.Then there's the ending, so spoilers from here. I hated the end, and thus the film, when I first saw it. But now I realize that the point is, like the tagline, there are no clean getaways. Sometimes the bad guys do get away, sometimes the hero does die. That differentiates No Country for Old Men from the vast majority. While the very end is anti-climatic, if you can accept something different, you'll come to appreciate the ending.No Country for Old Men is excellent. A great technical film, beautiful and brutal with great performances and an ending not seen very often awaits. I can't say it's the Best Picture, as I liked There Will Be Blood better, but a very worthy candidate. Have an open mind. 8.3/10","

"thesar-2","23 December 2012","Fargo II: The Country of Old Man could've been the title and that would be cool since it had no continuity with the Cohen's other film.I loved, LOVED, No Country for Old Men. And I'm not even a western kind of guy. Before you squint, this is truly a western.The movie is not modern day. The film deals with multiples of outlaws and firearms. And it's even set in Texas. It contains all an old-west feel with twists of many story lines.This Best Picture winner has so many story lines, in fact, that it's hard to nail a synopsis on it. Suffice to say, it's about a drug deal that went wrong, a man who takes advantage of it, a psycho who's smarter than the average robber, a cop on the way out and so much more. I've already given too much away. But, I will say, this is a gem that appreciates in value and cinematography.Some might have a problem with the finale. Or even all the events leading up to the closing. I am not one of those people. And I will not ruin the ""big surprise"" of someone leaving the movie abruptly, but I actually loved that making this movie all the more original and fun.Highly recommended.

"mim-8","26 February 2008","I'm an absolute fan of the Coen brothers, and think that they represent one of the most imaginative and artistically different movie-making partnerships in the recent decades. The true brilliance of ""The big Lebowski"", ""Barton Fink"", ""Fargo"", ""Miller's crossing"" or their debut ""Blood simple"", shows the way to creativity without compromise. On their latest effort ""No country for old man"" I think they lost that path, the same way as with the misfired ""Raising Arizona"", and compromises with the film industry, which brought them Oscar nominations and subsequent Best picture award, are sadly evident in this film. The Coen seal is there but it's broken in several places and that ruined the originality of their trade mark approach.To begin with everything that is wrong with this film, I have to point out, first and foremost, the gaping plot holes that brought the entire story down. Forget the convenient randomness of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), entering the town of all places, just by the motel where Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is hiding the money, so his transponder can start beeping, the movie holds pretty well up to the point where Moss figures why he is being pinpointed each time by Chigurh, and from that point spirals straight down.First we can't figure why Moss doesn't destroy the transmitter once he realized that this is the reason why he is always found by Chigurh, and especially when he realizes that Chigurh is in the hotel, and that he can pin point the room where Moss is hiding, by following the signal. OK, maybe Moss wants to be found, and have a show down with his pursuer, but than why does he sit right in front of the door, the killer is going to enter, especially knowing that Chigurh turned the hallway lights off. Maybe to have a better shot at him - not likely, and even than, as Moss shoots through the door Chigurh is supposedly standing in front of, just as he blew away the lock with his cattle gun, Chigurh escapes unharmed and is wounded later on in the street. Also, the Woody Harrelson character Carson Wells, is totally undeveloped and surplus in the film. Earlier in the movie we see that he is supposed to be some kind of a specialist in handling extremely dangerous nut jobs like Chigurh, and is paid accordingly, but Chigurgh killed him just as easily as the old man driving the car, at the beginning of the movie!? Than it's never explained how does Wells, find Moss in the Mexican hospital? What tricks and abilities did he use for such intelligence work, being later on, came up behind and shoot as an unsuspecting bozo by Chigurh? Also, back at the high-rise building of the businessman who hired Wells, Chigurh bursts in to find the businessman talking to someone from ""accounting"" and shoots the businessman in the face. How in the world did he, pass through the entire building with cattle gun along with the gas tank and a shotgun? Nobody bothered to show us.But the film really falls apart at the denouement point where we expect a show down between Moss and Chigurh, at the end, where Moss is supposed to send away his wife with the money so he'll be able to freely track Chigurh down. After the scene where Moss is talking to a girl by the pool, it appears like a significant part is cut away from the movie with several key scenes missing! Next, we see sheriff Bell driving along and seeing Mexicans getting out of the motel, Moss being shot,and we don't have a first clue what happened and how? Mexicans supposedly found Moss through his mother in law, but than again, how did they know where to wait for Moss's wife and her mother? How does Chigurh appear in a motel room where Moss have been shoot, and why doesn't he kill sheriff Bell, he's killing everybody else, so why not him? And at the last point where the film might have been partially redeemed, the point where Chigurh gets hit by another car, passing through the intersection, and where he should have been killed by an act of strange, absurd chance, that would bring a twist to the end of this film, he walks away to emptiness from which he came in at the beginning. So that summons it up, lots of empty spaces, (including a pointless Tommy Lee Jones monologue at the very end), in a movie that might have been great if the Coens didn't look for industry seal of approval, and the lack of the same gave their previous films so much charm. 4/10","

"charlie_mc_us","28 November 2007","I am a big Coen brothers fan. I like a lot of their movies, and I love Miller's Crossing and Fargo. But this movie? It just sucked. There's no point to it. The ending is stupid.Yeah the killer is scary as hell. Yeah the dialog is curt and funny, and the hero is brave and resourceful. Yeah his wife is believable, in an unbelievable role. (She played Maggie Smith's maid in Gosford Park -- the small drama in that movie turned on her lovely performance. And lord, what a face.) Should there be a point to a movie? Course not. Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry, and The Vanishing Point are two of my faves. Should there be a story? Course not -- The Sword of Doom is another of my faves. But don't pretend to have a point, then have none.And I think we've found the limit of Tommy Lee Jones' abilities. He was awful talkative for a Texas Sheriff. Not courageous, not worldly, not likable, even.So the Coen brothers make a movie, and it gets into the top 100 at IMDb. Big surprise. When I first saw Fargo in the theater, one viewer laughed for almost the entire movie, and laughed especially hard during the most brutal scenes. As though he got it, and we apparently did not. Well, that is the apparent charm of the Coen brothers for many -- you either get it or you don't -- and this one, I didn't get.Especially the ending. Give me a break.","

"mieriks","19 December 2023","This movie, about violence and mayhem that ensue after a hunter stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and more than two million dollars in cash near the Rio Grande, is a good crime movie!The first half is engaging where we follow the protagonist Llewelyn Moss, but suddenly when he gets killed in the third act, the main focus switches to Ed Tom Bell. It was quite confusing because we don't directly see when Llewelyn gets killed. I have mixed thoughts about this, but I guess the point is how chaotic and random a situation can turn out. Another thing is the ending. It's one of the most abrupt ones I have experienced, which makes the movie feel incomplete. This was a big disappointment to me.My favorite element is obviously the exceptional antagonist Anton Chigurh. He's cold, intolerant and purposeful, and I love every scene with him. The movie also has an appealing script, cinematography and locations that create an authentic feeling, but I really miss some music and atmosphere because it felt like a very quiet and slow movie. Therefore, the movie could feel a little boring sometimes, at least when we didn't follow Llewelyn nor Anton. So overall, I think the movie has room for improvements, but it's still enjoyable.This is a gripping crime thriller that delivers a compelling narrative of violence and chaos. Its exceptional antagonist, Anton, and the authenticity of its setting are its strengths, while the abrupt ending and lack of music can be minor drawbacks.","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","30 October 2021","'No Country For Old Men (2007)' has a tangible grit to it; you can almost feel the very fabric of the film itself. It's a calm and methodical meditation on the changing nature of both crime itself and the world at large (with a focus on America, in particular). It maintains its slow pace even during its bluntly violent action sequences, which are often genuinely intense. The piece is surprisingly suspenseful, providing proper thrills alongside its pseudo philosophical pondering. It doesn't spoon-feed you anything; you have to work to understand its plot and, even, characters, which are both relatively elusive and purposefully amoral. The flick makes no judgements on its players, even though some are truly despicable, and it doesn't provide easy explanations or motivations for some of their actions. This makes for an engaging experience that encourages rather deep thinking. The movie isn't as straightforward as its pretty by-the-numbers set-up would suggest. It undercuts itself at, arguably, its most important moment, subverting expectation with an unconventional yet shockingly effective final third. It really is brilliant. The film feels substantial, a resonant commentary on the ever-evolving yet always cyclical nature of violence and the pure randomness of fate. It stays with you for quite a while after it's over, both providing in-the-moment excitement and provoking retroactive reflection. It's a confident and considered affair right from the start. It's wonderful. 9/10.","

"Mr-Fusion","17 April 2014","It doesn't tend to come up when I think of crime movies, but ""No Country for Old Men"" is a great one. It's got that slow and methodical predator-stalking-his-prey tempo, and the movie's populated with some great characters. Anton Chigurh is surely one of the creepiest bad guys I've ever laid eyes on (the cattle gun is novel, and the sound of that shotgun!); Bardem ratchets the creepiness of that guy to unbelievable heights. Conversely, Brolin's outlaw has got to be one of the dumbest. He proves himself a wily criminal, but drug money always has someone coming for it. Not bright.But even in a movie full of well-drawn characters, Tommy Lee Jones is still the highlight for me. He vividly brings to life the sardonic world-weary lawman and I found myself looking forward to his next scene and hearing his dialogue. Dude's just got that gift. Harrelson's equally gifted here. But I was also floored on a technical level. There's great atmosphere; those arid deserts are not a place I want to find myself lost in (that howling wind is its own brand of unnerving). But just how much of this movie played out with no score. The sound design here is amazing; more often than not, it's just he background noise of a ticking clock, beeping transponder or footsteps providing us with any sound at all. It's haunting, really.7/10","

It's not entirely clear why the Coen Brothers made all the decisions they did but, much like their other works, this movie makes you believe that there is purpose behind every line, every shot, and every edit. The first time I saw this film, I was frustrated with how it ended. I still am, but to a lesser degree now, because the slow & methodical journey this drama provides is more important than the destination. Plus, Anton Chigurh is truly terrifying. It's incredible how suspenseful this film is without a score and without much dialogue.","

The third act has no resolution, no climax, no tying up of threads, no questions answered, no drama, no action, no character-arc completion, just... nothing. It's made all the more terrible by the fact that the first two acts are very well done and worth watching. For almost two hours we are led on an intelligent, tense cat and mouse chase, then suddenly - POOF, the Coen brothers make all the good stuff go away in a single moment. The viewer is left thinking two things: ""what the F**K?"" and ""I was enjoying that until..."" It's a bit like lighting the fuse on a really big firework, standing back - tense with anticipation - watching it sail up into the air and then... it fizzles into the night sky without so much as a sound. A dud. A complete and utter dud.You don't need any spoiler alerts here as there is no story resolution. Aside from one character, you actually aren't even told what happens to any of the other people you just invested two hours in. Oh, and by the way, don't follow that bag of money, because you never even find out who gets it. Don't follow that good guy vs. bad guy plot line, because neither of them ever confront the other - oh except on a telephone call about two thirds of the way in. Don't follow that... Oh wait, there aren't any other subplots to follow anyway.I suppose I can't entirely blame the Coens as I'm aware this came from a novel. I haven't read the novel but if it ends as unsatisfyingly as the movie did then this man has no business calling himself a storyteller.","

"tieman64","18 January 2008","""Lebowski"" began with a tumbleweed blowing across a desert. It went where the wind took it, its fate entirely dependent on how the breeze blows. The essence of film noir is in this idea of cosmic (in)determinism, our everyman heroes trapped in a noir plot, buffeted by chance, hopelessly battling against a conspiratorial, wholly indifferent universe.With ""Lebowski"" the Coens transplanted noir fate to the life of a lazy bum. Whilst someone like Sarah Connor battles fate in ""The Terminator"", or Bogart battles his way out of a cosmically convoluted plot in ""The Big Sleep"", Jeffery Lebowski was content to simply lets it all wash over him. All these variables, they don't bother him. He's a tumbleweed in a noir web, practising inaction, pacifism and happy acceptance. In short, he's just too damn lazy to care about the events revolving all around him. The Dude just abides. ""No Country"" also begins with a barren dessert, and also rehashes themes found in virtually every Coen flick. Here, a guy called Llewelyn Moss stumbles across a bag of money. He takes it, leaving behind a bleeding gang member. Later that night he feels guilty and decides to take a bottle of water out to the wounded man. Ironically, it's this act of kindness which gets Moss in trouble. The rest of the film is one long cat and mouse chase sequence, akin to ""The Terminator"", in which Moss runs from a psychopathic killer called Chigurh. Like ""The Terminator"", Chigurh symbolises the inevitability of death (or rather, the cold, indifferent weight of the universe). Death being that one fate which we are all resigned to. Observe how Chigurh kills his prey with a cattle gun, urging them to ""be still"" whilst he blows off their heads. This is mirrored to Moss firing at antelope with his hunting rifle, urging them to ""be still"" before he shoots. Both hunter and hunted are killers, but only one is successful. Moss misses his antelope. The notion of a cattle gun also dehumanises Chigurh's prey. To Chigurh, Man is a mere animal which he has no moral qualms slaughtering.The film ends with a Sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) no longer wanting to be part of this ugly world of men. To do so, he says, would put his soul at hazard. His answer is to retire. To stop trying, a defeatist stance which runs across the Coen's filmography (Barton Fink mocks socially conscious artists, all their films express the futility of planning and ""A Serious Man"" finds futility even in serious thought etc). A clock ticks away during this scene. The clock is a cinematic symbol long linked with death (it's also present when Chigurh kills the wife). And yet, though the clock is present throughout the scene, a green tree looms over the Sheriff's shoulder. This symbolic Tree of Life appeared earlier in the film as a dead Mexican's other tree of choice. Dual choices appear throughout the film. Two options, two rooms, two trees etc.The Sheriff's then articulates two dreams. The first dream is ""all about money"". That dream is the film we've just witnessed, and conveys the Sheriff's belief that he's failed as a law enforcer. The second dream is about his father lighting a fire in the night to starve off the cold. This is symbolic of man fending off nature by providing his own light.""No Country"" is a slick and stylish film, with enough mysticism to make it feel grand, but at it's core it's no different to any other noir essays on determinism. The Coens have their Sheriff do the same thing as every tragic noir hero, embracing defeatism and giving up trying. While ""The Lebowski"" was an original take on noir, ""No Country"" seems content to just wallow in the bleakness. Which is fine. But it makes you frustrated that the Coens don't do or try something more. Thematically the film comes across as no more than Clint Eastwood's ""High Plains Drifter"" or ""PaleRider"", so what we're responding to is, as always, only that Coen brothers style.Compare this to some modern neo-noirs like ""Femme Fatale"" and the ""Terminator"" movies, both of which actively challenge this idea of noir fate (though both are still mostly formalist games rather than genuine, socially progressive noirs). Yes, man is subject to chance, but De Palma's film argues that art empowers man, imbuing him with godhood, whilst Cameron's argues that the future can be dependent on us, that man can conquer his own mistakes (genetic, technological etc).So the problem with ""No Country"" is that it isn't sincere as a film dealing with the bleakness. It's a kind of trite existentialism. The Coens are never sincere as artists and only clever as stylists. Here they don't really deal with the darkness, it is merely an excuse to serve up Gothic violence.Incidentally, ""No Country's"" climax presents the flip-side to ""Fargo's"". Both Jerry Lundegaard and Llewelyn Moss meet their dooms at a motel. At this point the Coens ditch their elegant cameras and go for shaky, pseudo-documentary realism. Afterwards, in both films, a Sheriff comments on the ""darkness"" of the world. In ""Fargo"", Frances McDormand comments on Jerry's doom, whilst here, Tommy Lee Jones comments on Moss' death. Frances ultimately has a very positive, snuggly view of the world, whilst Tommy has a more negative, fatalistic view. Significantly, Frances character, like all successful Coen heroes, is a bit of a short sighted idiot. Throughout the Coen's filmography, it's the Forrest Gumps of the world who escape Chigurh. 8/10 – Slick, stylish, superficial.","

"PWNYCNY","14 December 2007","There is a saying: a movie is only as good as its ending, which makes this movie not bad, but certainly not that good. It's as if the creators of this movie had decided that they would try to out-do The Mist for the worst ending of an otherwise interesting movie for the year 2007. Also, this movie brings to mind another good movie, The Last King of Scotland, in that how ""Scotland"" shows how a murdering tyrannical dictator isn't such a bad guy, ""No Country"" tries to make the same case for a serial murderer who systematically murders only bad guys. I guess tyrannical dictators and serial killers have their stories too. When trying to dramatize the behavior of seriously mentally deranged persons, such as serial killers, Hollywood sometimes does a good job. Case in point: Taxi Driver, which offers a compelling story about a troubled young man who kills. In Cold Blood is another excellent movie of that genre. This movie does not even come close to those movies in terms of quality or storytelling. Tommy Lee Jones is lost in this movie. He is entirely miscast. The actor who plays the main protagonist, the psychopath who goes around killing, gives a great performance as long as he does not talk, which is not his fault because the dialog is weak. Nevertheles, the movie does have its fascinating features and is watchable but with one caveat: be prepared for is just one weak ending. One other point: This movie portrays law enforcement has being easily duped and completely ineffective despite the presence of massive evidence that provides an almost inexhaustible supply of solid leads. What's even more ridiculous is the portrayal of the sheriff as being practically the only law enforcement agent involved in this case when in reality such a high-profile case, involving multiple murders of foreign nationals along or near a border, would have a virtual army of federal, state, county and local officials assigned to it. They'd being practically fighting each other over who would have final jurisdictional authority. But these kind of facts do not necessarily make for good fiction, so there's one sheriff - that's it - trying to deal with a serial killer, and this sheriff is planning to retire! Can you blame him? Yeah ... right. Duh. Here's another take on this movie. Maybe this movie is Hollywood's way of portraying the plight of the seriously mentally ill with violent dispositions. Remember, friends, this is Hollywood that we're talking about, not some mental health organization, and if Hollywood thinks something will sell, it will play it up to the hilt. No subject, no matter how sensitive, is off limits, and it seems that with this movie, Hollywood has decided that ""mental illness"" is in. Of course, once Hollywood gets a hold of the subject the powers-that-be, using literary license, will transform that subject into something that is almost totally unrecognizable from the original subject. In the case of ""mental illness"", Hollywood portrays it as something sinister, uncontrollable and a threat to society. Now if this sells, then who's to complain? Then again, it may be appropriate if the movie includes this proviso: ""Any depictions of mental illness in this movie may not conform with actual facts.""","

"r96sk","13 July 2022","I can't say I view this one positively. I clearly don't get it, which I'm fine with.I'm all for films that don't play it so straight that it's predictable, but at the same time I'm rarely a fan of films that are so full of themselves to end in such a derisory way. Listen, that's probably harsh as it is still a good flick no doubt, but 'No Country for Old Men' is highly unsatisfactory and highly uninspiring for me.I will say that I have no issues with the cast whatsoever, they are all fantastic. Javier Bardem is awesome, easily the star, and Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Woody Harrelson are all top value. Kelly Macdonald and Garret Dillahunt are also involved, I like them too. Stephen Root, Mr. 'L for Love' himself, as well. Away from the onscreen bunch, the cinematography is superb.It's the story. I didn't get what I wanted from it, at all. All the ingredients are there for a 10/10 film, that's the level I was expecting it to reach based on the opening half or so. The second half though... super disappointing! So many underwhelming choices. Such a waste of a strong cast... 'The Counselor'-esque. Bardem is also in that, sorry my dude!The fact I'm still giving this what I consider to be a positive rating shows how much the conclusion frustrated me. This had top tier written all over it but it somehow messed it up as it went by... and I'm not usually one to dig out a film's ending.In my defence, even some reviews (many, in fact) from people who love the film mention that the ending isn't perfect so I guess it just comes down to how the final moments sit with you. For me, evidently not good!","

He is a horror villain.The contrast they uses where most of the scenes have a dark shadow to the mix it look so distinct and good and all the shooting when people get shots look so gory and disgusting in the best possible way it gives it a really big punch shots happens.And the way the characters are a few words makes it almost a silent movie where you have to judge it by the characters movement and the few lines they say it is so good and makes it so more tense.The actors did an amazing job and was totally believable I didn't not happen to find a logic floor anything like that. It was tossed a really good written and acted movie and especially the antagonist villain.","

"Mustang92","15 November 2008","In brief, the Coen Brothers are among the most overrated filmmakers alive today. Nearly every single movie they make, contains no real ending or payoff for the audience. (Exception: ""Fargo"") No, I'm not talking about a happy ending or one that is typical Hollywood. I'm talking about no ending.Their stories usually start out well, but their strengths as filmmakers are not in the actual storytelling, or script. It's in their style and the ""look"" of their movies. But all style and no substance is not great film-making. Which was obvious from their first highly overrated movie, ""Blood Simple."" This movie typifies that. As another reviewer here wrote, this is a glorified B movie, with self-indulgent pretentiousness. I've said this since at least ""Barton Fink"" but probably even before then: The Coen Brothers are masturbatory filmmakers. They make movies for themselves, what pleases them, and don't give a crap about their audiences. It's clear they don't care whether we have ""cartharsis,"" or closure at the end of their movies. And there frequently are no arcs in their characters, or the story itself.In this movie, the killer remains the killer... he never changes. The Josh Brolin character never changes... he just runs till he's killed. The Sheriff never changes... he's a philosophically ""sad"" guy who decides to retire after seeing all the blood and mayhem during the story. No arc for this guy.I never read the book, so I don't know if the story is ""flawed"" in the first place. But this movie is very flawed, and it's a total joke that it won an Oscar for Best Picture. This is ludicrous. (Probably what happened was the other nominated films split votes, so this one squeaked to the win.)Besides no arcs, here are some more flaws: We never learn or understand who the Mexicans are, or why they're chasing the money. Presumably there are 2 factions of Mexicans, one buying and one selling the drugs, when the deal went down. We learn that an Anglo businessman is behind something here (either the buyer or seller, probably the buyer), but he hires Woody Harrelson to track down the money. So why is there a contingent of Mexicans after the money too? Makes no sense.The drugs also disappear from the flatbed truck at some point, so where do they go? Who got them? If the Mexicans, then why would they still be after the money? And if the Anglo businessman got them (via his 2 business guys that Javier Bardem kills), then why is HE after the money?Ludicrous, totally ludicrous. The story makes no real sense. Furthermore, who is Javier Bardem? And why is he after the money? How does he even know about the money? Who hired him, if anyone? You want story logic, don't expect it from this movie!Speaking of no story logic, gotta mention this last one, the scene between Bardem and Harrelson in the hotel. So Bardem is after the money, yet he shows up to speak to Harrelson (and eventually kill him). Why? He says he knows where Brolin is, so why doesn't he just go to where Brolin is? By not doing so, Brolin then gets away. Sure, Bardem is a psychopathic killer -- after all, everyone says so -- but only in his pursuit of the money. He doesn't go out of his way to kill people... only in pursuing the money. Yet he does go out of his way here, with the Harrelson character. Lame lame lame. What a horrible story this was.You want to see a good thriller? Rent something else. You want to see a ""cool"" style with good cinematography, but don't care about story AT ALL? Then this will do.","

Meanwhile the owners of the money assign the psychopath killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) to chase Moss following the transponder in the wallet and leaving a trail of murders. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), from the third generation of a family of men-of-law, investigates the crimes while questions the momentum of violence of his country.""No Country for Old Men"" is a pretentious and overrated movie of Ethan and Joel Cohen. The authors blended the old story lines of Sam Raimi's ""A Simple Plan"" with Robert Harmon's ""The Hitcher"" plus some cheap philosophy to write this story. The result is not bad at all, with good performances and an unrecognizable Javier Bardem in the role of a psychopath killer. Unfortunately the story fails with its inconclusive conclusion. Surprisingly this average movie is ranked Top 250 # 79 in IMDb. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Onde os Fracos Não Tem Vez"" (""Where the Weaks do not Have Chance"")","

The man exuded controlled evil, and I found myself not breathing when he came onto screen, yet couldn't take my eyes from him - a truly mesmerising presence.Tommy Lee Jones turns in a belter of a performance, and mention should also be made of Kelly MacDonald who nails a faultless Texan accent alongside a multi-layered performance (despite the paucity of her screen time).Beautifully shot, as you would expect, and with some (welcome) moments of humour amongst the gore, this is a very very fine film. Miss it at your peril, because when those little golden men are being handed out next year in LA, I predict a lot of them will be going to this film. A belter.","

"zardoz-13","23 July 2009","""O' Brother, Where Art Thou"" co-directors Joel and Ethan Coen have created another classic melodrama with their quasi-western, road trip crime epic ""No Country for Old Men"" about an inexorable killer and his quest to recover millions in illicit drug money. This art-house saga is a simple, but powerful tale that involves four primary characters and a host of supporting characters. Ostensibly, the narrator, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, spends most of his time dwelling on the psychology of the characters as well as the changing times. ""No Country for Old Men"" isn't your ordinary shoot'em up with cut and dried heroes and villains. The Coens have adapted the Cormac McCarthy novel and retained its pervasive sense of irony. Indeed, the moral universe of ""No Country"" is skewered because the villain survives, the protagonist dies, and the sheriff is so scared that he quits his job. Paid killer Anton Chigurh embodies the essence of pure evil. Despite the fact that he is a flesh & blood character, Chigurh could send shivers up the Terminator's spine because he never gives up. Although the Coens may not realize it, Chigurh resembles another inexorable killer, the Lee Van Cleef gunman called 'Angel Eyes' in director Sergio Leone's ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" Like 'Angel Eyes,' Chigurh always finishes the job no matter what the consequences.The action opens with a sheriff's deputy arresting Chigurh (Javier Bardem of ""Collateral"") and taking him in hand cuffs back to the jail. The unsuspecting deputy leaves the cuffed Chigurh sitting in a chair behind him while he calls up the sheriff and talks about the unusual weapon that Chigurh uses to kill people. At the end of the conversation with the sheriff, the deputy promises his boss that ""he has everything under control."" Meanwhile, behind him, Chigurh has slid his cuffed wrists up under his thighs so that he can hold his hands in front of himself. Immediately, he attacks the deputy and they leave many boot heel scuff marks on the floor while they struggle. Chigurh kills the deputy, confiscates a police cruiser, takes his peculiar weapon that consists of a slim canister, a hose, and a firing mechanism and pulls over a motorist, kills him with this odd weapon and steals his car. Later, at a Texaco gas station, Chigurh takes umbrage when the attendant asks him about the weather. This is quite a chilling scene as Chigurh stares at the attendant with his opaque eyes and forces him to play a game that involves flipping a coin. The attendant–like many characters–isn't the brightest bulb in the factory and he can never get Chigurh to spell out the stakes riding on the coin flip.The ostensible protagonist, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin of ""American Gangster""), is hunting deer antelope in the desert and wounds one. He sets out to track down the wounded animal and comes across a scene straight out of Hell, a circle of trucks in the middle of nowhere and bullet-riddled bodies strewn about them with a dead dog. Earlier, Moss saw a wounded pit bull limping in the high weeds. He finds one Mexican still alive but bleeding to death. Eventually, Moss figures out that one Mexican got away and he follows him to a ridge clad with two trees and finds the man dead with a satchel and a shiny automatic pistol. When Moss returns home to his trailer, his wife Carla Jean (Kelly MacDonald of ""Trainspotting"") watching television. She inquires about the pistol but Moss brushes off all questions and threatens to take her to bed and have sex with her. She snorts derisively and quips, ""That'll be the day."" Later that night, Moss decides to return to the scene of the shooting because his conscience has gotten to him about the sole survivor that he found. No sooner has he set foot on the scene that some Mexicans wheel up in a truck, slash his tires, pursue him and take shots at him. Moss dives into a river and the Mexicans dispatch a tenacious pit bull dog that leaps into the river and swims after him. Moss barely gets out of the river and clears his pistol before the dog lunges at him and he guns it down. You don't often see dogs die in modern-day movies.Chigurh arrives on the scene with two other men later on, studies the site, shoots them and sets out to find the stolen money. ""No Country"" depicts his pursuit of Moss. These two guys are pretty obstinate characters. Neither one of them gives up, but Moss has no idea about the lengths to which Chigurh is committed to go. Moss sends Carla Jean off to Odessa, Texas, to be with her mother while he heads off in a different direction. At the same time, Sheriff Ed Tom and his deputy investigate the killings and Ed Tom is clearly shaken by what he sees of this killer. In a border town, Moss and Chigurh shoot it out in the street after Chigurh storms the hotel where Moss had holed up and kills the night clerk. He wounds Moss, but Moss wounds him, too. Chigurh stages a car fire in front of a pharmacy to get the medical supplies to tend to his wounds, while Moss walks across the border at night and winds up in a Mexican hospital where he recuperates.""No Country for Old Men"" is a chilling tale of crime in the southwest about a killer who will stop at nothing to complete his mission. Nevertheless, this isn't an action shoot'em up clever dialogue. Nothing goes as it should in a regular crime melodrama. Good loses in the long run and evil wins out in the end. This movie justifiably received four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Bardem netted the Best Supporting Oscar for his killer.","

"majic-5","23 November 2007","To call this film an elegy to a simpler, more civilized society, would be, well, too civilized. If you want a good in-depth analysis of the nihilistic message of this film, read this review: http://tinyurl.com/33eer8 The time for this movie (and the recent book it was based on) was 30 years ago. Then, it would have been an insightful social commentary. Anyone paying attention to the world since that time has received the director's message loud and clear, over and over, just by watching or reading the news. It's clear that the world has become a more savage place, that individual efforts to resist the downward spiral are futile. To shoot at, stomp on, and rip up the bloody corpse of a civilized society is completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the conversation.As entertainment, the film fails, too. There are no real people in this film, only stock types: the naive, greedy, sap, the overmatched lawman, the unstoppable bad guy, the sensible western wife, the scummy Mexican jackals. There is no one to engage with, sympathize with, or be terrified of, because everyone in the movie is just a caricature. The CG character of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings had more substance than the hyperviolent hit man in this flick.As a result, crackerbarrel philosophy is passed off as sage insight, and cruel violence is passed off as a good time. At least Pulp Fiction, this movie's closest cousin, had wit and characterization. The fawning reception of this movie by critics and moviegoers angers and baffles me.","

Not only was it not very good, it was much worse than my worst expectations.I had expected a lot of brutal violence and it delivered on that point. What I hadn't expected was that it was going to be so mindlessly boring.There is only a minimal plot. The characters are all one-dimensional and nobody is likable. There are multiple plot holes, some which defy all logic.

"ssih","19 February 2008","Like others have said, I was swayed by the ultra-high rating this garnered. It stars about 300 actors that I respect, and the Coen Bros - well, say no more!! But when it was all over, my wife and I were asking ourselves if our time might have been better spent re-grouting the bathroom tile.The four stars I gave it were primarily due to Tommy Lee Jones, who does a better job on his worst day (i.e., this film) than on most actors' best. He's done this role several times before, and simply added a ""burnt-out and tired"" twist to it. Some of the down-home good ol' boy banter was fun.But aside from that...I don't mind letting reality slide if I'm watching movies like Star Trek, or Dracula, but I got the impression that this wasn't intended to be based on the supernatural. What was this gas tank that the murderer was carrying around? It managed to blow holes through deadbolts without his hand twitching. I'm no physicist, but most people should have a vague grasp of the ""equal and opposite reaction"" principle.And while I understand that he had that nifty Radio Shack transponder, it did nothing but beep. But somehow it managed to bring him right to the correct hotel. And even without the transponder, he magically divined that Llewelyn Moss went to Mexico.Woody Harrelson shared the same clairvoyance, as he was able to walk to where Moss tossed the money and figure out where he threw it. Agent Fox Mulder would have been impressed.And as clever as Llewelyn Moss was, you'd think that once he found the transponder in the money, he might - you know - toss it out the window? Maybe on top of a moving truck? Nah - that would be cheating. And when the killer is standing on the other side of the door, he cleverly remains directly in the obvious line of fire. The only thing he didn't do was to yell, ""I'm right here!"" I can only explain all of the high ratings on the fact that the Coen Brothers did the film, and they obviously can't do any wrong. If I didn't like the movie, it must be that I didn't understand it, and I'll be damned if I'll let the world know that I don't have the necessary depth to appreciate this obvious masterpiece.","

"Chrysanthepop","4 March 2008","'No Country for Old Men' does stay true to the tagline. We see midway through the film when Moss pays 500 dollar to buy a jacket to 'get away'. We see later on that Chigurh pays a large sum to a boy for his shirt after a possibly fatal accident. Being a fan of the Coens's movies, I was looking forward to this one. 'No Country for Old Men' is one of the darkest and most visceral films of the Coen brothers. One could argue that it has a lot more gore than 'Fargo'. However, this is no slasher flick with pointless excessive violence. It sticks to the main story without too many deviations (though some characters are pointless e.g. Carson Wells). It's got the Coen humour (which I very much enjoy) but I find it hard to compare to their other works. The use of camera-work and lack of colour and background score is effective. Actually it's pretty much got the ingredients of a great Coen movie. There are some brilliant performances. Javier Bardem is really menacing as Chigurh. The actor totally owns that character. I wonder why his role was recognized as supporting when the plot pretty much revolved around him. Kelly MacDonald brings a fresh contribution. The actress makes you forget her British origin and does full justice to the Texan Carla Jean Moss. Josh Brolin too gets a meaty role and the actor does an adequate job. Sadly, Tommy Lee Jones fails to impress and Woody Harrelson barely has a role of substance. Some of the dialogues are repetitive. To put it in one sentence, 'No Country for Old Men' is a dark unconventional movie about violence, murder, greed, escape, and destiny.","

"Turfseer","22 February 2008","More semi-entertaining hokum from the Coen Brothers. It's quite curious that the mass killings by a sophisticated serial killer only garners the attention of one hick small-town sheriff and his staff. What happened to the FBI? Yes the DEA is mentioned but we never see them. What happened to all the media coverage? The serial killers picture would probably have made the national news and he should have been on the FBI's 10 most wanted list but we see none of that. Yes I know it's supposed to be 1980 but still the pursuit of this fugitive would have been a big story. The reason why the Coens don't show that is because they've created a totally unrealistic character that exists totally in their specious imagination. In real life there would have been hundreds of law enforcement agents tracking this guy but we never get a sense of that in this laughable scenario.Although the story is supposed to be 25 years before our own time, the killer seems more like a specially trained Matt Damon CIA agent straight out of the Bourne Identity. He's so good that he knows how to create the perfect diversion to obtain the proper drugs and has the medical training to remove a bullet from his leg. He almost seems like a superman, gunning down anyone who comes into his path without a whimper from law enforcement. What's more he always seems to know how to find anybody he plans on eliminating. We also never completely understand his motives for killing the many innocent people he comes across. Is he simply a thrill killer who enjoys terrorizing the public at large? We never really learn anything about his past history. Usually there's a discussion amongst law enforcement officials detailing a killer's background--we never get a sense of that during this movie.Just as we must have a Superman for an antagonist, we must also have a Superman for a protagonist. Josh Brolin, a welder who lives in a trailer park, seems like the perfect match for the evil Chigurh. Brolin's 'Llewelyn Moss' shows absolutely no fear taking $2 million from Mexicans, mostly all massacred at a crime scene. But suddenly, he has a pang of conscience which propels him back to the crime scene with a gallon of water to help one of the dying drug dealers. The average person would have called the police had they come upon such a scene; if he was amoral (as he is initially depicted), then he certainly wouldn't have been so stupid to return to the scene and put himself in such jeopardy. When he does return to the scene of the slaughter, suddenly he's a superman again, eluding a truck full of drug dealers shooting at him, swimming in the rapids and fending off a vicious dog who swims after him in the river. Then he devises this incredible plan where he stuffs the $2 million bucks in a ventilator shaft at the motel, has the drug dealers occupy his motel room (didn't they also have a transponder and would have discovered the bag in the shaft?) and has the serial killer eliminate the drug dealers and evades being eliminated himself.Meanwhile, Tommie Lee Jones, our hick sheriff as well as all the other stereotypical Texans depicted in this film, seem powerless against this maniacal killer. One gets the impression that just about all ordinary folk who lived in the South in 1980 are a bunch of dumb yokels. To be fair, the Coens also depict their hired killers as dumb yokels too. Woody Harrelson suddenly comes out of nowhere, is presented as some fantastic hired killer who's going to track down the serial killer and within half an hour, ends up the killer's hostage in a hotel room and is blown away (not before however he just happens to be strolling along the bridge near the US-Mexican Border and just happens to glance downward and discovers the bag full of money! What a coincidence!)The Coens' view of life is basically nihilistic and pessimistic. What they're saying here is that evil is stronger than those with a moral compass and that we live in a universe where we have no control over random events (even the serial killer is almost killed himself in a random car accident at the end of the film). Sure, bad things sometimes happen to good people but those who have a moral purpose in this world are not ineffectual pushovers (as depicted by a character like the Sheriff who basically concedes that he will be the serial killer's next victim and that he is powerless to stop him). When the deck is stacked as it is here in this movie, evil is the clear winner. But in reality, it's not so easy for the bad guys to walk away without being brought to the bar of justice. The Coens are trying to say that we are only observers here--that sometimes men are powerless in the face of evil. There is nothing profound about their observations; and their strategy is dishonest because their antagonist is way too smart for his opponents. When the opponents are nothing but a bunch of stereotypical hicks and losers of every stripe, it's easy to understand why the bad guy walks away with nothing more than a broken arm carefully held in place by a self-constructed sling.","

"Blue-Grotto","5 November 2017","""You can't help but wonder how the old timers would operate in these times,"" narrates Sheriff Ed in thick and alluring southwestern drawl. We soon find out exactly what he means by ""these times."" Llewelyn is hunting in a remote and arid grassland, stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong and manages to get away with a bundle of cash. While Llewelyn covers his tracks, keeps his mouth shut and is smart, tough and resourceful, he may not be prepared for what is coming for him in the form of tracker Anton Chigurh. A person without empathy is more dangerous than a coward, and Chigurh is cold, cruel, relentless and methodical. He figures out not just where people are, but where they will be. As Chigurh pursues Llewelyn, others are close behind including Sheriff Ed, a drug cartel, other trackers and Llewelyn's girlfriend, only a few of whom are cut out for this game of cat and mouse.Ten years after the release of the film and it is well understood how it made or sealed the careers of Javier Bardem (Chigurh), Josh Brolin (Llewelyn), Tommy Lee Jones (Ed) and not least of all the Coens who are some of the best directors in the business. Here the Coens are firing on all cylinders. The film is complex, thrilling and multi-layered. It is full of great lines. Its occasional extreme brutality is offset with wit, charm and humor. Adding to the compelling characters are amazing performances by Jones, Bardem and Brolin. They are perfectly cast. The voice of Jones alone is authentic and enthralling. Bardem is truly chilling. He speaks, moves and acts like a ghost. There are beautiful shots of the southwestern landscape in the morning light and intriguing close-ups of the characters. There is delight even in little details; a coin flip, a drink of milk, a cat and the banter of minor characters. Such attention to detail is a mark of the brilliance of the Coens. The film is set in the 1970s and is based on a story by Cormac McCarthy. This is one of my favorite films (top 20) of all time.","

"lastliberal","28 January 2008","West Texas is a perfect setting for a movie like this -- no trees, just desolate land for miles around. The chicken farmer (Richard Jackson) was from Alpine -a place in the middle of nowhere with a long long stretch of road that literally - I kid you not - has turkey buzzards on the fence posts along the way. Annie Proulx (Brokeback Mountain) described it perfectly in her 2002 book, ""That Old Ace in the Hole."" I've been gone from there for five years, but it hadn't changed much from the 1980 setting in the film, an I suspect it hasn't changed much more.Llewelyn Moss, played brilliantly by Josh Brolin (Grindhouse, Hollow Man) thought he hit the jackpot. But, he didn't account for Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Chigurh was methodical, intelligent and psychotic. He is the human equivalent of the terminator robot after John Conner. Those who believe in souls would not say that Chigurg has one.Tommy Lee Jones (The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, U.S. Marshals) is a tired sheriff that comes from a long line of lawmen. He knows that he is no match for Chigurg. It's not Richard Kimble or Mark Sheridan he's chasing, but a man who has no match.The dialog is dry and things are not always explained. There is constant tension knowing what may lie on the other side of the door.Jones' buddy Ellis had it down: Whatcha got ain't nothing new. ""This country's hard on people, you can't stop what's coming, it ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity."" Dying with your boots on is still dying.","

"samkan","23 March 2008","Be suspicious of a few negative reviews sticking out among overwhelmingly favorable ones; i.e., is this person trying to show how smart he/she is? Is he/she trying to attract attention? I like the Cohen brothers' movies and am generally optimistic about films. I didn't care for NCFOM.FARGO was excellent in part because of the banal evil contrasted against the equally matter-of-fact goodness of McDormand's family, friends, etc. Good overcame evil without fanfare, moralizing or -for that matter- very much thought. Further contrast was provided by Macy and Buscemi's characters, who being lost somewhere south of good but north of pure evil, became doomed.Watching NCFOM, I gathered in the meaning of Tommy Lee Jones opening narrative which laid out the good v. evil motif (if a bit explicitly). Thereafter the theme was supported by little more than cop banter until the end of the film when we get two lengthy and embarrassingly moralizing speeches from the sheriff's friend and family. I'm no intellectual. I can appreciate a movie strictly for style (MULHOLLAND DRIVE) with uneven style (DOGMA) or lacking traditional or cohesive narrative (tons of them). If that's what you set out to do, however, don't paint your film so tediously! Why provide such detailed plot? Why am I fed precious moments of Brolin's fashioning a hook to retrieve the money bag? Why waste minutes teaching us how to self-treat a shotgun injury or where to hide a handgun under a trailer? What am I to do with these details? Why infuse so much deadpan humor; e.g., mother-in-law's back seat rant and Bardem's deadpan monster (this is a relatively juvenile device,see the TERMINATOR). What am I to make of a Texas town entertaining dozens of gunshots and a car crash in the middle of the night with all the townsfolk remaining asleep? If I'm supposed to feel remorse for the futility of goodness I need to see goodness at least FACE the evil. Presently I won't visit West Texas because the lawmen are sipping coffee and the people are zombies.The Cohen brothers are far better film makers than; e.g., Quentin Tarentino, but I saw a parallel with the hype for PULP FICTION, which I abhorred. I'd read a ton of reviews for each movie. Yet none of the reviews where able to tell me, besides the plot itself, WHY the movie was good or what it was supposed to convey. In other words, all the reviews were gushers of praise by apparently hypnotized viewers. I read Ebert's review after I watched NCFOM. Roger's our finest movie critic and a true gentleman. He has obviously read McCarthy and I have not. Usually after reading an Ebert review I realize how ignorant I am, Usually he points out specific things I didn't pick up or of which I am just unaware. I didn't feel that way this time. NCFOM just did not do it for me.","

"buckethead66","25 November 2007","No Country for Old Men had a great storyline, character development, acting, and cinematography, and still managed to disappoint me greatly with its crappy anticlimactic ending.What is the purpose of suspense? I couldn't wait to see how the three main characters would interact when they inevitably met. But the Coens yank the rug out from under the audience by suddenly wiping out the protagonist 75% of the way through the movie. Why waste so much time building Llewelyn Moss'(Brolin's) character and emphasizing his resourcefulness if you're going to kill him off so abruptly with no explanation? There's easily an entire scene missing. Fine, I get it: the Mexicans found him. I don't need a rosy ending, but at least reveal how his demise went down. I'm not even asking for a gory shootout sequence; just elaborate on what led up to it. Yes, there is an underlying commentary on fate and humanity, but this movie is also an action/crime thriller where multiple peripheral characters are strangled or blown away by a sociopathic killer. It seems disingenuous to skim over the main character's death. Moss never had a chance, and neither does the viewer.","

"Nadja-6","14 March 2008","I hated it. It's the first time I've had to say that Tommy Lee was not in a good movie. :-( I did not feel that the character development was good for anyone but Lewellyn and his wife. You really got to know and like Lewellyn, and then abruptly he's gone. We didn't see enough of his wife. Tommy Lee's performance was fine, but he was hard to understand most of the time. What's with Woody's character? Why was it even a part of the movie, it didn't really add anything to it. They could have left out all the scenes with the guy who hires him, too, and it would not have changed the movie. Anton has no redeeming qualities and is quite boring as a character. All in all I was very disappointed with a movie that got so many accolades.","

"come2whereimfrom","13 January 2008","A huge fan of their early work and pretending that the last few films they made didn't happen I had high expectations for Joel and Ethan Coen's latest project. Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel 'No Country' is a return to form for the sibling filmmakers or at least it is for the first hour and a half. What starts off with some amazing cinematography and a Tommy Lee Jones voice-over boils over into a frenzied chase movie that has genuine tension running through its every pore and then sadly it doesn't really have an ending and all the good things that have come before seem somewhat spoilt. Javier Bardem is amazingly creepy as sociopath Anton Chigurh, his hair nearly as bizarre as his favourite method of killing, every line he delivers is unnerving and yet you hang off his every word. Josh Brolin Is great as Llewelyn Moss the Welder turned wanted man after he stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong and steals a case full of money so he and his wife can start a new life. Cue every man and his dog, literally, after Moss from cops to Mexicans and of course Nutcase extraordinaire Anton. There is very little screen time for either Lee Jones or Harrelson and if you blink you could be forgiven for missing either of their performances. There are some beautiful shots, some great lines and a fitting score but it is by no means perfect which is a shame. But for the most part the Coen's flourishes can be seen and there is nearly as much tension and suspense as there is blood but with such a strange ending and so many loose ends like not actually telling the viewer what happened or why I feel they still have some way to go to regain former glories, but this is at least a start.","

"moostrength","29 December 2007","This review may contain a spoilers, I'm not giving a summation of the movie plot here, but be forewarned, for your own information, that I might make references and/or hints to the storyline in this review.This movie isn't so much as a movie as it is an anecdote. It's like watching some dismal abyss of a film, with no plot, no real ending, and just a depressing story that basically comes down to no discernible resolve.The actor's are spot on, Tommy Lee Jones is as good an actor as anyone, he's always suited as the strong, masculine, and wise individual salted with the experience of ten men's lives. It is a role that he is very suited for, and in the last 15 years or so, from the role he plays in the various US Marshals series to the beyond his expectations of years in Rules of Engagement, etc; he is very much the tired old veteran who feels he has lived beyond the expectation of his life, and much of the movie you feel that reflection in his acting. Javier Bardem is clearly the self absorbed evil character that so many movies have, and yet he never has any closure. We never get a sense that justice has reacted to his narrow misses with death.Josh Brolin plays a convincing role at times, but I take issue with certain points in the movie. !!SPOILER!!WARNING!!SPOILER!! For example, at one point Brolin appears in the wild to be a successful and talented tracker. He portrays someone who is not so much intelligent as he is wise to his surroundings and the fragile nature of life. And yet he misses a deer he's hunting (why is he in the desert in the first place is beyond me). Then when he revisits the scene of the various trucks scattered upon a drug deal gone awry, he doesn't bring his rifle nor his binoculars? Why would you approach a situation where Drug money is clearly involved without a long range rifle, and more importantly no ability to defend yourself? How smart do you have to be to dump a bag full of money for a new bag? Have none of these people considered that there might be some kind of tracking device? Brolin saw the locater earlier. What did he think it was for, Radio Control Cars??? I kind of feel like this is one of those movies that got cut too many times before the film reached the studios, and as a result we're left with a story that doesn't have a plot line. We're left with no explanation really of who orchestrated the Heroin deal, why it went bad, more so at first it appears that Woody Harelson is some photographic memory genius and then gets ambushed by Bardem. How did Javier track him? Spidey sense? Sixth Sense? Did he invoke the Great Spirit from beyond? Come on.... at least give some kind of detail on how and why Woody is even involved? Why would Woody even leave the money untouched? Six out of ten is gracious, only because the acting is so good, but next time, if the movie needs to be thirty minutes longer to get a story across, do it. Because this movie is a mess. I think this must be how everyone at the season ending of Entourage felt when they screened Vinnie's cluster-you-know-what of a movie....Great acting, Great actors, but a story that is about like watching Happy Gilmore take a swing at the puck....","

"Shilo_R_A","20 August 2023","""What you got ain't nothing new. This country is hard on people.""
-----
""Well, I got here the same way the coin did.""No Country for Old Men is a 2007 film directed by the Coen Brothers, adapted from a book by the same name that was released two years prior. It's considered by many to be the best Coens' film, and it's the second film of theirs that I watch (the previous was Fargo, which I liked quite a bit).The movie follows Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a Texas man who finds one day a large sum of money, with enough evidence around to know that it's blood money alright. He takes it anyway, and this action sets in motion a game of cat-and-mouse, as Moss flees from the Mexican cartel and one Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a cold-blooded man you definitely don't want to encounter in real life. There's also the town sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who tries to reach Moss first and get him to a safe place.One thing that makes this film pretty immersive for me for most of its runtime is the lack of music in the background for almost the entire runtime of this movie. Most of the sounds we hear are diegetic - the wind blowing, a light switch switched off, soft footsteps getting closer. Even when there is some music it's very, very subtle. This film pulls it off pretty well, especially in the tenser, slow-burning scenes.The second thing I want to focus on is something you've probably heard of even if you're yet to watch this film but you have some background on it - Chigurh, the villain, is probably the most memorable aspect of No Country for Old Men. For me, also the best part of the film. Javier Bardem delivered a precise performance here, which granted him the Oscar for best supporting actor, but it's more than that. Chigurh is so effective because of how clever, how ruthless, how methodical and cold-blooded he is. He's also somewhat alien, following his set of rules that we can't completely understand, and it makes him more creepy and unexpected and, well, entertaining. The cat-and-mouse game is so effective mostly because both characters involved do a lot of creative and clever things that are shown to us so we can put the puzzle pieces together ourselves. It's making the watching experience more active. Comparing it to Death Note may be a bit of a stretch but I feel like it's worth bringing up.The film is filled to the brim with violence that is almost casual, character deaths that happen in a blink of an eye, bloodshed that isn't shown in any dramatic or grand way. It's just there. The main idea of the film, the way I see it at least, is how chaotic and random and scary the world is, and always has been. Just like Chigurh (which is key to understand the underlying message in my opinion), the world has its own set of rules that we can't quite understand, and we try to bargain with the world but in the end it gets us all. Always was like this, complicated and dangerous and full of odd rules.I'll also briefly address the cinematography, which I find really solid and well-crafted, and the dialogue, which has a lot of cynical wit and iconic moments which I'm sure will stick with me for a while.The ending of this film, while I can understand the artistic value behind it, still makes the story feel somewhat incomplete to me. Maybe it will be a motif with the Coen Brothers' films and me, I don't know, but I'd even say that it bothers me here more than it does in Fargo, since here the choice to end this story in such an odd way is much more unexpected and extreme than the lack of catharsis in Fargo. It just bothers me, even if I get the reasoning behind it.I'd say that when it comes to emotional investment I wasn't really there, and I know that it's not this kind of movie but I still feel like I should've cared a little more for Moss as a character than I actually did, which isn't to say that I don't like the character at all but something doesn't fully click with me, for some reason.Overall, No Country for Old Men is an interesting take on the premise of being one against the world, and it provides a very well-made display of a clever cat-and-mouse game with a lot of bloodshed and gunpowder. The villain is especially great. The ending feels a little off to me, and though I know why it still doesn't fully click with me. Still, a good movie. I'm feeling a 7.8/10 on this one.","

"ElMaruecan82","7 August 2014","With its fatalistic resonance, the quote, used by the Coen brothers in ""Raising Arizona"" and borrowed from ""The Night of the Hunter"" could almost work as a subtitle for ""No Country for Old Men""And any critic toward 2007' Best Picture Winner, is irremediably confronted to that opening ""No"" summarizing everything the film stands for: nothing. The Coens brothers made fun of nihilists in ""The Big Lebowsky"" gave the word an entire new dimension here, thrilling like a dream and haunting like a nightmare. Indeed, in this film, it's not the night, but the ""Nightmare of the Hunter"".But I'll be honest, I didn't get it the first time I saw it, but I give myself the benefit of the doubt since I was 25 at that time, and I think I was intelligent enough to grasp the film's concept. And indeed, I saw it again yesterday, 5 days before my 32nd birthday, and I didn't get it more than the first time; except that I started looking at the so-called flaws with more comprehensive eyesI remembered the words I choose to title my review of ""Shane"", an old-fashioned and traditional Western classic, ""the unseen and the unspoken elevate it to its iconic status"". This description also works for ""No Country for Old Men"", except that the unseen is what divided opinions the most, it's for what we didn't see that some believed this movie had more a lot to say than what its first acts presented, but it's also why the rest felt betrayed and dismissed it as a pretentious attempt of making art for the sake of it.But let's get back to the film. There are three men that fate reunited (although they'll never meet), each one is in one side of what we, humble mortals, call morality. There's Sheriff Bell, played by Tommy Lee Jones, an old timer contemplating the degeneration of humanity through the peaks of barbarity crimes had reached. But we can't be fooled, surely he belongs to a time where lynching, rapes and horrific crimes prevailed, he's not too old but too good and goodness and strength don't form quite an efficient pair.On the other side, there's the one who elevated the film to its iconic status, Anton Chigurh (Oscar-winning Javier Bardem) the most impacting movie villain since Hannibal Lecter. He's dark, tall, looking even bigger thanks to a meticulous camera work, has a deep authoritative voice and an ominous aura above his shoulder, like a real-life Darth Vader. He would indeed look like Darth Vader from behind with his weird haircut. And there's his inseparable oxygen tank hiding under an everyday banality, a spectacularly deadly weapon. Anyway, in vileness department, Anton means business. And in the course of his morbid odyssey, he'll meet friendly people from the American side of Rio Grande, and many of them will pay the biggest price to their encounter, a price that can be worth a quarter sometimes. Anton reminded me of a story about a king who was so cruel that when he surprised one of his slaves mocking him in public, he then told him the worse punishment had to come. What did he do? Nothing, and that was even worse, because the poor man died out of fearful stress. This is what we, what the poor gas station attendant understand, life can hang on nothing, a simple call, a coin, two millions, whatever.Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is a hunter who found two million dollars in the middle of the desert, only trophy from a drug deal that left many Mexican cadavers and a dog rotting in the desert, the crime scene is magnificently rendered by Roger Deakins' cinematography, like a still-life painting. There's still life indeed, Moss takes the money and run, but out of principles, gets back to the crime scene to give some poor man's water. Wrong move, he puts himself on the track and worse, gets Chigurh on his footsteps. Moss is in the crossroads, bad enough to steal and endanger his sweet and caring wife Carla Jean (Kelly MacDonald) but good enough to care. You know at that time that either him or Anton will survive.We have a sadistic killer, whose use of violence is random, remorseless and even more chilling when you try to give it a meaning. Then, you have a fatalistic journey where despite all of Moss' efforts, you feel like there's no way he'll get through it, because there's a movement incarnated by Chiugurh' slow walk in the middle of a motel, from nowhere to someone, this is the Great Reaper coming, you can't escape from it, you can only postpone the delay. And there's the main protagonist, a defeatist sheriff who can't face the facts that he's not cut for the job anymore, and spends most of his time desperately static, the's the nihilistic, he's the ""No"" in the title. He's the main character, the key of the story.That might explain the narrative liberties the Coens took  both Moss and Chigurh are neatly drawn characters, they're mysterious but not their motives, and the movie's intelligence shall rise above obviousness. Bell, in his last courageous attempt to listen to Carla Jean's pleas, to save Moss and get Anton, comes too late, he didn't see what happened, neither did we. Why insisting on so many details, so many on-screen deaths, why making Woody Harrelson introduced as a bad-ass bounty hunter and killed as mercilessly as you stamp on a cockroach?Because it's the unseen that best expresses life's futility, things either guided by God or the devil's hand, and there's no guarantee that goodness will be rewarded and that's what scares the most. The film has style, yes, but it's not about being deep, depth is nothing when nothingness can be deeperSo, don't blame the Coens brothers for what you didn't see, blame Sheriff Bell.","

"hu675","27 March 2009","""No Country for Old Men"" isn't a hard movie to enjoy. Not the the acclaimed Oscar-Winning filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen (Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou ?, Raising Arizona) certainly rise to the occasion with this intriguing film that won Four Academy Awards... including Best Picture, Best Director(s), and Best Supporting Actor (Javier Bardem).An Ordinary Man by the name of Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds his way into a bloody crime scene. He sees a couple of dead bodies, a dead dog and a pickup full of heroin. But Llewelyn also discover two million dollars that he couldn't resist. But a cold blooded killer named Anton Chirugh (Bardem) follows the trail of West Texas to find the money. Now it's a game of Cat and Mouse, which Llewelyn tries to outsmart Chriugh to no success. A decided sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Oscar-Winner Tommy Lee Jones) finds himself caught in the middle.Directed Joel and Ethan Coen, who also wrote the Oscar-Winning adaptation from the Pulitzer Prize Author Cormac McCarthy (All the Pretty Horses, The Road). The Coen Brothers made an highly watchable film, it has atmospheric Texas landscapes, realistic settings, incredible suspense, clever touches of black comedy, tightly edited (Which the Coen Brothers won another Oscar but they used a pseudonym for editing the movie) and Bardem's scene-stealing performance as a psychopath murderer makes this movie... a must see.The Production Values are used strongly here, especially Roger Deakins' widescreen cinematography (He received an Oscar nomination for his work) and the rate use of no music score in the movie (expect only in the credits) makes this picture extremely tense by using only sound effects by giving the feature more credit. Anyone who enjoys thrillers will be not disappointed.The actors are top notch here... Jones' gives an quiet good performance as a West Texas Sheriff, who doesn't like the way civilization is crumbling (Which the film's title would make sense to his character). Brolin is very good as the man will do anything to keep his irresistible two million dollars. Bardem is outstanding here, he gives one of the most coldest killers in film history (Not to mention his character name Anton Chigurh is certainly memorable). Kelly MacDonald is fine as Moss' worried wife, Carla Jean. Woody Harrelson has a few scenes as a hired hit-men to kill Chigurh and find the money. Stephen Root (Best known for doing the voice of Bill in the animated series ""King of the Hill"") plays a mysterious rich drug runner, who tries to rip-off Chigurh. Garret Dillahunt (Just recently played Krug in the remake of ""The Last House on the Left"") gives the movie some comic relief as a inexperienced sheriff.Although i never read the novel. This is a solid motion picture with hair-raising suspense, it has a sense of humor and a strong cast. I wasn't surprise, when this movie won the top categories at the Academy Awards. This was one of the most critically acclaimed features of 2007. It is a movie, i would watch every year. But i think, it was close being a masterpiece (Which are truly rare in today's cinema). I felt the only fault in the movie is in the end, when Bell recently retired from being the sheriff. He sits quietly in the kitchen table with his wife (Tess Harper). He tells two stories about him as a boy, he found lost money that was given by his late father. The other story that his father rode past him on a snowy mountain pass, going ahead to make a fire in the surrounding cold darkness. Whenever Bell got there, he knew his father would be waiting... then he woke up. I felt the conclusion ended abruptly. I remember seeing that movie with an audience, they were certainly confused. But i wasn't and i thought that wasn't really the right way to end a terrific movie like this, that's the only flaw in it.The DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD also includes three featurettes. Overall ""No Country for Old Men"" is a excellent movie. I haven't seen this much suspense handed so genuinely like this before. It is certainly the most straightforward film coming from the Coen Brothers. Which they are known for their bizarre original comedies. It's a certainly an modern near classic that should not be missed. Super 35. (**** 1/2 out of *****).","

"Chilangojoe","12 November 2007","Beneath the eye-catching photography and violence, and the good acting, there lies an empty plotTo call this ""film of the year"" is to ignore that the world is a big place, and full of films that are a lot better. This film simply didn't live up to the critical acclaim it garnered prior to release. Yes, Tommy Lee Jones does a good turn, as does Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem is somewhat unusual. The bleak countryside is well filmed and one of the reasons I cannot forswear multiplexes, and the violence also grabs the viewer's attention, but even that artifice wears off as the violence simply becomes monotonous.The critics have uncovered nuances that separate this film from the classic Hollywood blood-and-guts formula, the most notable of which is that the lawman doesn't get the bad guy in the end. The trouble is that beyond critics counting angels on heads of pins, the Coens have retained hackneyed Hollywood clichés aplenty, the most egregious of which is the psycho who comes from nowhere, a plot device that dates back to the devil featuring in mediaeval morality plays and was debunked by the time Shakespeare was a lad. Hitchcock famously explained why Norman Bates became a psycho, and his suspense was all the more masterful as Anthony Perkins didn't look like a killer, just the Mummy's boy he really was.With Hitchcock, you know something very bad is going to happen; but the suspense lies in not knowing what, by whom or when. After the first few minutes with Bardem's character, however, you know he will do the killing, you know how and you know it will be sooner rather than later. The only time the evil Chigurgh acquires more than one dimension is when people tell him he has a screw loose, but he just doesn't get it. Otherwise, he's as predictable as Terminator. We also have no idea where he learned his Rambo or Jason Bourne tricks, or how he gets to be better informed than the cops, and that is just one of many plot holes. Bardem has acted much better before, as when he diversified from tongue-in-cheek macho roles years ago in films like ""Carne Trémula"" or ""Segunda Piel"". He successfully masks his native accent, but ends up sounding a bit too machine-like.We can see Chigurh is after a pot of drug money, but just who the hell is he? Who are the ""managerial"" guys who put him in the picture? We are left to guess that Woody Harrelson is a hired man, but told nothing about his background, who does the hiring, or why. And why is Woody's character stunningly efficient one minute, in tracking down Moss, while allowing Chigurh to sneak up on him the next? We are also meant to believe that a full-blown drug war can break out with just a lone sheriff on the case, without the feds getting involved. Yes, there is a lot of disbelief to be suspended in seeing this picture.And then there is the foray across the border, which is corny and stereotypical to any one who has ever lived for a while in Mexico. Since when do norteño bands dress like mariachis? Since when do they serenade blood-stained gringo vagrants, for nothing, and in the morning? Since when do foreigners with bullet wounds get admitted to hospital, no questions asked? This has as much to do with the real Mexico as nachos and chile con carne. Could the Coens find not one Mexican adviser?OK, so maybe this is beside the point, that the film is really all about a man getting too old for his job, as the very title suggests, but even here the plot is full of holes. It is all very well for the sheriff's uncle to wistfully say that a lot of nasty stuff has always happened on the border, but that ignores the fact that drug trafficking entails a dangerous mix of grinding poverty and instant fortunes which has made things nastier, all along the supply and distribution routes; Mexican towns once known for little more than growing avocadoes now have severed heads rolled across dance floors, and the country's equivalent of David Letterman was wasted in broad daylight.Even that hollow and superficial take on drugs violence fails to grasp the nettle of centuries of brutality, of slavery and killing Indians, in making the U.S. what it is. And yes, it is possible to cover all these bases in a two-hour film. I will certainly look for them, and for answers to all the plot holes, should I ever read Cormac McCarthy's original novel.For a sense of just how disturbingly omnipresent drug-fuelled violence is, and how it ends up breeding more violence, ""La Vírgen de los Sicarios"" did the job far better, but with Spanish dialogue and being made in Colombia, it never came to the attention of the critics who heap undeserving praise on the Coen brothers.","

"areatw","5 September 2017","The Coen brothers have given us many great movies, but 'No Country for Old Men' has to be my favourite of theirs. This film is 10 years old now but you'd be hard-pressed to find a better piece of entertainment released since. It's an enthralling watch from start to finish and one of the most memorable and unique movies of its time. Maybe it's a bold claim, but I think this is one of the best films of the 2000s.'No Country for Old Men' scores top marks in all areas, but the best part of the film for me is the characters and dialogue exchanges between them. Anton Chigurh in particular is a fascinating character and is brilliantly portrayed by Javier Bardem.The ending has proved divisive among fans, but I'm in the 'liked it' camp. Finishing with the 'old man' of the movie retiring is fitting with the title and was also suitably low-key. A brilliant film all round.","

"jazkat","22 January 2008","This film went absolutely nowhere! It was confusing with gaping holes in the story and plot that leave the viewer wondering who people are, how they got to where they are, what really happened, and why. It feels like the Coen bros. ran out of ideas, footage, and money, so they slapped together whatever they had on-hand for an ending.You have to give the Coens credit for artistic style and for building a gripping, gritty experience for the first hour. The film was thoroughly engrossing from the beginning. The acting was excellent. They created a masterful concoction of brutal killer hunting the ""little-guy trying to making it big"". They get us emotionally invested in the underdog and put us on the edge of your seats routing for the little-guy just to survive. Unfortunately that's about the time things implode. The Coens drop the viewer into a spiral of confusion and reward our emotional investment with nothing. It left me wondering why they released such an unfinished film.Tommy Lee Jones was sadly under utilized. He is an immense talent and screen presence relegated to an impotent, pseudo-supporting roll. His character is irrelevant to the plot and only leaves us wishing he had a bigger part. His closing scene only serves to further the confusion.The true offenders in this debacle are the ""Film Critics"" and Academy brass who have hyped this mess. Just because the Coen brothers' name is on it does not make it genius.","

"perica-43151","19 July 2018","If you want a movie about a likable but menacing hero (or perhaps antihero), then this is a movie for you. An effective agent of fate, Javier Bardem's character does not care what you think about his haircut or his ways. What he cares about are rules. But not your rules, he has a set of his own, just like in his world, he has the coolest haircut there is. And he wears it with confidence. The same confidence he executes his tagets, who have it coming. One way or the other, on the flip of a coin. And his ways are memorable, you have to give him that. This angel of death plays some sort of cat and mouse game, but this is not a man, this is a sublime being, and he is magnificent, inspiring awe. Cant say awesome since this word is ruined in the English language, but in 1940s, it would have been the most appropriate way to describe what the actor Bardem delivers. This is a must see movie...","

"SafReviews","2 October 2020","For me, the beginning and the ending prevented the movie being from being a good and thrilling movie. The first 20 to 30 minutes of the movie was slow which I didn't mind to be honest because the movie started to get more intriguing and I started to understand and follow the plot a bit more. So the movie was good until towards the last 30 or so minutes where it was anticlimactic because they didn't show the big final action scene like the vast majority of other movies do. I understand they was trying to be different from the other movies, but the ending just didn't give me a satisfying and intrigued feeling which movie endings should do. Positives of the movie are that I thought the action scenes were good and I liked the character Anton Chigurh because I thought he was very portrayed well.","

"robert-temple-1","28 October 2008","What is wrong with the Coen Brothers? If they are so clever, then why don't they do something pleasant? True, they are brilliant, talented, witty, but then so was Goebbels. This is a totally pointless, meandering tour of a seedy corner of Hell. Yes, there are fine performances. Tommy Lee Jones is a perfect joy to watch, his droll manner, his fabulous accent, his presence, are welcome even in such an evil film as this. Kelly MacDonald, who was spellbinding in the excellent TV series 'State of Play' (2003), is compulsively watchable and effective here. If you like convincing portraits of Satan, then by all means give an Oscar to Javier Bardem. Josh Brolin is earnest and convincing. Woody Harrelson is fascinating as always. Everybody is good, but the film is wicked, disgusting, offensive, and should never have been made except perhaps by Hell Productions Inc. The story does not even get anywhere. What is clear is that the voters for Academy Awards who have become so decadent and morally rotten and corrupt as to give this film Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Script, are prepared to glorify pure unadulterated evil on the screen, evil which has no redeeming qualities other than black humour, evil which does discredit to the film industry, corrupts the public, spreads despair, and corrodes the soul. Someone should take the Coen brothers out back and do the right thing, and as for the Academy voters, they should put their heads down the toilet bowl where their taste is to be found, judging from the way they voted, and drink what they evidently crave. Is this what we have come to? Complete, mindless, aimless, decadence? Violence with no point? Psychopaths for breakfast? Are our tastes so jaded that a series of brutal and bloody murders by a madman is all that is left which can titillate us? I say shame on all who made this film, shame on all who voted for it, shame on all who have praised it and given it awards. Do we really wonder how we have now had the Great Worldwide Economic Collapse, when this film and its enthusiastic welcome prove so conclusively that it was preceded by the Great Moral Collapse? All those rogue traders, short-sellers and hedge fund lunatics who are destroying lives by the millions through their greed and immorality are the very same people who watch films like this and love them. This film's success proves that there are no standards or values left. Pardon me while I vomit on screen in glorious technicolor.","

"zkonedog","6 March 2017","I have watched quite a few movies in my lifetime so far, but after viewing ""No Country For Old Men"" I can honestly say that I haven't really seen too many like this before.For a basic plot summary, this film begins by introducing ruthless killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a man the likes of which Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) cannot even comprehend. When Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds a briefcase full of money meant for Chigurh, it kicks off a tense chase between all three parties.The reason ""No Country For Old Men"" is such a solid film is because it is so deep on a number of different yellows. All three main characters are interesting and make you truly care (one way or another) about their actions, especially the viciousness of Anton (that is probably the one aspect of the movie I will always remember).Despite the fact that this is a very deep, thought-provoking movie, it is also quite sparse and terse (perhaps more sparse than any movie I've ever seen). There is no dramatic music (no contrived drama whatsoever, to be honest), no montage sequences, no character flashbacks, or any bells-and-whistles. It is completely ""straight down the line"", so to speak. If you are a fan of that type of stark filmmaking, this will be one of your all-time favorite.All told, I enjoyed watching this movie for the amount of themes it threw at me and particularly the way it portrayed the ""new type of killer"" in the modern world (even in the more traditional Texas). I prefer a movie with a little more obvious drama, so no five stars from me, but other than that I would recommend this to any fan of interesting cinema that does not conform to any other standard but its own.","

"dbborroughs","5 January 2008","I'm going to have to think about this film a while. I watched the new Cohen Brothers film because of all the best picture nods its gotten in the last couple of days. Clearly my thoughts on the film have been colored by the high esteem the film has.I like it I don't don't love it. Deeply Philosophical and existential western chase film seems to have been put on the screen to win awards. The film seems more allegory than real with a few twists (the late night move by Josh Brolin that makes everything come together is clearly deus ex machina- actually it makes it Greek tragedy since that one act is the weakness that brings down the wrath of the god(s).) and its drive to be about something deeper helped keep the film at arms length for me. Actually the real problem was I never liked Josh Brolin's character. He is marginally better than his pursuer and I never really felt I knew him enough to care. Brolin's Moss' every man in conflict with force of nature/hand of malevolent God Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh isn't someone I could identify with except as a literary notion of a flawed Gary Cooperesque character. These are archetypes not real people. Its so arch and over the top-at least to me- that I wanted to laugh at the silliness of the machismo (though Anton Chigurh is probably one of the five most malevolent characters ever to walk across the screen). I'm curious what the film would be if the Greek chorus bits with Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson were removed since I think its these often oblique passages, while genuinely thought provoking, are the reason that everyone feels the film is something more than a good western tale. (What if we had a Greek chorus commenting on the events in the James Brolin film Night of the Juggler, would that have made it more than a chase film?) I really DO like the film, I just can't believe that the film has been so invested with such deep meaning (Things thought of while watching the movie: The end of Greed; the failed Cohen brother's attempt at filming James Dickey's To the White Sea; any number of 1930's or 40's westerns;Zane Grey and Louis L Amour Westerns; Mindwalk;Frankensteins pursuit of his creation into the wastes; ...and a few other things-several other bleak chase films- that have started to fade with the lateness of the hour) Oh yea and as for the off screen events that people have complained about...I think they're crazy. I think we see what we need to.7.5 out of 10","

"mgregory-9","25 February 2008","Killers everywhere and the FBI not to be seen. Drugs everywhere and the DEA only mentioned in the background and never to be seen.The local police say to the guy being chased to look after himself and let him go. Not a single policeman to ""stake out"" or ""follow"" the guy with the money. This is after the mass killing at the start of the movie and several more after this. Gee wiz the police must have more to do than worry about solving crime. What rubbish.The worst plot aspect of this film is the guy who gets the money is portrayed as smart, a real outdoors man. Yet to get lost with the cash he stays in his home town, then moves to the local city and finally heads to the family home - and of course - oh so obvious - his mother in law tells the bad guys where he is going.Surely a smart outdoors hunter would know that the best way to get lost fast would be to go to New York or Paris and then disappear.Could go on for hours about the poor story line and plot faults, but you got to see this for yourself to realize it is typical Coen Brothers where reality is forgotten and fantasy ensues.","

"kevin_robbins","21 June 2023","No Country for Old Men (2007) is a movie that is in my DVD collection and I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The first time I saw this was actually at an advanced screening with Josh Brolin in Georgetown. The storyline follows a simple man out hunting one day in Texas when he comes across some murdered men at the boarder and a truck full of cash. He takes the cash but is quickly tracked by a ruthless man with a unique form of killing whom wants his money. Meanwhile a sheriff ready to retire is on the tracks of the killer, but can he find him before he catches the man with the money?This movie is directed by the Coen Brothers (Raising Arizona) and stars Tommy Lee Jones (Men in Black), Josh Brolin (W), Woody Harrelson (CHEERS), Javier Bardem (Skyfall), Kelly Macdonald (Boardwalk Empire), Beth Grant (Donnie Darko) and Stephen Root (Office Space).Everything about this movie is brilliant. The storyline, characters, kills, dialogue and circumstances are so unique and intriguing. The cast delivers an awesome performance, especially Bardem, Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. I always find myself rooting for all three characters. Every scene feels authentic and believable despite every sequence being unpredictable. The settings and pace of the movie is perfect and I adore the metaphors throughout the movie. The narration is also very good and sets the mood for the film. The ending is sad and rewarding at the same time.Overall, everything about this movie is brilliant. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.","

He is then hunted by various people who want the money.""No Country For Old Men"" is different from what I thought it would be. It is not as mischievously fun as ""The Ladykillers"", or as plot driven as ""Miller's Crossing"". Instead, ""No Country For Old Men"" uses a lot of cold blooded shocks. Javier Bardem is amazing as a cold blooded person. His face never even twitch a bit when he kills random people. However, the plot is a little hard to follow. There are many loose ends that are not explained. I am also a bit annoyed by the surrealistic ease of everyone finding everyone.","

Times alluding to this film as a simple chase movie. And that's about the gist of it. The only humanity in this film comes from Llewelyn's wife and the sheriff. Beyond that, there's just no depth to this film. I was a film student at Maryland. I'm 43, and I have seen some of the greatest films ever made - foreign and domestic. I have also seen everything in between. Some reviewer said this was a 'brilliant examination of fate'. Huh? Really, how much depth is there in a coin toss to determine if the killer slays his victim or not?! The saddest part of the film is Tommy Lee Jones' character. He hovers around basically doing nothing, and just mildly investigates the crimes. He never encounters the 'good guy' or the bad guy until the good guy's dead. He misses the bad guy, BTW. Unfortunately, I didn't see the other candidates - but I figure at least ONE of them has to be better than this slick B movie...","

"Jonny_Numb","8 December 2007","At various moments in ""No Country for Old Men,"" we are shown rusty, weather-beaten windmills squeaking in the dry desolation of the American Southwest, doing their 360-degree revelations in the passing wind. This imagery ties in nicely with the elliptical nature of the characters and plot (based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy), but also shows Joel and Ethan Coen coming full circle within their own career, as this film plays like a ""desert noir"" companion to their debut feature, ""Blood Simple"" (1985).The brothers' requisite plot devicea large sum of money being stolen and sought afterfinds an Everyman foil in Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who happens upon a massacre site where a drug deal went awry, and makes off with a satchel of cash pried from a dead man's hands. His wife, Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) is skeptical, and it is not until Llewelyn commits an act of charity that he finds himself in a relentless chase to outrun the innumerable factions seeking the cash. As in McCarthy's novel, these factions are vaguely defined at best, save for Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a seemingly indestructible boogeyman who possesses no loyalty, and only the faintest trace of humanity (some of his potential victims are absolved by the luck of a coin toss). Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (one of the ""old men"" of the title, played with depth and grace by Tommy Lee Jones) is the outsider intermediary, whose own jaded feelings toward the inexplicable senselessness of crime in America is magnified in the increasingly nihilistic pursuit between Chigurh and Moss.""No Country"" is like a symphony of aesthetics, with the Coens showing an affinity for wide-angle photography (captured by DP Roger Deakins) of the vast American Southwest; close-ups of faces of a variety of ages, weathered by age or fatigue or shrapnel; sound-effects editing so razor-precise that the squeaking of an oxygen valve or the clicking of a safety-catch in an otherwise silent scene is enough to inspire chills. Also worth noting is the absence of musical score, with Carter Burwell's orchestrations swelling only a few moments after the end credits have started to roll.I find it refreshing that, in our era of cinematic spectacle, replete with CGI-candy, that ""No Country"" derives much of its impact from the characters themselves, often filmed in the aforementioned close-ups that makes their dialogues resonate with a profoundalmost meditativeurgency, conveyed wonderfully in the subtly understated performances. This is an interesting adaptive choice on the Coens' part, since many of their films take a parodic approach toward ""country folk"" as witless yokels designed as vessels for comedy. And while ""No Country"" finds some clever comic asides (Moss's exchange with a testy American border guard is a gem), the tone is that of pervasively ominous uncertaintythe tags of ""hero"" and ""villain"" are not easily applied, and the Coens are not above showing the moral ambiguity of their characters with a flatly objective eye.And the performances are indicative of this flat objectivity. Talented character actor Josh Brolin (""The Goonies""; ""Grindhouse"") embodies the quirks, flaws, and traits (both heroic and anti-heroic) of Llewelyn; Bardem is a towering iceberg of intimidation, whose Chigurh becomes an almost-infallible extension of some mythic desert dweller (existing solely in a world of self-obligation and passive violence); Jones brings a worldly wisdom and depth to Ed Tom, the glue that bonds the narrative; English actress Macdonald (probably best known for ""Trainspotting"") slips into a Southern accent and conveys the necessary fearand finally, acceptanceof being an unwitting pawn in a situation beyond her control.In the end, there is a paradoxical thematic synthesis as two characters ""walk away"" from obligation and into a future that is, at best, uncertain (the characters ""unite"" in a slow fade); and while Bell's closing recollection of a dream veers into Oscar-nod territory, it perfectly resolves ""No Country for Old Men,"" a story so open-ended and incendiary that its grislier moments could easily be culled from today's national headlines. The movie may be set in 1980, but its parable-like presentation will prove timeless. One of 2007's best.","

"onepotato2","20 November 2007","I'm an enormous fan of Blood Simple and not much else from the Coens. I consider The Big Lebowski, and The Ladykillers two of the dumbest films ever made. This movie is much better than the Coen's last 8 genre ripoffs. Its structure is very forthright; it's a pleasure to watch the Coens make plot points and connections with something other than dialog; you have to pay attention (but really not even that much) to understand/anticipate the motivation of the next scene. Even respected directors (Scorcese) have become dependent on actors explaining things to make plot points; and been filming talky scripts with little invention. It's just better when it's done in a filmic manner. The wordless connections here reminded me of the silent sequences where plot develops in Antonioni's Blowup.The real problem with the movie begins about the time Jones who has been an internalized man of few words for the whole movie, meets up with his brother and suddenly becomes effusive. Everything that was underplayed, or in the subtext, becomes hideously direct and clumsy. Jones had already been heading for a best actor nom, but the Coens apparently wanted to give him a hammy scene or two to pump the Oscar-consideration process, in the media hype that leads up to that free-for-all. These scenes are leaden.It's generally very economical. All the questions I wondered about were answered with a little thought except one; How the hell do Jones and Bardem not encounter each other in the hotel room? Also the title is so dumb it almost prevented me from seeing it; telegraphing the theme, the ending, the final score, etc. I can imagine about a thousand better titles. And changing it from the book may have grated them the freedom to scrap some bookish scenes. You could toss everything away that occurs after Bardem exits the family household and looks at his boots. In these places it begins to look like their meandering, pointless Man who Wasn't There. It has about 4 endings too many.I've recently revised this review downward after a suitable amount of time has passed. I am utterly neutral (no interest) about seeing this movie a 2nd time, so it failed there for me. It also doesn't make me contemplate a thing, not even film technique.","

"JulzGaye","13 March 2008","During the first half to two-thirds of the film, the characters were building, which left one to think this was really going someplace, albeit slowly. Other characters were then added in completely unnecessarily. What was the purpose of the complete waste of time Woody Harrelson!? There were ends left flopping in the breeze that you thought surely would tie down as some point, but never did. The storyline was all over the place. Although you know who kills the main character, the creators of this film didn't see fit to show or explain how that came about, which was an important part of the story. It felt strongly like that scene just wasn't included because it would have been too much trouble and/or expense which was cheesy and lame. Tommy Lee Jones, who you expect to be significant was rarely seen or heard from and was downgraded to some form of powerless hick dreamer. Josh Brolin is very nice to look at but didn't have much of a story to act. His character exhibited some semblance of intelligence but never looked for an electronic tracking device in the loot! The Spaniard, Javier Bardem (Anton) did a decent job of pulling off creepy and I'm sure we'll be seeing much more of him in America. The last scene made me scream - ""This had better not be the end!"" But alas, it was! I have passed the DVD on to friends, but felt the need to be apologetic when I did so. It is astounding that this film got the awards & recognition it did. This rates right up there with Lost in Translation, Eyes Wide Shut, and Monsters Ball. The voters must be pod people.","

"Mover-4","11 January 2008","This Movie had great potential as being one of the great classic movies of all time. We were wrapped up in it from the beginning to the credits, but it did not end.I'm trying to figure out why there was a sheriff Bell character, as he didn't add anything to the story except one-liners.Don't get me wrong. Tommy Lee Jones' work was simply great. As was Brolin's, Bardem's, and all the others, I believed the character. But in the end, the sheriff had no affect on the storyline at all.And Woody Harrelson's character didn't add much. His purpose must have been to give Chigurh a reason to kill Stephen Root's character. Which makes you think, ""so what?"" We already knew this guy was nuts.The time allotted to that (killing Harrelson and Root) could have been used to end the movie.When the credits started scrolling, I said ""what???"". It just left ya hanging.After a few moments, I lamely justified it in my mind by speculating that there must be a part 2, a sequel, where Sheriff Wells brings a fitting end to the movie.","

"Samiam3","15 May 2010","As I sat in the theatre, about halfway through No Country for Old Men, I distinctly remember whispering to the person next to me this was Oscar gold. Little did I know that he was asleep. If nothing else, it just goes to show how peoples tastes vary, but I cannot imagine how anyone could fall asleep. This is a film that gets you hooked from scene one, and right until the ending, it is steeped in suspense, black humour, great direction and acting and it ain't afraid to get its hands dirty.Based on Cormack McCarthy's novel, No Country for Old Men dictates one simple truth. There is evil in the world, there always has been and there always will be. The previous generation of crime fighters including Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) are no match for a new generation of criminals, at the start of a new decade (the eighties). One such criminal is Anton Chigurth, who kills people with a pneumatic air gun. This strange fella is going after two million dollars in drug money which has been stolen by Llewelyn Moss. He is an ordinary Texan who just happens to stumble upon the after math of a drug deal gone wrong in the middle of the desert. He finds the money, and tries to figure out how to get him and his wife clear and safe. Meanwhile, the Mexican drug dealers, The Law, and Chigurth are all coming after him.It is all the little details in the film which are what contribute to its high quality. I'll give you a great example. No Country for Old Men, is sucked almost completely dry of music. In one or two scenes, there is a very soft synthesizer drone, but the silence is far more potent. Alfred Hitchcock with the Birds was the last time I saw a music-free feature film.No Country for Old Men is not for the soft of heart, or the squeamish, but it will be embraced by anyone and everyone who can appreciate great cinema. Though unfortunately it is not a very popular movie (or at least it wasn't when it came out), I have a feeling No Country for Old Men will age well.","

"nairtejas","2 September 2013","This is my second Coen Brothers' movie & I am already a fan. Because, it talks about life as a whole and not in parts.Always depicting violence, the makers in here have gone one step further into psychological reasoning behind the violence. The cast performance, cinematography, direction, plot & screenplay are perfect factors. Some of them are second only to music, although a little more engaging score could've changed my 8.2 rating. Speaking too much but not going over is what the plot does. The trembling effect it has on its viewers is that the definitions re boundless and 80% of the happenings are free to imagination. As the message that comes out of it is varied, No Country For Old Men is a must watch, since we need to feel the gravity of the other side of humanity.Alas, it does have its dull moments, mostly carried by conversations or self-thoughts. Personally, these are the only discrepancies I found.One more reason to watch is Javier Bardem & his phenomenal portrayal. Bravo!BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

"rob55-2","7 January 2008","As hard as I try, I cannot figure why this film is getting so much praise and critical acclaim. Part of the reason I watched this film (besides what I had heard from TV ads, the fact that it was directed by the Coen brothers and that it generally looked like an interesting film) was the great rating it had here on IMDb. When the film ended and the credits started to roll, I sat there scratching my head not about confusion over the film, but about how it got an 8.8 rating. Generally speaking, I find that I tend to agree with the ratings that various movies receive here on IMDb, but NCFOM is an exception to this track record. With that said, here are the problems I had with the film. For starters, there is nothing new or novel here, it's all been done before. Innocent bystander finds loot, bad guys want loot back, innocent bystander wants to keep money and runs for his life, innocent bystander gets killed. Next, Sheriff Bell seems to wander aimlessly through the movie always a day behind the protagonist and antagonist(s). Next, how is it that no one sees Chigurh walking around with the oxygen tank as a weapon. Or for that matter, the shotgun with the huge silencer on it. Actually, there were a lot of little things like that which stretched believability. How is it that the guy walking by on the street (immediately after Chigurh lights the gas-soaked rag on the car on the street) doesn't see this flaming rag sticking out of the car. And what's with killing off Moss so unceremoniously? For that matter, why kill off the wife? Finally, the whole dream story by Bell at the end, what a bunch of tripe. Obviously, there are people out there who got much more (real or imagined) out of NCFOM than I did and I guess I'm happy for them. Believe me, I wanted to like this movie, but ultimately, I couldn't get past it's shortcomings.","

"michael_the_nermal","10 March 2008","Major spoilers ahead!I know it may be trendy to have an ambiguous and incomprehensible ending, but in a film like this, it leaves a very unsatisfying taste in one's mouth. There were too many questions, which I will lazily and tritely list..right now:The killer walks free? Why? What of the money that was the catalyst for the plot? Where did it go? What is the true reason behind Javier Bardem's character's moral ambiguity? Why deny his own free will in deciding to commit the murders? And what is with his decision to allow his victims to choose their fate with a plot device ripped straight out of DC Comics (hint: watch another big movie with Tommy Lee Jones to find out what I'm talking about)? Why was Josh Brolin (the eldest male Goonie) killed in so unceremonious a fashion, without so much as a satisfying showdown with the killer? And, finally, what is with Hollywood's love affair with ultra-violence? The plot and themes were a little unclear as conveyed through the two main characters, those being The Eldest Male Goonie, now some crusty old cowpoke who decides to take the money and run, and some soulless, murderous hit-man. The movie was revving me up for some ""Falling Down""-like showdown between Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem, but the Coens purposefully bummed out the audience with a completely unsatisfying ending, where the bad guy escapes, and there is no real climax. I mean that in the strict literary sense: there is no climax to either the plot of the cat-and-mouse chase between Brolin and Bardem, or the pursuit by Jones of Bardem. The movie just...ends. Critics may call this a masterful twist ending, but many viewers might simply perceive this as poor writing. I must also protest the extensive gore and guts splattered through this film. It is very gratuitous and unnecessary to show such graphic carnage in order to further the plot or develop the characters. Even Bardem's evil character did not need to be shown strangling, then severing the jugular of a deputy in such graphic detail in order to convey his character's amoral, antisocial nature. What was with the slow death of the drug lord, showing him gurgling up his own blood as Bardem shot him? This is violence for its own sake, without any discussion of its moral implications to complement it. The pain and suffering of the characters killed is never explored or analyzed; it's just a superfluous scene in and of itself. The Coens are not the only ones responsible in Hollywood, but they do the audience no favors by relishing in the use of ultra-violence as an artistic motif. It is a disturbing trend that should be limited in so-called serious movies, as opposed to slasher horror movies where this is to be expected.The excessive, gratuitous violence and choppy script make this a difficult movie to enjoy, or even analyze. The storyline simply leaves too many unanswered questions for a regular moviegoer. As a result, ""No Country for Old Men"" is a half-finished, unsatisfying movie without a real climax or conclusion.","

"johnnyboyz","2 December 2009","The Coen Brothers' late 2007, early 2008 film No Country for Old Men has very, very quickly embedded itself as one of my favourites of the contemporary age of film-making. I've seen it a number of times now, two times of which have been in recent months alone – here is a film I get odd chills in just contemplating watching it or not. If there was a film released in Britain in the calendar year of 2008, that was better than this and wasn't Steven McQueen's Hunger, then I either haven't seen it or it doesn't exist. The film is a burning, brilliantly observed piece, encompassing the horror of the world; morality and plain pure old fashioned film making techniques such as the ability to build suspense and execute action. Once just isn't enough with No Country for Old Men.The film is a crime-infused, MacGuffin driven tale between two predominant sides playing cat-and-mouse with one another in the wide open playground that is the state of Texas in a dusty June, circa 1980. The two warring sides are Josh Brolin's downbeat and somewhat cynical Llewelyn Moss, and he's in direct competition with Spanish actor Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh; a cold and seemingly emotionless killer who appears to have gone rouge from his employers and is now on Moss' tail. Thrown in amidst these two are the elements of innocent bystanders; hide and seek games at road side motels; shop, trailer and toll booth workers; an angry group of Mexican gangsters whom show up in fits and starts with their own prerogative and the law themselves, this time in the shape of Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff, named Ed Tom Bell.The chaos is ignited when Moss, having accidentally shot a wild animal in the leg whilst trying to score a body shot, notices a trail of blood left by a pit-bull terrier. Moss observes the dog, who eerily looks back at him with a sort of knowing sense of what bloodshed and chaos comes with what he's just run away from: ""Trust me, it's not worth it"" seems to be the exclamation. At the site, made more shocking by the presence of bullet ridden mutts, Moss waltz's through a barren patch of land inhabited by dead drug dealers, automatic weaponry and shot-up trucks. A few hundred yards off is a few million dollars in cash, which he swipes after appearing to confront himself with the question. A distant storm begins to break, with feint cracks of thunder – the bag that contained the money is beginning to double up as Pandora's box.The film's immediate opening is a voice over uttered by a man that has seen better days. His comments, recollections and opinions on life and the world is juxtaposed by some fantastic Texas scenery. Bell talks of the old times, and how some sheriffs in the past barely drew their gun as there was so little crime – just 35 minutes in sees Bell's deputy, who's just a kid in comparison, drawing his gun to enter a potentially dangerous property. Bell's reaction to this is fascinating. The beauty of the locale shooting suggests that the man still loves his home area and the place in which he has spent his whole life, but looks on with concern; that times change and people have to change with them otherwise they'll be left behind. What follows this knowing observation, the film's central theme of making sense of it all, is a brutal murder - the first of many Chigurh will commit. The Coen's thrust you into the centre of Chigurh's world with this killing, setting up the white-knuckle ride and getting across this guy's cold efficiency; something that is put in contrast with Moss' earlier inability to take his time, take aim and shoot a nonthreatening wild animal.While widely accepted as one of the greatest screen villains from recent years, Chigurh is a collection of very basic but very effective things. Predominantly, his uncanniness is born out of his weapons of choice; those being a stun gun later established to exist so as to kill livestock painlessly as well as a standard pump action shotgun that comes complete with a silencer, thus creating an odd metallic whooshing noise when fired. His sly and sporadic use of ambiguous quotes and metaphors combine with his ruthless ability to play games and con those around him, out of methods of transportation or whatever. The scene in mind that sticks out most is the initial ""call it"" exchange at a petrol station, during which odd shaped pieces of material are lined up behind the supposed victim; all of which are in the shape of a crude noose suggesting impending death, doom or execution.The film is violent, but the attention to the repercussions of violence are what makes it seem more gruesome than it is. When characters get injured later on, they need to treat themselves and this focus is ten times more nasty and more effective than, for instance, lining up nothing characters in a Saw sequel and lopping their limbs off. The film is so very visceral in its attention to sound; the build ups to two motel exchanges between certain characters is arguably more exciting than the following action sequences with light switches, floor boards, cocked guns and distant telephone tones all playing their part. With a sense of humour running throughout that is as dry as those rough, dusty early desert scenes and a fantastically structured narrative revolving around this man Moss; the decisions he makes and how they affect those around him and who he loves, No Country for Old Men is a stunning film and one of the best of recent times.","

And the guy who's trained to do anything to find him. And the cop on pursuit.It's that kinda movie.This movie has such a subtle hard punch in the face that you don't see it coming. The pursuer is a really dark character. He has no personality, and yet he's kinda cool. Josh Brolin is pretty hard hitting too. The underdog type of guy. Not the most attractive, kinda short, stocky, oddly shaped. But he's the main character. The cowboy, the man! And then everything else.This movie comes together perfectly.

"dazend1","13 September 2008","I think the Coen's need to go back to film school and learn the basic rules of film making. One of which is that you never leave the audience hanging like they did with this production. All the actors delivered a great performance, but it is hard to do any great acting job when the Directors keep killing off the characters just as they start to get interesting. I set through this movie and just when it started to really get interesting the whole thing ends without even leaving it up to the audience to decide what would happen next as their was nothing to decide on. That was what the story was supposed to accomplish and failed to do. It just goes to show that what Hollywood is really lacking these days is ""Talent"". The new generation of film makers is either to lazy to come up with an interesting story line and decide that it is easier to make a re-make of an old classic just because the screen play is already done or in this case they are trying to be funny by just leaving out an ending to the whole movie. I would hope that they would have some excuse like they were over budget and just ran out of film, but to end a movie as they did without a conclusion to the story is not only very disappointing to the theater goer, but very stupid as well. Just my opinion, but this was one movie that I did demand my money back as it seems they were just missing the last reel. Go see it though and you be the judge for yourself. Enjoy! Yours in the movies.","

"rmax304823","26 June 2008","It's hard to know exactly what to make of this film because it doesn't follow the usual narrative structure. Bad things happen to people, whether they are good, bad, or indifferent. And the soft-spoken but menacing murdering man in black who simply kills anyone who gets in his way, and even a couple who don't, walks away into the sunset. And the hero, Tommy Lee Jones as the aging Texas sheriff, isn't on screen for very long and, in his climactic scene, merely relates to Tess Harper an unilluminating dream he had last night.But, although I didn't always know what was going on, what OUGHT to come next, I will assume that the Coen brothers did and accept the film as projecting some kind of coherent philosophy about life -- even if that philosophy goes something like: ""Chance, the fall of a coin, plays such an important role in life that any coherent philosophy about it is impossible."" Very briefly, a young Texan (Josh Brolin) hunting deer stumbles on the aftermath of a drug double-cross. The ground is strewn with bodies. Ignoring the pleas of a wounded man for water, Brolin pokes around and finds a bag filled with half a million or so dollars and makes off with the satchel. He packs off his wife and mother-in-law to safety, but a transponder is concealed in the satchel, allowing Javier Bardem to follow him around and engage in the occasional shoot out. Bardem, with his incongruously saintly eyes, is one of those killers who is impossible to stop. He's like Schwarzenegger's robot in ""Terminator"" or any one of a dozen other stereotypes. Tommy Lee Jones is Tom Bell, the disillusioned sheriff who tracks Brolin in an attempt to save him, and fails. Barry Corbin makes a brief appearance as an ex-lawman with even less optimism than Jones, who lives in a dump even messier and more thoroughly debauched than my own.There are other familiar faces in the cast (Tess Harper, Woody Harrelson) but what sticks in the mind are the bit parts -- the elderly Texan in the isolated gas station, for instance, whose life apparently depends on whether a tossed quarter falls heads up. He seems to have been plucked at random from the streets of Alpine. Or Brolin's mother-in-law, Beth Grant, a garrulous woman with terminal cancer. When a man offers to carry her luggage to the station, she comments, ""Well, there's at least one gentleman left in west Texas."" But then she adds, ""You don't often see a Mexican wearing a suit."" This is a darker story than the Coen's ""Fargo."" ""Fargo"" had one psychopath and one low-level thug, and the rest were ordinary characters with weaknesses. In this film, the greedy and murderous outnumber the good. But, I suppose, following the novel, the blame isn't pinned on regional character. One frazzled sheriff tells Jones that it's all the drug money and the kids with green hair. Jones replies with ambiguous insincerity that he gave up hope when kids stopped using ""sir"" and ""ma'am"" as terms of address. The story certainly STARTS with drug money but then it seems to move on inexorably from there, turning into a contest of wills mediated by accident. A flirtatious young woman at a motel pool asks Brolin why he's always looking out the window. ""Oh, just to see what's comin'."" And she says, ""You never see what's comin'."" How right she is. A car running a stop sign when you're not paying attention can ruin your life.At any rate, the Coens have done for the values, people, and landscape of southwest Texas what they did for snowbound Minnesota in ""Fargo."" In Texas, if you want a gun you walk in and buy it. The majority of folks are given to categorical thinking but aren't unkind. And the landscape is raw and arid, no country for old men, not anymore.It's a pretty good film. The Coens are among the most original writers and directors working today.","

"Doylenf","25 October 2008","I have to give NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN a very mixed review.For the most part, I agree that NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a well executed crime drama, patterned somewhat after the much better written FARGO, in which the central character was a female officer. Here, it's a male sheriff (TOMMY LEE JONES) given to some armchair psychiatry aimed at trying to understand what makes today's western civilization (or lack of it) tick. He gets no answer from the script.Nor do we get a satisfying ending to a story that is full of grim menace supplied by its main character (JAVIER BARDEM) who goes around dispensing with almost every member of the supporting cast.Nor do the characters act in a way that makes common sense. This is the main trouble with the script. WOODY HARRELSON, for example, seems to walk meekly to his final destiny with the casual air of a man unalarmed by the situation after warning JOSH BROLIN (a man on the run) that he's up against a man who simply wants blood. Likewise, Brolin's wife accepts her fate meekly after stating that she ""knew"" the killer would show up on her doorstep.It's taut with suspense most of the time with only a few spots that drag, but it's the inconsistencies of certain characters that gave the script some flaws, as well as a general lack of humor which made the dark happenings in FARGO more bearable.The biggest letdown is the dry ending with no justice for the guilty man and Tommy Lee Jones describing a dream that has nothing to do with the events we just witnessed. Period. The End.The very flat ending is the weakest part of all. But the performances of JAVIER BARDEM, TOMMY LEE JONES and especially JOSH BROLIN in a very unusual role for him, make the film eminently worth watching.","

"jcbutthead86","15 January 2013","No Country For Old Men is a flawless masterpiece of cinema that combines amazing acting,great direction,a wonderful screenplay and memorable characters. This is one of the Coen Brothers best films,one of my all-time favorite films and one of the greatest films ever made.Based on Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name and set in West Texas in 1980,No Country For Old Men tells the story of a hunter named Lleweyln Moss(Josh Brolin)who comes across a drug deal gone bad and finds two million dollars in a briefcase. Even though he has the money,Lleweyln knows he's not safe and has to find a way out while being tracked by a dangerous hit-man named Anton Chigurh(Jarvier Bardem),local county sheriff Ed Tom Bell(Tommy Lee Jones)and Mexican drug dealers all leading up to a violent and bloody chase and cat and mouse game.NCFOM is a masterpiece that works not just as Crime Thriller,but,also works as a Coen Brothers film,character study,the study on the themes of life,death and fate and as a Contemporary Western. What I love about NCFOM is that while it is a Coen Brothers film,at times it doesn't feel like one because of the way the Coens approach the story. Unlike most of the Coens films,where violence and chaos are done with loud sounds and a music score,this film has a very quiet and somber demeanor,giving us a world of the Texas landscape where violence and chaos is almost silent and unheard and where no character is safe. The Action and Violence in the film are well-done with suspense and intensity and the fact that there is no music during the Action scenes adds to the film's greatness and puts you on the edge of your seat. The Action and violence in the film is bloody and dark and will disturb you to the core. The screenplay by The Coens is excellent,adapting McCarthy's dialog word for word right out of the book,with The Coens still bringing some of their signature style and sense of humor and wit to the script. The movie is a great character study as well,with the three main character Ed Tom,Anton and Llewelyn in the forefront. The three main characters are well-developed and memorable,each of them having great scenes on their own and as the film goes on you understand their motivations,who they are and who they're about,whether it's Llewelyn and the money,Anton Chigurh and his pursuit of the money and Ed Tom reactions to the things he sees all around him. What sets NCFOM from other crime Thrillers is the film's study of Life,death and fate. Life,death and fate seem to either effect or goes with the characters,with Anton Chigurh who is basically a physical representation of death and fate. Chigurh strongly believes in fate and uses a coin to find out whether you die or not,if you guess heads or tails,one or the other right,you live,if you don't you will die at the hands of Chigurh. The gas station scene in the film will show you. Where Llewelyn is trying to defend himself from violence and death,Sheriff Ed Tom just doesn't understand why there's violence all around and why the times are changing all around him,with drugs,guns and death in the air. Ed Tom represents the past where old time sheriff's didn't have to use a gun or deal with violence,the future in this film is drugs,guns,death and the real danger and Horror of violence,something that Ed Tom Bell doesn't understand and can't figure out why it's happening and there is a sadness and dread that hangs over the film with Ed Tom and the title No Country For Old Men refers to him. NCFOM is also a modern Western in many respects and while we don't see any stagecoaches and six-shooters,you will see characters riding horses and wearing cowboy hats and Roger Deakins beautiful photography shows viewers the dust and dirt of West Texas making look beautiful and nice during the day while making the film dark and eerie at night. The ending of the film will divide viewers and will fall into two categories people who love the ending or who will hate the ending,I fall into the former category because the Coens while staying true to their vision,also stay true to the vision of McCarthy's novel offering viewers a powerful and unforgettable conclusion that doesn't end with a bang,but with a whimper and one of the reasons NCFOM is a Masterpiece.The whole cast is excellent in their roles. Josh Brolin is does a great job as Llewelyn Moss bringing a grit and toughness to the role. Jarvier Bardem is brilliant as Anton Chigurh,one of the best villains in movie history. Bardem is frightening,scary and menacing and doesn't try to be scary,he just is. Tommy Lee Jones is wonderful as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell,bringing a quiet,somber and sometimes dry humor to the performance. Woody Harrelson does good job as Carson Wells,an associate of Anton Chigurh. Kelly Macdonald does a fine job as Llewelyn's wife Carla Jean Moss and considering Macdonald's Scottish in real life does a good job with the Texas accent. Garret Dillahunt(Wendell),Tess Harper(Loretta Bell),Barry Corbin(Ellis),Stephen Root(Man who hires Wells)and Beth Grant(Carla Jean's Mother)give fine performances as well.The Coen Brothers(Joel and Ethan)direction in the film is excellent and the Coens give the film great pace and timing,while giving film a great since of atmosphere and tone,always moving the camera. Brilliant direction Joel and Ethan.The score by Carter Burwell is rarely heard in the film,but when in use is effective and fits with the mood of the film. Fine score.In final word,if you love Crime Thrillers,Drama,character study's,Western,The Coen Brothers,Cormac McCarthy or cinema,I suggest you see No Country For Old Men,an absolute Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again and is one of The Coen Brothers Best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.j","

"estebangonzalez10","16 September 2010","The best Coen movie since Fargo! Javier Bardem gives a terrifying performance as Anton Chigurh. From the opening scene we are introduced to this morbid character who has the coolest weapon I have seen for a villain in any movie. There is a lot of silence in the film which adds to the tension and thrills. The dialogue is excellent and philosophical at times. Tommy Lee Jones narration is great as he realizes no matter how hard he tries he cant change the evil in the world after he had maintained order as a sheriff in his small and quiet town in west Texas. The movie begins and ends with Jones narration. In the opening narrative he tells the story of a boy he sent to the electric chair who had killed his 14 year old girlfriend for no apparent reason. This narration sets the tone for the entire movie as we are introduced to Anton, a evil man who kills without hessitation. The abrupt ending has a lot to do with what Jones has been saying since the beginning of the movie. His final narration deals with the issue of the impossibility of understanding these evil characters and feels all he has done has been in vain. Great film which lives up to its predecessor, Fargo. Well deserved win for best picture of the year!","

"dromasca","30 September 2008","I do like the Coen brothers movies, including some of the previous ones which were not commercial successes and were not so well received by the critics. Surprsingly, it is this film which seems to be universally acclaimed by critics and received high enough grades to make it in the IMDb Top 100 that left me with a partial feeling of un-satisfaction.On the good side the film really catches the attention with a strong visual style, and with a sophisticated structure which makes the multiple cat-and-mouse games played by the characters extremely enjoyable. It also allows for a tremendous performance by Javier Bardem for which he received a well-deserved Oscar, and another solid one from tommy Lee Jones - he may be somehow stereotypically cast lately, but he fits so well in the stereotype and becomes better as he gets older like god whiskey I dare say :-) On the bad side the film tries to play a little too much on the over-smartness side. I did not read the book, so I was left to guess key pieces of the action, and yes, life is full of mysteries, but I could detect no logic in how the Coen brothers decided what to leave out - these just looked like intentional wholes in the plot, obviously intentional because these guys know too well how to tell a story. The ending which was intended to be symmetrical with the beginning was supposed to give a different perspective to the whole story, but it did not really make me vibrate either. It is maybe because the combination of the genres of violent gangsters conflict, greed and hate motivated pursuits and the western setting do not really rime in my mind with the kind of philosophy Tommy Lee Jones' character was articulating in words at the end. Some more simplicity would have yielded into an even better film, IMHO.","

"drjhcrow","12 January 2008","I am not sure I have a spoiler in here or not because the movie is rotten (aka spoiled). With high expectations this time I was disappointed by these two brothers once again.The plot is simple (Okay). A loser finds a killing field, a truckload of dope, and a lawyers case full of money. He leaves the scene only to return with water for one thirsty, dying Mexican. This part is fine and the stage is set for a good movie. He is found on the scene by the guys wanting the money but escapes. He leaves his pickup behind so he is easy to find. He leaves town and gets his wife out of his quarters as well. A psychopathic, indestructible killer comes into the movie about now and has his first killing spree. From here on the movie is not real at all but some reasonable parts are thrown in and some of the acting is, in fact good by everyone but the maniac. By this time though I am thinking I am also a maniac for staying to see this film.There is a continuing chase that is non-sensical except for the fact that the money has a transponder tucked inside to make it easy to track him and the cash. The real chances of this working as shown in the movie defy logic but this is a movie so I will calm down a bit.What is nuts is the fact that just about anyone can find this guy and there are about 60 coincidences that make the whole thing ridiculous. Every step results in killing fiesta. In the end a few stars come into the movie - this is to give the Coen's film pseudo endorsements and sell the picture and it seems to have worked because the mindless have given it high ratings and even I went to see it.In the end the blood keeps a coming and there is no justice or sense of style anywhere to be seen. This is sort of a ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Halloween"" for adults with 70 IQ's and below. The acting is okay but who with a brain could care when there is no reason for the film itself.I guess that gives everyone my opinion. What junk. Speaking of ""spoilers"" this did the Coens in once and for all for me. Never again will they get a dime of my cash.JHC","

"Poseidon-3","8 February 2008","Based on a popular novel of the same name, this suspenseful character study traces the actions of three men tangled in a mess of stolen drug money, vengeance and pursuit. Brolin plays a low-income husband in 1980 Texas who, while hunting, comes upon the remnants of a drug deal gone bad. He discovers $2 million and takes off with it, but makes the mistake of returning to the scene later. Before he can even count the money, he's being pursued by various parties to the crime, primarily the driven, sociopathic and mysterious Bardem as a vicious hired killer. Attempting to sort out the mess, alternately trying to save Brolin and stop Bardem (who leaves a trail of bodies in his wake), is Jones, an aging sheriff who is finding his profession more and more futile. Brolin and Bardem play a very dangerous game of cat and mouse with Bardem stalking him through location after location and carrying one mean weapon, a pneumatic cattle gun that can knock the locks off of doors with one trigger pull. Jones uses Brolin's wife Macdonald to try to get him to give himself up, drawing her into the situation as well. Harrelson appears as another hit man, sent to retrieve the money for his own client Root. Brolin gives a terrific everyman performance, placing himself in a new category in the Hollywood echelon. He's a simple, stoic man with an ironic sense of integrity who makes a few wrong decisions. It's interesting to watch his resourcefulness unfold as his predicament worsens. Jones feels tailor-made for his role and effortlessly slips into the character's skin. It's an interesting counterpoint to the dogged and ferocious agent he portrayed years ago in ""The Fugitive."" Bardem is captivating and quite terrifying. His intensity, which contains just the slightest hint of dark humor, is amazing to behold. This exceedingly handsome actor is made to look almost ridiculous and yet he is a serious force to be reckoned with. His interchanges with various townsfolk and travelers are fascinating and tense to watch. Harrelson has almost a cameo role, but handles it effectively. Macdonald starts out seeming weak, but manages to turn in a memorable portrayal by the time of the dénouement. Harper appears briefly as Jones' supportive wife. They make a believable couple. Cute Dillahunt plays a green deputy, exchanging ideas about criminology with Jones as they investigate. Corbin has a small but effective bit part as a local man with a violent event in his past. Grant, humorously, but almost too cartoonishly, plays Macdonald's crotchety mother. A wondrous collection of actors gives quirky life to a variety of rural store owners, motel clerks and the like. The film has atmosphere and tension throughout. Surprisingly, but refreshingly, there is no music to speak of in the main course of the film. It avoids the traditional use of music which instructs the audience what to feel and when. Destined to be considered slow by some viewers, it takes its time to set the right moods and give full texture to the story and characters. Though many folks have lambasted the film for its inconclusive ending, it follows the book to a remarkable degree, up to and including the ending. Ultimately, it's a movie more memorable for its acting and its imagery rather than its plot line.","

"stillworkingfortheknife","5 January 2013","This is actually one of the best book adaptions ever. It's almost impossible to tell a story accurately with such little dialogues and without a narrator voice, but the Coen brothers accomplished it fantastically. A perfect cast till minor roles and Javier Bardem makes one of the best film villains of all time! The style of the film is absolutely unique and the mixture of western, thriller and satire is excellent. The ending is realistic and leaves a couple of questions open, which makes you think a lot about the film afterwards. Everything seems sophisticated, even how scenes succeed on one another and that's what is so fantastic about this movie. Everything that happens in No Country For Old Men keeps your eyes peeled on the TV screen, even if it's just normal dialogue. I.e. the showdown between Chigurh and Moss, which is one of the most thrilling scenes I've seen lately or the Chigurh's conversation with the gas station proprietor which is absolutely awesome. The screenplay, the direction and Javier Bardem totally deserved the Oscar. There were better movies in 2006 but this flick is a very favorable tale about bad people that is both confusing and stunning.","

"filmtravel101","4 December 2007","If this movie didn't have the Coen brothers name attached to it, or any of these brilliant actors, any person paying 10 bucks would surely have walked out of this b movie violent film - yet it shows how desperate people are for any entertainment these days.I have to agree with Jonathan Rosenbaum from the Chicago Reader, who ""admired the film's aesthetics, yet questioned its moral culpability: the Coens expend great energy on depicting horror, while encouraging us to ""hypocritically shake our heads at the sadness of it all"".It is with great disappointment i say that the Coen brothers have not really risen to any level with this over priced b movie budget that is not listed anywhere for obvious reasons... if it was done for say 5M than perhaps it would do it justice as a campy amateur festival movie. And the story has some great one liners and funny moments, but overall was a slow dull story line almost like Terminator meets Dusk/Dawn - and most of all -an implausible main character making a 'mistake' that he even says.. is probably a dumb idea' as a typical class A foreshadowing of the rest of the movie. Like some guy is going to find 2M in cash and go and return to the crime scene out of a 'conscious awakening' and give a dying Mexican thug - a jug of water.. give me a break. He would be in Vegas spending it like a rock star or donating it to charity or police. The saddest part is the message the film sends out and that is what really bothered me throughout this overtly, way-over-the-top violent film - but if you like their old films like Blood Simple perhaps you'll enjoy this back to their roots film but it nothing new or fresh. I gave it a 1 for effort and nothing more.... surely it will become a cult classic but did not walk away with anything from Cannes for a good reason. simply put. just more Americano over the top crap.","

"merrywood","27 January 2008","The Coen Bros. are laughing all the way to the bank. Many critics often rave about products that are incoherent but somehow have the appearance of lucidity. These critics certainly do not want anyone to know they have been snookered. No Country for Old Men is perhaps the crowning achievement for this ""tongue-in-cheek"" crowd.Here we have a film that builds up to great expectation with meticulously crafted tension and extraordinary production values, casting and performances but in the first part of the third act simply stops. Strong characters rendered by actors in good performances are either killed or hinted at being killed with no scenaric detail. The killer whose enigmatic character has become magnetic simply drives off into the horizon suffering only a broken arm in a mindless car accident. Cosmic intervention or comic relief? The overall feeling is that the Coens ran out of budget but one can also strongly suspect that it might be that they decided to simply screw the audience and see if they could get away with it in a bizarre and sinister mind-set perhaps borne of some kind of chemical or psychological overdose. In any event at this writing it appears that they have, especially with eight Oscar nominations, at least for a great number of fans and critics not yet sure of themselves.The movie is about as fulfilling and satisfying as being stood-up by an important romantic date for which one has spent half a day preparing. The level of impact and effect then depends upon one's level of masochistic personality, sense of self or overall intelligence.","

"MLDinTN","16 September 2008","I'm not sure what all the hype about this movie was for. It was very average at best. The only interesting thing about it was Javier Bardem, whom played psychotic killer,Anton Chigurh. Chigurh is so cold blooded, has no conscience about killing and lets his victims choose their fate by a coin flip. Chigurh is chasing Moss because he stole millions from a drug deal gone bad. Chigurh is able to find him first because there is a tracker with the money. But after Moss barely escapes, I didn't get how Chigurh kept finding him since there was no tracker. Also, a small town sheriff is hot on their trail but is always a step behind.The ending was a disappointment. The movie never explained how Moss was tracked to the hotel. Also was the money ever found. And how did Chigurh escape the motel room right before the sheriff went in. Too much info was left out.FINAL VERDICT: It was average. Nothing great. And I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to see a great character in Chigurh.","

Javier is a brilliant actor, but he just seems to do everything in slow motion in this film. Is it just me or does the acting seem very, very laidback - almost lazy?The entire film I was rooting for the protagonist, who is then suddenly killed off screen. Uhm, why? The ending is very abrupt and leaves way too many questions unanswered. It leaves you with a sense of 'what the hell'!?","

"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","27 February 2008","Movies that stimulate plenty of discussion about whether they are good or bad or awful are probably movies that should be seen more than once. I had that feeling after seeing films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.' Not much really happens in those movies and they have a lengthy runtime. Kubrick's film has 88 minutes of no dialog. That's like making a feature length film and not having any spoken dialog, and by today's standards (even 1968 standards) that is odd. The Coen Brothers' latest film has that quality to it. Not a whole lot happens for large parts of the film.The fact of the matter is that not a whole SEEMS to happen. Take one of the opening scenes as Llewelyn sees the man sitting underneath the tree. He looks at him, nothing. He looks again, nothing. He moves in closer, rifle trained, nothing. He sees the man has bled. The bag next to the dead body has money, a lot of money. So he takes it. Aesthtically, not much happens as Llewelyn just warily approaches the tree. Mentally, however, is where the action is. Llewelyn is part afraid, part curious, but being cautious enough to keep his wits and try not to get killed. Obviously from the previous scene we see that the money in question is a hot item and a good deal of people died for it.In today's special effects drenched age people seem to have completely forgotten what real tension and suspense is. It is not a huge wall of fire (a la 'Independence Day') coming at you, but what is going through your head when you see that wall of fire coming. With this film, the Coens have put the tension in an intentionally bare landscape in order to show as little aesthetic flair as possible. This amplifies the psychological impact and suspense as there seems to be nowhere for Llewelyn to hide from a killer who also seems to appear from nowhere. Call it a MacGuffin technique or whatever floats your boat.The film is also highly more symbolic than the typical movie of today. Many things are implied, not actually shown. Much of the dialog and situations are allegorical (or applicable) to things much more general than a search for dirty money. Thus, this isn't a film solely for entertainment, which is what people want today (many people, not all). This is a film that first and foremost attempts to stimulate thought like '2001' and 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.' The abundant discussion here about whether it was good or bad or boring or pointless pretty much seems to confirm just that. People are talking about it. Whether it is out of frustration of praise is almost incidental, since it only confirms that the Coens achieved their goal. Maybe soon we'll see a director(s) make an actual film in response to this one. That is what living art is all about - it acts and reacts, just like its characters. --- 9/10Rated R for violence.

"DKosty123","3 May 2008","There are often times when a dark novel becomes a screen play & a film and the latter do not remain faithful to the novel. This is one of those occasions.There is some great acting by Tommy Lee Jones & several of the cast members. Some of the West Texas Scenery & settings are breath taking. The trouble is this film degrades in another (warning spoiler) new version of Jason going on a needless/meaningless killing spree. This means a new version of s slasher film just won best picture last year, & Hollywood thinks this exercise is intellectual. Oscar blew this one, as it is well produced, splendidly acted trash.The Coens got a big reputation with earlier films like Fargo. This film is no where near that one. There are 3 main characters who keep looking for and missing each other throughout the film. Upon further review, it appears what is tried for in this film is irony. The ending is done for intellectual effect but it makes no sense. Tommy Lee Jones cop should have been smart enough to be at the widows house to meet this version of Jason. It does show some parallels between this version and the folks in pursuit of him.After viewing this, I'd read the novel before looking at it again. The film has an open ended finish that makes no sense (or for sequels like Jason?). If you like guns, blood, & senseless maniac violence this is a film for you.If you want smart intellect, watch Fargo. There are few fine moments in this, but this is not a Best Picture that will be remembered 30 years from now. It is a slasher film which won best picture. That is indeed amazing.","

"raypdaley182","20 July 2008","I'd like to rank this amongst some of the worst films I've ever seen. Imagine a 3 hour long film with no introduction or ending, in other words your only watching the middle of a film.The film is very difficult to follow, characters are never really established enough for you to get to know them or feel any affinity for them. The only real known names in the film are Tommy Lee Jones playing Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (who you hardly ever see) & Woody Harrelson playing Carson Wells (who is in no more than 5 scenes). The main characters are Javier Bardem playing Anton Chigurh (who I've never heard of) & Josh Brolin (playing Llewelyn Moss) who is only famous for being the son of James Brolin.Some how this pile of rubbish managed to win 4 Academy Awards (Best Picture which made me laugh - it must have been up against some right utter trash, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay which is also laughable because essentially all they did was film the book this movie is based on & it also won best supporting actor for Javier Bardem) and I wondered if the Acedmy were watching the same movie I was.If the book is the same as the film then I'm surprised it was ever made into a movie as it's a very poor story indeed. The basic idea is good enough, that a man accidentally finds money & drugs after a drug sale goes wrong & everyone involved gets killed. Moss doesn't want the drugs but he does take the money but the people who were behind buying the drugs want their money back.Basically the rest of the film is a chase movie from that point onwards with Moss & everyone close to his life being pursued by the man hired to retrieve the money by the people who were buying the drugs who is killing anyone in his way on the journey.Ed Tom Bell is the local sheriff from the town near where the drug sale went wrong & he is tracking Chigurh who is searching for the money stolen by Moss. The pursuit is long & violent, pretty mindless and quite boring. You can't just expect a movie to be good because 1 guy is killing a lot of people, it has to have an actual story or protagonists you know & care about.And thats where the movie suffers, never knowing enough about Moss's character. With Bell we at least get a bit of insight into who he is from his voice-overs & scenes with his wife & employees but he's not the lead or even the 2nd lead character & we never get told enough about either of them. We learn almost nothing about Chigurh's character, only a short scene where Wells is hired to find & stop Chigurh (even the reasons behind this are never fully explained).The ending of the movie is also very weak & difficult to understand. Apparently Moss is killed (I didn't even realise this, thats how hard the film is to follow!), we never know if Moss's wife lives or what happens to the money. We never know how Moss's mother in law dies, who hit Chigurh's car & why.The film ends very badly, Chigurh walking away from a car accident & Bell wondering how he'll pass the time now he has retired.Not recommended as there is no start or actual end to the movie.","

"jordan2240","22 November 2007","I've seen all of the Coen Bros. films, and have had no trouble following the story-lines - until now. I was left with far too many questions in the end to give this film a high rating. I tried to like it, given it's critical reviews, but found portions of it rather boring, and also couldn't figure out how certain characters got involved in the story at all. They often seemingly appeared out of nowhere, leaving you to ponder who they were and what relationship they had to other characters as the movie rolled on. And the ending has been well-documented. I would guess most viewers basically zone out at that point anticipating the next bit of action, and the next bit of action is the credits scrolling by. Fargo and The Big Lebowski remain on top of my Coen Bros. list, with No Country perhaps bringing up the rear. I have no trouble with movies that reqire some thought, but am not a big fan of those that simply try to confuse you.","

"Sandcooler","8 March 2010","This movie took a while to really get into, but once I did I was pretty overwhelmed. It isn't a classic fight between the good and the bad, it's more like a brilliant cat-and-mouse game between the unlikeable and the even more unlikeable. I felt bad for Llewellyn Moss, who had no idea about how far over his head he was, but he's mostly the hero because of the contrast with Anton Chigurh. Chigurh is the unstoppable evil, which is mainly apparent in the gas station scene, in which he decides the clerk's fate in a coin toss. It's so random, it has nothing to do with the main plot, but he wants to kill him because he can. That's the frightening thing about Chigurh, he does bad things for no reason. It's a brilliant character, and his cold-blooded antics give the movie a breakneck pace. The pseudo-intellectual ending scene is an anti-climax, but that's pretty much the only criticism I can give.","

"lewiskendell","12 July 2010","""You can't stop what's coming. It ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity.""Even if No Country for Old Men didn't have gorgeous cinematography, excellent pacing, a near perfect script, and an absolutely perfect cast, I still would have loved it for its tone. It's the most similar movie to Fargo that the Coens have done, and the similar theme of implacable and unfathomable violence in a rural American area (once again initiated by money) is one of the main reasons why I love the Coens so much.The breathtaking, empty setting of south Texas is a seamless compliment to the measured pace of the movie. No Country has suspense coming out of its ears, as each scene seems to somehow surpass the previous ones in measured tension. The overall quiet of the film only serves to magnify the eventual scenes of violence when they come, and the fact that you don't see everything happen on-screen keeps the viewer fully invested in the story. There's no constant quick cuts and hyper-kinetic camera work to be seen; only long-smoldering sequences that pushes your anticipation to the brink of breaking, and then pushes it some more.In a cast this good, two people stand out even beyond the others. Tommy Lee Jones as the world-weary sheriff who's the heart of the story, and Javier Bardem as the relentless, inscrutable, main antagonist of the story. Jones was perfect, there's no other way for me to say it. And Bardem gives life to the best and most interesting villain since The Operative in Serenity. Both performances were among the best that I've seen in my life.No County for Old Men is the kind of movie that improves with every viewing. Ten years from now, I'll still be watching it and loving it.  It's film-making at its finest. When you take an amazing story and marry it to directors with immeasurable talent and a cast that couldn't have been better chosen, you get a masterpiece.","

"Red_Identity","2 October 2009","No Country For Old Men was deserving of all the praise and awards it got back in 2007. While I did root for other films of that year to win Best Picture, like Atonement or There Will Be Blood, with a repeat viewing of NCFOM, this is just under those films, if not right on par with them. The screenplay is very meaningful and thought-provoking as it is tense and thrilling. This is a Western thriller, a subtle but very absorbing film. The lack of a soundtrack really adds to the film's tension, and we are more concentrated on all of the little things that happen. The Coen brothers have only made one other film in the past that had really surprised me, and that was Fargo. While I still am not sure which is better, I think both are Masterpieces and deserve to be classics for years to come.The performances in the film are strong. Most notably, Javier Bardem. His performance won him an Oscar, and very deserved. He gives a creepy and subtly controlled performance, and makes a villain like no other since Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs (and since then, Heath Ledger has also joined that list). Kelly Macdonald and Tommy Lee Jones were also pretty amazing, the former giving one of my favorite supporting female performances of 2007. Josh Brolin is strong, but his role requires less of a big acting challenge than Jones or even Macdonald I would think. Woody Harrelson was great in his small screen time, and he made the best of it. The cinematography is perfect, as you would think from the guy who also shot the amazingly beautiful The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.What I also love about this film is that simple meaning of violence in this country. The film's opening monologue by Jones, and his closing scene proves that this really was his story, and also the reason for the unresolved plots. While I was one of the few that was frustrated by the final scene in the film, I can truly appreciate it now. No Country For Old Men is a great film, powerful and absorbing!","

"gandalf_theWise14","11 August 2019","I wanted to love No Country for Old Men. After seeing that it won best picture and best director, I thought it would be amazing. However, I only found it to be good, certainly nowhere near the ""masterpiece"" that some claim it to be.I found the biggest issue with the movie to be the plot. It doesn't all necessarily make sense, and in the end seems incredibly pointless. Josh Brolin's character, Llewelyn Moss, stumbles across a drug deal that had gone terribly wrong, and he appeared to be the only one alive on the scene to take the now unsupervised two million dollars. He takes the money for himself, which leads to an incredibly bloody hunt Javier Bardem's character Anton Chigurh leads in an attempt to get the money from Moss for the people who had hired him. This is the basic plot of the film. Chigurh, however, is a complete psychopath who essentially kills for fun. So, the longer the chase goes on, the larger the body count. The plot, however, seems to wander quite a bit, and seems more focused on how sadistic and twisted Chigurh is, rather than the actual story that was set up. It seems to me that the plot is just there to get us from one bloody scene to the next, and is just an excuse for all of the extreme and excessive violence. If the film was more focused on the plot, it could have made for a much more interesting film, though it still dod end up having many intriguing moments.We also have so, so many things going on at once in this movie. Outside of the main plot, we have Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Bell, who is tracking this case as well as questioning his purpose at this point in his career. This, of course, leads to many sentimental moments as he thinks about the amount of violence going on that he is unable to stop (he is just a little late on the crime scene several times in this film, and unable to prevent the violence). It felt like this part of the movie was slightly disconnected from the rest, and though it provides some thought-provoking messages, it doesn't really justify its inclusion in the film. We also get Woody Harrelson's character showing up later in the movie, who seems to be against both Chigurh and Moss. We don't spend much time with him before he is just another one of Chigurh's victims, though. He really only showed up to give both Moss and the audience an idea of just how bad Chigurh is. Other than that, there isn't much of a purpose for his character in the film. As you can see, the movie gets sidetracked from it's actual plot in so many ways and is just overloaded with plot points and characters that don't necessarily add anything of value to the film.I have to say, the film's ending was the biggest disappointment and made me question the point of the movie in the first place. It takes a wild turn in the final half hour when Moss is suddenly killed. This is for some reason off-screen, and just doesn't make sense for the movie at all. With that, the movie is basically over, but then there's more, because of course it's not good enough to just kill Moss, his wife must die as well. Oh, and her mom. A depressed Bell retires after realizing there's simply nothing he can do against the violence that he tried so hard to prevent. And then, for no particular reason, Chigurh gets in a brutal car crash, and then just... walks away? At this point I'd given up on any kind of closing for this movie, but then we get the strangest ending ever: Bell talking to his wife about his odd dreams. So many people have talked about the ""deep meanings"" behind all these moments, but that's not what I got out of it at all. Instead, I just sat there confused. Nothing about the end of the movie made sense, and I just sat there wondering what the previous hour and 40 minutes or so was for in the first place, as it didn't seem to matter at the end.The directing style of the film is slow, gritty, and intense, from the dialogue to the way it's shot. This sometimes works well enough, but the movie can often feel a bit lifeless. This feeling is further enhanced by the lack of music in the film, which doesn't seem to have the same effect they intended it to have, and just ends up making it feel dull. Still, I mostly enjoyed the directing of this movie, and there was some great cinematography through it all, but I just couldn't help but feel that it was lacking something that might give it more life.I have to say, the suspense scenes is this movie were excellent. The camera angles and lack of sound except for tiny noises were perfectly executed and have you on the edge of your seat the entire scene. There are many sequences just like this that work really well.The acting in this film is nothing short of outstanding. Josh Brolin gives a very strong performance in what I would say is the leading role (though it's hard to really say). He is perfectly believable as his character, who is selfish and not entirely likable, but just enough so that we want him to survive the terrible situation he's in. Javier Bardem is incredible and gives an unsettling sense of realism to his psychopathic character. He is a genuinely menacing villain that strikes fear into the audience. Tommy Lee Jones is also very believable in his role as the aging sheriff questioning the future of his career. Woody Harrelson gives a great performance as well, albeit with much less screen time than those mentioned above. Overall, the all-star cast does not disappoint.No Country for Old Men is overall a solid film, though slightly overrated. It is far from the spectacular film I have heard many claim it to be, thanks to an overall lifeless feel to the movie, an unfocused plot, and a largely disappointing ending. However, the direction, suspense, and acting were all spectacular, and the villain was incredibly menacing and well-written. Through all this, the film ends up being good despite the several problems it has.","

"charchuk","25 November 2007","This is probably the definition of a film you have to watch twice. I don't really feel like I can do it justice after just one viewing, especially one in a noisy theatre, full of restless teens, next door to Fred Claus being played at full volume. As such, the lack of music really stands out and the delicate dialogue is difficult to decipher at times. Furthermore, from a purely movie-going experience, the dark ending feels unsatisfactory, and I know that I have to watch the film again, forgoing the narrative, in order to fully understand it. As it stands now, though, it's one of the very best films of the year.A lot of people seem to be complaining about the Tommy Lee Jones subplot, and of course everyone has something to say about that ending. I don't think these two are unrelated. On the surface, this storyline seems extraneous, taking away from the extremely intense main story. The constant asides to Bell and his deputy's investigation seem only an attempt to explain the events that are happening, but as nothing is ever fully explained, this subplot seems useless. I don't necessarily agree with this. Bell - his opening narration and final thoughts especially - seem to be a representation of the thematic element of the story, whereas the Llewellyn/Chigurh story is an affirmation of these themes. I'm not sure if I've got a full grasp on everything the film is saying - there's definitely ideas about morality, violence, money, death, and the changing world thrown about - but I got enough to know that multiple viewings are required. And I'm looking forward to it.Of course, one can not ignore the utterly thrilling and exceptionally shot main storyline, which, at least up until Llewellyn's death, seems to be operating entirely within conventional, Hollywood standards. That's not to say it isn't incredibly effective. From the get-go, Chigurh is shown to be one of the most ruthless, calmest, inventive and downright terrifying villains in cinematic history. His unique appearance, his physical tics, his unusual choice of weapons, and his very precise manner of speaking combine to create a full, fleshed-out character - but as for portraying a human, well, that's another story. On the flip side, Brolin's quiet, reserved Llewellyn is the emotional core of the movie, making us feel for him even as he proves to be just as selfish and villainous as those chasing him. The conflict between the two is the highlight of the movie, from the terrifically tense cat-and-mouse chase in the first motel to the terrifically intense gun battle in the second one. Though there is no real physical payoff to these confrontations, I think the phone conversation between them - the one and only time they speak - is fitting enough. Both characters receive their retributions in other ways, which is the perfect capper to the conflict. Though their ends may be narratively unfulfilling, I think they work flawlessly thematically.One must not forget about the fantastic technical aspect when reviewing this film, either. The lack of music is very stark and though makes the scenes much more suspenseful and scary, as there's no musical cue to tell us when to be frightened. Tied in to this, the use of sound in this movie is impeccable, and may be even more effective than the visuals. The scene where Chigurh finds where Llewellyn is hiding while the latter waits for him is accomplished almost entirely through the use of sounds - Chigurh's boots on the floor, the beeping of the transponder, the unscrewing of the lightbulb, the readying of his gas tank weapon. We, like Llewellyn, are forced to just listen, but we know what's going to happen next, making the inevitable that much scarier. Of course, as with every Coen film, the cinematography is stunning, and nearly every shot in this movie is stunning and artistically rich. The careful, eloquent nature of the dialogue that has become a staple of these brothers' films is utilized to full extent here, and as I said I need to see it again to take in everything. Overall, just a fantastic achievement.Even so, I couldn't help but be disappointed by that ending. It wasn't a ""that was it?"" response, where I felt something was left unexplained and I didn't know what happened. It was more of a ""oh, that's it"", where I just feel depressed and emotionally drained. There is no character redemption - even Bell, the most moral of the characters, is not left untouched - no plot threads being tied up, no happy ending. It's just a hopelessly dark finish. Of course, that fits in perfectly with the film's perspective on the world, so perhaps it's a great ending. I just couldn't see it that way.","

"Cosmoeticadotcom","1 September 2010","The film, as shown above, is often called a thriller or Gothic, but neither term really applies. It's not Gothic because it is too tied to the earthen landscape, and it's barely a thriller, because, well, it's so predictable. It's simply a monster movie- a bit more realistic than the Hannibal Lecter/Freddy Krueger sort, but not much. One wonders what the film would have been like if the assassin Chigurh had been more like the hit-man character played by Forest Whitaker in Ghost Dog: The Way Of The Samurai, Jim Jarmusch's underrated film about an assassin, which is also one of the most realistic depictions of organized crime on film. R, perhaps he could be more erratically real, like Johnny Boy, Robert De Niro's psychotic character from Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets, another realistic depiction of organized crime. Instead, what does Chigurh offer besides The Terminator and The Joker? Yes, another Batman foe, Two-Face's obsession with coin flipping to decide whether or not he commits murder. Perhaps in his construction of the novel, McCarthy thought that this device was somehow deep or profound, that it lent Chigurh the status of cosmic force of nature, but what it really did was explicitly tie the character down to a comic book level realism. And, incidentally, Two-Face was played by Jones in 1995's Batman Forever.But, to get back to the point I raised, the film is SO predictable. Do we not know how Chigurh's victims will end up? Do we not know that he will escape at the end, despite the bone of the car crash tossed in to make it seem like cosmic justice will out? Do we not know Moss is a dead man? That is wife is also a walking corpse? That Sheriff Bell will prove as incompetent as he is apathetic? And, I earlier mentioned the overrated Thomas Paul Anderson film, There Will Be Blood, but since both films so posture themselves on 'depth' in dealing with their amoral characters, it's a wonder why so few critics took these films to task for never truly delving into that amorality. Great, amoral characters- see Films, Slasher (20th Century). Yawn. Yet, of the two films, and even laden with its own considerable flaws, it still has some occasionally interesting moments wrought by the acting abilities of Daniel Day-Lewis (although that film's lead character is not amongst his best). Is there a single character in this film with a fifth of the complexity of Lewis's Daniel Plainview, even considering how thin that character is developed? No. Simple. No. And that is the same answer to give to the query over whether this film is worth rewatching.On to the DVD features. There are three disks- one to download a digital copy onto one's PC (thanks, I'll pass), then the disk with the film. Unfortunately, it lacks an audio commentary. One of the prime things a DVD has in its favor, as a mode of visual art, is the ability to feature commentaries on films, and barring a Woody Allen-like decision yo always forego such, it is incumbent upon DVD companies to include such, especially to supplement mediocre films like this. The disk also has a good making of featurette, a film on working with the Coen Brothers, and a small piece on Tommy Lee Jones' character. The final disk has a bevy of features: a tongue in cheek featurette shot by Josh Brolin, and a slew of clips regarding the promotion of the film over several months- from interviews to book store appearances to radio interviews. All in all, a decent bonus features package. But, the lack of audio commentary is glaring.As for the film itself, on the technical side, the cinematography by Roger Deakins is solid to good. At times the views of West Texas are very Antonionian, whereas, at others, little is made of perspective, framing, and editing. Carter Burwell's scoring leaves no impression, one way or the other. The acting is rather pedestrian- from the stilted Bardem to the so laid back he's barely acting Jones to the solid Brolin. And, as I opened this essay by stating, some things are better excerpted. This film's trailer is proof, for it is engaging, unlike the film. The last 15 or so minutes of the film, after Moss's death, are utterly superfluous, for they add nothing to the plot, which is the primum mobile of the film. The film would have been much better had its rather incisive portrayals of small town Texans and their quirks been given more screen time, and then a reduced scenario of the drug chase, with more realistic characters, were added to that brew. But, alack, this might require work, and thought, and too often, in Hollywood (including the vaunted Coen Brothers) these sorts of things simply cannot be bothered with. Instead, the small time characters flit in and out of this film with such rapidity that they are lucky that a few of them rise above stereotypes. Fair enough, I guess, if you consider film a business first. I consider it an art first, so be equally fair and give the Coens the same in return as they gave to their screenplay: don't bother with their film. After all, your time and money are as precious as any film investor's. No?","

"shanekraus","30 March 2022","This is possibly the coen brothers best movie. A very dark thriller that shows characters being hunted. Anton is one of the scariest, most evil characters ever. The first half of the movie ramps up the tension, but the second half is kind of disappointing. Plus, the ending does feel pretty abrupt and unfinished. Still, this is a greater dark thriller.","

"Woodyanders","12 June 2008","Shrewd, resourceful Vietnam veteran Llewelyn Moss (the excellent Josh Brolin) stumbles across a bunch of dead bodies, a pick-up full of heroin, and a bag with two million bucks worth of drug money in it. Moss decides to take the bag. This in turn makes Moss the target of vicious and remorseless psychopath Anton Chigurh (a splendidly chilling performance by Javier Bardem), who engages in a lethal game of cat and mouse with Moss. Meanwhile, cagey, weary Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (the always fine Tommy Lee Jones) investigates and tries to find Moss before it's too late. Joel and Ethan Coen have expertly crafted a tense, gripping and understated crime thriller that for the most part works like gangbusters: the sterling performances from a sturdy cast, the bleak, fatalistic tone, Roger Deakins' crisp, striking cinematography, the startling outbursts of shockingly brutal violence, several inspired moments of pitch black humor (the scene between Chigurh and a befuddled gas station proprietor is an amusingly edgy little gem), Carter Burwell's spare, moody score, the vivid evocation of the dusty, desolate rural terrain and the everyday folks who inhabit the region, the provocative central theme about a dying code of honor and decency, and a few well-staged action set pieces (a protracted shoot-out between Moss and Chugurh in the empty dark streets of a small town rates as a definite exciting highlight) are all uniformly spot-on. Brolin, Bardem, and Jones all shine in their meaty parts, with Barden especially memorable as one seriously scary and nasty villain. Moreover, there are nice supporting turns by Woody Harrelson as cocky, amiable hoodlum Carson Wells, Kelly McDonald as Moss' sweet, concerned wife Carla Jean, Garret Dillahunt as the eager Deputy Wendell, Tess Harper as Bell's sassy wife Loretta, and Barry Corbin as crusty, crippled old coot Ellis. WARNING: Possible *SPOILERS* ahead. However, the film really falters in the annoyingly vague and meandering last third. Moreover, Moss gets abruptly bumped off in a most frustrating and dissatisfying way. That criticism aside, this is still a highly impressive and engrossing winner.","

"l_rawjalaurence","9 November 2013","Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MAN is quite simply a joy to watch, as it continually frustrates our expectations of what kind of movie it is expected to be. Set in Texas, New Mexico and Mexico itself, it is a western that isn't a western; a chase film in which bad guy Anton Chigurh (Javier Badem) pursues Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), while being himself pursued by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones). One of those chases is resolved; the other is left hanging in the air. The film builds up a fair amount of suspense, as we wonder whether Chigurh and Bell are going to get their men, yet the Coen Brothers continually combine that suspense with an eye for telling detail, or the inclusion of quirky sequences designed to show the futility of the entire quest theme. One of my favorite quirky sequences takes place in a dirty roadside motel, where the camera cuts to a sign outside saying (""HBO Available""). The whole notion of cable television in this kind of motel seems particularly incongruous. The performances are simply brilliant: Bardem doesn't have a lot to say, but communicates everything through telling glances. By contrast Brolin seems more laid back, despite the fact that he is being continually pursued. Jones goes through the motions of ensuring that justice should be done, but seems to be looking for a quiet life all the time. It is significant that the dramatic tension slackens somewhat during his sequences. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is the kind of movie that befits repeated viewings in order to uncover its subtleties. A true modern classic.","

"drqshadow-reviews","26 March 2012","I hadn't seen this since it was in cinemas, and found that it's even better than I'd remembered. It's a very unusually-paced film, with a lot of long silences, seemingly-innocuous conversations and dangling plot threads that don't ultimately lead anywhere. In many instances that could make for some infuriating viewing, but in the Coen brothers' hands it all somehow comes together into a master tapestry. The word of the day is suspense, an emotion the brothers have excelled at in the past, and No Country is a glorious example of it at play. The film's three protagonists, retiring sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), stone-cold killer Chigurh (a terrifying, star-making turn for Javier Bardem) and land-living cowboy Moss (Josh Brolin), never actually meet face-to-face but the wake of ripples left in their dueling pursuits is enough to power several movies' worth of rich, intriguing material. Sweaty, intense action walks lockstep with outstanding characterization, top-notch dialog and a hearty dose of respect for the novel. Like many Coen classics, it gets better with each subsequent viewing.","

"Nog","27 December 2007","I am really surprised by the critics' admiration for this film. I am not so surprised at the reaction of the Tarantino fan types that have rated this film so highly on the IMDb. A film with this much graphic violence (I counted Anton's tally at 14, but maybe I missed some) better have some good points to make -- and any more, they should be NEW points -- or else it's just a horror film. I am afraid that the Coens have come up with a horror film. Okay, but then I don't understand how the critics can get so worked up (of course, I thought they were way too kind to Little Children also).Essentially, as some other readers have so rightly pointed out, this film is pointless. The insults of other readers --- that those of us who believe this are dumb --- doesn't hold water. I have discussed the film with a number of friends who are great fans of cinema (and I mean they have an appreciation of the classics of world cinema), and they also had to agree. And we are fans of the Coens, and feel that they make interesting films with great dialog, settings, acting, and photography. In fact, I cannot fault the film technically. The problem is with the story itself, which means that either Cormac McCarthy failed, or the Coens did in adapting it.So I invite other readers to explain what points are made here that we haven't already seen a zillion times in other films. The relentless evil of man? The ultimate meaninglessness of existence? Do we really need this much blood to do so?Sigh. Okay. How about this? The Coens have attempted to adapt what I suppose is a serious American novel to the screen. However, if that is the case, I shouldn't have to accept the usual suspension of disbelief. Thus, how is it that this ultimate killing machine was apprehended by the not-so-bright deputy in the first place? We first see Anton in custody - - handcuffed as it were. From then on, this psycho has essentially killed everyone he has chatted with. That was a major loose end for me.Another friend considered the film a rip-off of The Terminator, which he says in turn was a stolen idea. Even down to the scene where Anton has to repair himself.Other critics have called the film ""funnier than Fargo"", which if true, is pretty distressing. In the theater I was in, there were indeed chuckles in the appropriate spots, but when I saw Fargo, people were laughing loud and hard throughout. To imagine a theater audience doing so with this film is downright chilling.","

"ken-lynne","16 March 2008","How this film even got nominated for an Oscar is beyond me and the fact that is won as best picture totally blows my mind. I thought it was pretty good, with some really different ways for a hit-man to kill folks. But, the ending was so horrible it ruined the entire movie. I think the writers just flat ran out of material and decided to run credits. You are left not knowing how one major was killed; not knowing for sure if an actress was, in fact, killed and not knowing what happened to either the stash or the money. Tommy Lee Jones has always been one of my favorite actors but, in this piece of trash, I don't think he was on screen for much over 15 minutes total and his part basically had nothing at all to do with the so-called story. All I can say is - YUCK!!!!","

"qormi","18 July 2008","This film was pure genius. The Coen brothers are very talented. Like Fargo, this film was riveting and full of surprises. Unlike Frago, it had little, if any, humor. The cinematography was breathtaking, with scenes of the desert and big sky captivating. The protagonist, Chigurh, was relentless and you kept hoping he'd get his just desserts in a big way. This was a three-way chase film,, and had its shocking moments. Josh Brolin was excellent as the cowboy type and he carried the film in a big way. I don't know if he was nominated for an Oscar, but he should have been. Tommy Lee Jones's character seemed to epitomize the title of the film. An unforgettable classic. Chigurgh has a haunting presence. A scary, brutal, tense drama that reaches out and grabs you. There are times in a film when you wish you could intervene and step into the screen. That means you're captivated. This is one of those films. It grabs yo emotionally. What a ride.","

The Coens directed this film with such mastery, precision and restraint. I don't think I've ever seen a better example of less is more in a film. It would be a sin not to mention the cinematography. Roger Deakins once again knocks it out of the park with his beautiful frames. He is without a doubt my favorite cinematographer. The acting is superb. Javier Bardem was absolutely terrifying as Anton Chigurh, truly one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones both give the greatest performances of their careers. This film is a masterclass in tension. This is best complemented by the use of silence. There is no music in this film. (Apart from the end credits of course) Which makes for some of the most anxiety-inducing scenes I have ever witnessed. But at it's core, the film is about the inevitably of death and the passing of time. I will not spoil it but this film contains one of the most beautifully ambiguous endings ever, it fully contributes to its themes. No Country For Old Men is another one of my indisputable all time favorites.","

"photoe","5 May 2008","Let me start with the good. The movie is beautifully shot, creates an authentic feel for Texas, is well acted, offers good suspense, and has a truly scary villain. What starts out good goes severely downhill to a really unsatisfying ending, however.I was shocked but fine with Brolin being taken out (from an unexpected direction), and it lent realism. I also understand Tommy Lee Jones wanting to give up. However, to let the villain off the hook after he does the huge dirt he does, was a total crock. It wasn't just Tommy Lee Jones who would be after this villain. He kills a deputy at the very start of the movie. Texas law enforcement does not look too kindly on that sort of behavior. I'm also getting tired of the constant justification of murder in movies by a 'murderer's code'. We have enough lack of justice in real life. What people pay to see is the bad guy eating his sanctimonious trumped-up morality at the end. So the direction this movie took was bad morality, bad logic and bad entertainment all wrapped into one. These movies feed a curiosity for violence, and of course I watched the movie knowing what I was in for. To build up hatred for a villain, and doubt in the hero, Tommy Lee Jones, and then show the hero to be weak, and the villain to go scot free is pointless. Is the final car crash supposed to be god playing with him? Why isn't he killed? Why don't two kids carjack him and kill him on the spot? That would have fed into the title, the villain being done by someone even younger than him. As I said, we know real life already, and even in real life, killers like this guy don't go scot free. This villain killed 20 people over a week, and no one is capable of catching up to his randomness? Perhaps things are that bad in TX, but I doubt it. Pretty stretchy on the believability.They also don't show a couple of key murders, including one that's fairly critical at the end, and adds to the chaotic finish. Harrelson's disposable character makes zero sense. He's sent after the villain because he's a supposed pro, and then just gets caught and offed so easily? Harrelson had to be given something to showcase his toughness, and there was nothing. The villain then goes into his employers office and kills him for sending Harrelson. Talk about clichéd.The philosophical conversations about murder and death and honor were done FAR better in Apocalypse Now. I cant believe this movie received ANY Oscars, except maybe for cinematography. Ultimately a pretentious film with a disturbing subtext about powerlessness that is addressed but not fully developed.Yes, I grasp films that break the mold in which the villain gets away, but in this film it is a pretentious choice. Brolin's character was doing a great job of fending off the villain and his childish arrogance, but then Brolin got caught from a different direction. Doesn't serve the previous character development, but OK, The villain then goes after Brolin's wife later because of his psycho 'code', with what happens not shown, but implied. This was a moment for Tommy Lee Jones (or anyone) to show up and finish him, including her. I know this would have been a predictable ending, but the film was more or less a typical mob money chase movie, not a particularly original premise.The Cohn brothers are renowned for a style, and it's turning into a set of gimmicky choices about breaking clichés in ways that are more annoying than effective and original. When you make a movie far less entertaining by deconstructing a cliché in a way already done, you aren't being original, you are being a pretentious bad director. I understand Tommy Lee Jones abdication at the end, but what is the point of all the conversations about how his granddad had it tough as well, or that evil is eternal? He just decides to sit it out? He doesn't even speak on the topic in a manner that you can tell he's deciding to sit it out. VERY sloppy, indifferent, inadequate rendering of the material in my eyes.Overrated for making a violent aggressive movie with a confused whimper of an ending, and calling it the 'real world' doesn't cut it. Even if this is the way the book was written, the finale, or lack thereof, was directed in a way that was chaotic, indifferent to the audience, and therefore pretentious.","

He gives in to temptation, and takes the cash, vaguely aware there may be some payback for it. He finds himself being pursued by the psychotic Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who leaves a trail of blood and destruction behind him. On both their trails is Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and his deputy. On the verge of retirement, Bell really is starting to lose his faith with people and the world.Although they're regarded as gold by film lovers in general, I can only remember one film of the Coens I thought was great, and that was the snow drenched Fargo. I'm sure there are many others, I've just not bothered to see them, but I have just seen this new one that makes me further of the persuasion that maybe I should see some more of their older ones. The brothers have crafted a film based around atmosphere, mood and tension, where such little things as a sweet wrapper unfolding, a tracking device beeping or a telephone ringing are given new dimensions. Some, less refined, viewers might find the film 'boring' but quite simply they don't know enough about film or what makes it an art form.Getting the style and substance of the film so right, the Coens are also treated to some brilliant performances. Bardem (could have fooled me, I thought he was Robert Downey Jr.???) is the star of the show, as a genuinely scary and unpleasant guy, who takes no nonsense, leaves bloodbaths not bodies and even has to creep people out when he's apparently just joking with them. Jones also shines as the world weary cop, who really does feel like he's about to lose his faith in human will and nature. Rising star Brolin is sadly left to basque in their greatness, alongside supporting stars Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald.Not one for those with the attention span of a knat, then, but for those who truly appreciate films and what makes them an art form, this is highly recommended. *****","

"rimsey-2","30 December 2007","I saw the trailer for this film while i was at the movies with a group of friends recently and the violence in that deterred everyone else in the group from going to see it. However i've always been a bit of a Coen brothers fan and i'd read the great reviews this movie has garnered and i was determined to overcome my general squeamishness in the face of unrelenting violence so i went to see it on my own. As it turned out the cinema was full of people most of whom i guess had read the same reviews as me. Or perhaps they'd decided to escape the unrelenting Adelaide heat by spending a few hours in the tranquility of an air-conditioned cinema. I have to say at the end that I think there was a general air of disappointment from everyone in the movie theatre. I'm still trying to figure out exactly what Tommy Lee Jones role IS in this movie. He could have been left out altogether and it would make no difference at all to the film. The ending where he describes his dream sequence is a terrible letdown. How many people enjoy listening to someone describe their dreams?Its about as interesting cinematically as it is in real life. When he finished I think everyone was hoping that this wasn't going to be the end of the movie...and then the credits began to roll. The movie does contain some wonderful quirky dialogue and some great acting from Javier Bardem. There are suspenseful moments while Josh Brolin in on the run and this is no formula driven plot where you can tell what is going to happen from one moment to the next. What it lacks is a coherent narrative and a sense of conclusion. Or is there a ""No country for old men 2"" in the offing?","

Then I wondered why it took so long for NCFOM to make it to my local theater and I thought, hey, it could be like CRASH--that movie had never played locally and I was surprised to find that it was released on DVD just before the academy awards were shown, so quite possibly, NCFOM could have just slipped through the cracks--just like CRASH. I was wrong. This movie should have been burned in a raging fire. What a waste of time this turned out to be. There was no compelling background about the protagonist or the antagonist.A lot of hype over one of the worst movies ever nominated for an award. I kept waiting for the story to unfold and to achieve a raging climax, then all of a sudden it was over and there was no money shot, no ending, no nothing--just some trivial blubbering dialog that had nothing to do with the story I thought I was watching.It turned out that the characters that were at odds with each other through the whole movie were not the characters who the story was about.This was definitely the worst movie that I watched to the end without yawning or falling asleep.

"volhome","22 March 2008","When the trailers for Old Country came along, I must say I was mesmerized. The introduction of a wanton killer that seemingly strode his own path in a place and time yet to be determined. Along for the ride, the critics' glowing praise of the movie and especially the glow from Oscar winning performance of Javier Bardem sold me. I had missed the movie in the theatre, but seeing it on the big screen at home would make up for it. The anticipation began high, as the storyline was laid out. Heck, Josh Brolin was doing an excellent job with his little mentioned role. Tommy Lee Jones was giving another workmanlike laid-back performance as well. An there was, of course, Javier, plodding along. Okay, stick with this, it will grow and develop. Hour number two starts, and the foundation is well laid. Javier is playing a less than remorseful toad. Everyone else is playing their roles in a deadpan manner. Lord, is this what the people in Texas are really like? Don't worry, though. The critics have assured that Javier's performance is well worth it. Then the second hour ends. And so does the movie. Wait, is that the credits? You're kidding. Right? I just watch two hours of everyone playing like they were under Karloff's make-up from Frankenstein? Folks, Boris made that character believable and sympathetic. This drivel made me hate everyone associated with the movie. We didn't get a decent bad guy. We didn't get a story with a morality play. We didn't get decent ending or hope for the future. We got a stinking pile of manure and Oscar noted efforts. Well if this is what the Academy Awards have come to, then I'll make sure I never see another Award winning movie again. They passed on Kevin Costner as Mr. Brooks for this? Of, for God's sake, Please, someone tell me where I go to get a refund for the two hours of my life spent on this. I'm there in a heartbeat.","

"cherold","20 September 2008","I love the Coen Brothers for their quirky comedies like Raising Arizona and Hudsucker Proxy, but I'm always underwhelmed by their pulp dramas, like Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing and, most recently, No Country for Old Men.I could tell early on I wasn't going to like this, but got sucked in by a brilliant, menacing performance by Javier Bardem. Like John Turturo in Miller's crossing, Bardem is an electrifying presence in a sea of blandness. Bardem's scenes are gripping and mesmerizing, but that leaves the 60% to 70% without him quite dull.Structurally the movie is interesting. The movie relies on the audiences' familiarity with film structure to raise certain expectations and then thwart those expectations one by one. It's an interesting idea, but while arguably what happens is more likely than what usually happens in movies, it's also less interesting and less clever. And since the movie as a whole still isn't realistic (and is also decidedly mannered), there doesn't seem to be much point in throwing in some realistic events to try and add some irony.As mentioned above though, I never like Coen Brothers pulp dramas, so if you like the others, you ought to like this one too.","

"THE-BEACON-OF-MOVIES-RAFA","8 February 2020","A Gruelling, unapologetically raw and, for better or worse, draining crime thriller. No country for old men benefits greatly from its immersive cinematography, Cohen-esque script, and a scene-stealingly visceral performance from Javier Bardem --- making for a well paced narrative, that twists and turns its way to a conclusion that will satisfy you in the most bittersweet way. Iroh's grade: B","

"NightOwl0","11 October 2007","I was privileged to see this gem at the New York Film Festival and I am still reeling from the experience. The first word that comes to mind when thinking about this film is haunting. This film is absolutely haunting and you will think about it a lot after seeing it. There are long arias of silence in this movie that are thrilling to experience. You do not notice the lack of dialog in this picture because the images the Coen Brothers create are so entrancing. This is a film of quiet and meditative power. The Coen Brothers confidence in their visual finesse is completely in evidence from the first frame to the last. The last time I saw a crime picture this good I was watching the Coen Brothers masterpiece Blood Simple. This time they have created a sort of tone poem of the American southwest. This film is drenched in blood and chaos but it is filmed so artfully that the work eventually trumps the crime genre itself. This movie is all the more amazing in that the Coen Brothers manage to combine the archetypal and the firm establishment of an everyday reality so successfully. The characters have a specificity to them, but are also able to be embody larger themes.This will not be a film for everyone. This will be a film for people who appreciate the work of Terrence Malick. If you have seen the terrific true crime drama The Onion Field you will have some idea of the power of this film. This is a film that Truman Capote would have appreciated. The plainness and starkness of the sudden violence in this movie reminded me of the bracing wind-blown prose of Capote's masterpiece In Cold Blood. This is not just hyperbole, this film is that good. I have never seen such a melancholy movie that was so alive with the wonder of cinema. There are cat and mouse sequences in this film that would have made Hitchcock or even DePalma, for that matter, weep. The cinematography is breath-taking without being showy. Every shot is perfectly framed and the editing evokes a slow creeping dread. There is almost no music in the piece which is a great choice and really forces you to pay attention to the dark proceedings at hand.Javier Bardem gives an amazing performance. His performance is all the more impressive when you know that he has admitted to struggling with his command of the English language. His character has several monologues that are well-timed and full of implicit menace. He gives a terrifying portrayal of a complete psychopath who seems to live in a shadow world of duplicity and violence. This character kills most everyone he comes into contact with sometimes prolonging the moment of sadism by flipping a coin and asking his potential victims to call it. His odd prince valiant hair-cut is a great touch and makes him seem even weirder. Bardem has a fantastic scene in which he taunts Woody Harrelson with the grisly fate he has in store for him. He is so intense in the scene he seems to almost up Woody's game a bit. Tommy Lee Jones gives his usual solid performance. His character is a sort of bewildered older cop who cannot really comprehend the violence he has to contend with anymore. It is strange to see Jones play a character who is wise, but whose wisdom was so hard won that it has worn him down to the nub. He has some good lines, but the overall comportment of the character is one of sad confusion. His morality is so offended by his reality that he retreats into the honorable refuge of retirement. Although, in the last scene we get the feeling that he will be haunted the rest of his days by the horrors his eyes have witnessed again and again. Jones seems to be giving his usual clever/sly performance which subverts your expectations when he becomes sad and meek toward the second half of the film. Josh Brolin is becoming a more interesting actor with age. It is hard to believe that he is the same kid from The Goonies. His character Moss is not a coward or a complete fool. He has a soldier's tactical cunning and is able to think his way out of dangerous situations. However, he makes many bad decisions as well. This will be a frustrating character for the general audience because they will want him to become a hero when instead he proves himself to be all too fallible and human. I have not been very pleased with the commercial direction that the Coen Brothers had been going in of late. I am overjoyed that they have again found some great material with which they could craft this true work of art. To be fair they had a great book by Cormac McCarthy to work with, but they still found a way to make it their own. This movie makes Fargo look very light-hearted by comparison. It will not be a film that everyone can immediately embrace. I do think it will be a film that people will appreciate the more they think about it. The surface of the film is deceptively simple. This is much more than a clever genre film, like the Usual Suspects. There is no Tarantinoesque snarky irony to leaven the brutish and horrible realities of the violence for profit perpetrated in this fictional criminal underground. The maelstrom of violence depicted in the film is larger than the work itself. The film activates the issue, but does not seek to contain it. The enigmatic and open-ended narrative provides no reassurances that everything will be all right.","

"gigan-92","23 January 2012","A+ The Coen Brothers have definitely caught my eye. I know they have an impressive career, but this film is my favorite of theirs. It has the cinematography and location of a great modern Western, the lighting of a film noir, and the great dialogue of a Coen Brother film. The difference though is that ""Fargo"" (another Coen brother favorite of mine) is a dark comedy-drama, and this film, as the Coen Brothers put it, is about the unstoppable evil"". Playing that evil is Javier Bardem as Anton Chigur, and he's one of the best movie villains I've ever seen. The theme of the movie, as in the book it is based on, is the decadence of our country. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are subject to this. Those expecting a traditional morality tale, the triumph of good over evil, will not find it here.I find that the majority of the viewers say that they love the build-up of the movie, the pacing being perfect, the action great, and the drama well-written. What they often say they can't stand is the ending. Without spoiling the climax, I can understand where they're coming from, but I have to disagree. Anybody who watched ""Fargo"" for the first time surely didn't expect the brand of comedy the film dwelled on. In the same light, viewers of ""No Country for Old Men' should expect the usual guidelines to go right out the window. As a true film lover, the ending, no matter how against your wishes it maybe, try to keep this in mind: the filmmakers are attempting something different, something bold. I learned this lesson the hard way some time ago when I first viewed ""Arlington Road"".Also, kudos to Kelly Macdonald, who did an extremely well done job, and I love Woody Harrelson no matter the film. And despite all the film's seriousness, it does have a touch of comedy with the MacDonald character's mother, played well by Beth Grant.","

"classiccateringco","30 November 2007","First the good news, I did actually have to use a bit of brainpower while watching this, paying attention to each line and connecting the dots along the way. This was refreshingly non-Hollywood.The actors did a decent job of making the cartoon characters into real people with lots of good line delivery, subtle expressions and feeling of realness. The style of the film was also a nice change from the norm, I liked the silences.Now the bad news, it was still predictable (I knew that the movie would end after Tommy Lee Jones last monologue- don't ask me how, I just knew it).About halfway through the film I realized that evil would win out since it played like a Steven Seagal movie in reverse (with an infallible anti-hero). Not impressive in the least.Who was Woody Harrelson supposed to be? The Greek Chorus? His character was a waste of time.Cliché after cliché characters (writers fault). Drug dealing Mexicans, bumbling deputies, smart sheriffs, clueless wives, nasty mother-in-laws. Yawn, when have I not seen all this before.Did I just flat out disagree with the concepts behind it. Sure I did, cause I'm not addicted to TV news the way some folks are. In my experience the law enforcement actually works together and a person like the anti-hero would be called a mass murderer and hunted down. Suspension of disbelief only goes so far. It all points to bad writing. I'm sorry that someone was grappling so hard with the whole good vs. evil issue that they took the time to make something that is really a horror film into something it isn't.Is it art? No way. Does it contribute anything lasting to society or it's genre? Not really, perhaps some technical movie-making stuff but generally no.Don't waste your time on this one.","

"wdwallis","29 January 2008","There are just too many ideas that were not properly explained or developed, and occurrences that don't make sense. My feeling is that the Coens and other writers/directors/producers/assistants just didn't care.Spoilers occur hereafter.Why was Chigurh arrested at the beginning?The mechanics of the drug deal are not explained. Are we to assume one side decided to rip off the other or was a third party involved? In the former case, why does there seem to be evidence that the shooters came back (further damage to the pickup)? If the latter, why didn't they take the money?Why ON EARTH did Moss go back with the water bottle? It was totally out of character. If he had not done so, the whole story would have been different. (The existence of the transmitter would still allow it to work, provided Moss was really stupid, and there's a lot of evidence for that.) From this point on, I had totally lost my belief in the movie. It seemed likely that other occurrences would also be dictated by plot needs, not by common sense.How did Chigurh and co find out about the botched deal? The obvious answer is that they were in the pay of the unnamed crooked businessman and that the whole deal was a setup from beginning to end. But in that case we are back to a scenario where they would have been on hand to take the money before Moss showed up (whether the shootout involved a third party or not).Okay, the transmitter. What kind of moron would keep the money in the bag it came in? Surely you would realize that people would be looking for it, and a different-looking piece of luggage would be a good idea. And you would find the transmitter when you unpacked the money.So where was Moss going? Why did he run off? Why this hopping in and out of motels? And why leave his wife looking like a target? He and his wife should have left the country. And not to Mexico.It wasn't that easy to get back and forth across the border to Mexico, even in 1980. (Of course, if it wasn't so easy, the plot wouldn't have worked.)Coin tossing: this might have made sense if there were ANY other evidence that Chigurh's character had principles (no matter how insane), other than Wells' (Harrelson's character) one-liner. (And what was that character doing in the movie anyway? Pointless unless you give him more time.)This is about 10% of the flaws.All in all, a shoddy piece of film-making so that we can see lots of gore. Coupled with excellent directing and cinematography, so that the gullible will not notice the lack of substance.","

"joncha","23 August 2020","James Bond meets Texas Rednecks. There's this maniacal killer with a funny hair style and grim expression walking around with a gun and a tank of compressed air and either no one sees him or doesn't think to report his presence to the police. It never ceases to amaze me how quickly the local police in the Austin area where I live can come up with a suspect or make an arrest soon after a murder when there was no indication at first of who might have committed it. Yet in this movie the police are dumb or overcome with ennui or malaise that they can't capture or even track down someone who is so obviously on the loose and deadly. Especially after he killed the deputy early in the movie you'd think every cop in Texas would be on the lookout for him. So you just keep watching, wondering how dumber the people can be. And the kids: ""Hey, mister. Do you know you have a bone sticking out of your arm?"" I realize this story took place years ago before cell phones, but you'd think the kids would have thought to get someone to call for an ambulance.","

"mjhalta","29 February 2008","Once again Hollywood picks a movie as best picture that should be great but falls far short of the mark. Last years departed is another example. This movie is so full of holes it makes Bonnie and Clyde's car look like it just drove of the assembly line. The acting was so so but not great as is required to win an academy award. This movie reminded me of those slasher films where the killer shows up everywhere and kills everyone and leaves bodies everywhere and the cops are absolutely ineffective and useless. The one scene where the killer is fixing his own gun shot wound reminded me of other movies such as Terminator and Rambo, it's all been done before and better. To sum up, if you like violent action shows it's pretty good, if your looking for a movie that is Best Picture material this is not it.","

"harry_tk_yung","23 February 2008","Having watched the two Oscar heavyweights ""No country for old men"" and ""There will be blood"" within one week, I can't help noticing the sharp contrast in audio style: while ""Blood"" came with background music so overwhelming that it threatens to take over foreground, ""Old men"" had only silence, natural sound and dialogue, with no music at all. There is no right or wrong: each style serves its particular purpose. Imagine the scene in ""Old men"" with Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) in the middle of the night in a sunken hollow strewn with a few abandoned vehicles and dead bodies. As the menacing headlight of an ominous looking vehicle at the top of a slope threatens to approach, any kind of music would do more harm than good to the blood-chilling atmosphere.Let me back up a little. In their inimitable fashion, the Coen Brothers crafted this adopted story through a mesmerizing plot line that is ever elusive, giving you the slip every time you feel that you have got the hang of things. The plot line looks simple: a common young man who stumbles across two million dollars becomes the prey of a serial killer who is after the money (and his life), while a season sheriff comes after both  an almost standard cat-and-mouse story. But there are more than initially meets the eye.But first, the three main characters. Moss is not your ordinary reckless young man next door. Seasoned Vietnam veteran, he shows his stuff when chased by a ferocious killing bloodhound, hurriedly loading his pistol but never losing control, and firing it when the canine's deadly teeth is within three feet of his throat. He is undoubtedly the prey, but not one that rolls over and play dead. But this is really the hunter's show. Javier Bardem (""The sea inside"") who has won every Best Supporting Actor in sight is good enough to give Daniel Day-Lewis a run for his money had he been put in the contest for Best Actor, to which he has every right. The most amazing thing is that while his physical appearance is at times even comical (mainly due to the ridiculous hair style), his mere presence is so chilling that it makes Jason Voorhees, Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecter look like fairy godmothers in Disney tales. I'll come to Tommy Lee Jones later.As the movie follows the standard cat-and-mouse crime thriller development, the audience may be so hung to the edge of their seats that they forget temporarily that this is Coen Brothers. The climatic showdown that they tricked you into expecting never comes. Everything seems to fall apart in the last third of the movie. Not only that it is such an anticlimax, but you are not even allowed to see what actually happens. And that one last climax (which is standard for thrillers) is also a flop, and also one with an ambiguous, open ending. ""What the hell is going on"", you can hear some in the audience groan.But while the audience is still hot on the trail with agitated expectation of a Hollywood style showdown, the Coen Brothers have all but concluded this plot line and moved off to an even more important theme, the development of sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), whose involvement in this crime case is merely incidental. The cat-and-mouse game ended almost as an afterthought, with none of the excitement the audience thought they have been promised. The focus has long since shifted to depiction of Bell as one of the ""old men"" in the title. If you think back, most of the small roles (starting with the attendant of the now famous ""gas station scene"" at the beginning of the movie) are old men. While the audience might have forgotten, the directors/screen writers have not, that this movie is trying to show why this desolate Taxes country is ""no country for old men"". Added to this is the final touch (the accident) showing how bazaar life and reality can be.For those who still complain that they are not told/shown properly how Moss was hunted down, remember the pool side scene when a woman who is trying to seduce Moss. He tells her that he is married and is now out here keeping half an eye on his wife who is coming to join him and another half on something else so that he will not be caught unprepared, (something to that effect). The woman replies that this may not always be possible. There you have it, as clear as daylight, the directors' account of Moss's end, if you'd only pay attention.","

"tanelteder","18 January 2011","No Country For Old Men is one the best I have seen from Coen brothers. I liked their O Brother Where Art Thou but I disliked Fargo. Well, I gotta tell you, it's like a day and night with Fargo. The movie is an extremely creepy. A very haunting tale. There's something very gripping about this one. I think girls won't find it interesting that much. It's more like a guys territory. Boys enjoy it. Plenty of cool chase scenes and some awesome action ones which has a touch of Coen' power in it.The trio is fantastic. Javier Bardem, in his own words, is out of his comfort zone, but he delivers. A scary performance by him. Well, Tommy Lee Jones for that, is totally in his comfort zone. Josh Brolin with his mustache is good too.This movie is about men's country. Men rule and shape this country. How? See and maybe you get the answer.","

But this movie was pointless. And yes, I understand part of the appeal is there is no point, but so what. That doesn't entertain me at all.They had to include the Bell character to have any character have any development.I like movies that are entertaining on face value, and have a subtext and/or character arc that allow you to think and see some value and depth to the movie. This movie was entertaining at face value until the end. When it was over I was thinking back trying to figure out some hidden meanings, or something I have missed, and it wasn't there. Or at least make it so it doesn't break the suspension of disbelief and leave me sitting thinking what the hell? Javier Bardem was good. The only Oscar that was deserved. It makes me realize how much the academy is about politics and not inspired movie making.","

"cshep","13 February 2008","The Coen Bros. who have a fine body of work, do a Good job of presenting Good vs. Evil, in "" No Country For Old Men."" The main message of the film seems to be that Good and Evil have no purely defined path or motivation, and they have more common interests than differences, interesting, but NO, that is simply not true. Based on a novel by Cormac MeCarthy, the story centers around a drug deal gone bad in the Texas desert, and stumbled upon by Llewlyn Moss(Josh Brolin). He tracks down the theoretical last man standing,(the one who carries the money away), that person is found dead, with $2 Million dollars. Not one to turn down his new found wealth, he takes the buckaroos and goes back to the trailer court where he lives with his wife.Feeling guilt by not assisting one of the dying drug dealers, he returns in the dark of the evening to give him water, only to find himself being hunted down by more henchmen. He escapes, but the money men hire a psychopath,Anton Chigurh(Javier Bardem), to recover the $2 Million , in his own way. Of course he kills people at random, anyone who he chooses to ,sometimes by the flip of a coin, as if he has no will of his own. He is just a regular killing machine, and he has a unique(plot device) way of doing it. So , you have two story lines going, and then enter a third story line,Carson Wells(Woody Harrelson), a bounty hunter sent by the money men to stop Anton Chigurh. Needless to say, the hunter becomes the hunted. The film moves at a nice pace, the music score kept to a minimum, with regular sounds , ramping up the creepiness... The performances are solid by the top 3, Javier, Tommy Lee, and especially Josh Brolin, who has really developed into a top flight Actor!!!The major flaw of the film is similar , believe it or not to ""Smokey and the Bandit"", the two main protagonists, do not meet, and without conflict, there is no resolution. And finally, at the very end where Tommy Lee Jones is rambling on about his 2 dreams, the film cuts to the credits, hummmm, what is wrong with this ?, NO Resolution.. Yes, this does mirror life, but I like my films , like a good cup of coffee, you know that it will end with some satisfaction.... It is 90% a good film, but doesn't satisfy....Maybe the DVD will have 4 endings , like ""Apocalypse Now."", at least you would have a choice...There is also the premise in the film that ,most cops are not hip, and that they don't connect the dots, I found that somewhat insulting, because with all of the murder and mayhem, that scenario is very unlikely.... So, if you like a film with no resolution, or non-ending then you should see it, but don't expect fireworks, just a good, tense thriller with an undefined ending, like math,you can't divide by zero....","

"LawrenceofAsia","23 November 2022","A gripping violent chase story with some dark humor in it. A good guy (Sheriff by Tommy Lee Jones), a bad guy (Anton Chigurh by Javier Bardem), and a guy in between (Llewelyn Moss by Josh Brolin) chase one another after Moss takes the money from a botched drug trade crime scene.It is a simple story, but shot and made very stylishly. The characters and vast wild country environment (a character by itself) adds texture to the story. The film doesn't have a lot of dialogues, but rather establishes the characters from what they choose to do and how they choose to do it.One of the themes of the movie is how time and crime shifts in the west Texas. The movie is sandwiched by the sheriff's monologue at the beginning (how life was simpler and made sense in the old times; now he can't comprehend the senseless violence of contemporary crimes.) and his conversation with his uncle towards the end, about the illusion he feels and the disappointment of his inability to deal with this new kind of criminality. That is where the title comes from.Another theme is that you can't see (stop) what is coming. Anton Chigurh asks his potential victims to call a coin to decide whether to kill him/her or not. A woman by a motel pool flirts with Moss: That's who you keep looking out the window for? Moss replies: ""Just looking for what's coming."" The woman quips: ""Yeah, but no one ever sees that.""It is a movie that keeps you on the edge of the seat. But the ending is not very satisfying to me.","

"funkyfry","16 March 2008","The last time the Coen Brothers got serious attention from the Academy, it was for ""Fargo"", a mid-western rehash of their first feature ""Blood Simple."" Now they've gotten a lot of attention from various awards for doing another psycho-murder film in Texas, equally inferior to ""Blood Simple"" as well as many of their intervening films including ""Barton Fink"", ""The Big Lebowski"", and ""The Man Who Wasn't There."" It's not that it's a bad movie in and of itself, and it's better than the other recent Coen Brothers movies I've seen, but it seems strange that these guys only seem to get the correct amount of attention when they make a relatively meaningless crime movie as opposed to their satirical masterpieces.At any rate, I read a few reviews before seeing the movie (skipping past the plot summary because I didn't want it to be spoiled) and some of the reviewers said that the Coen Brothers had finally ""grown up"" in this movie. The reviewer for ""Newsweek"" (David Ansen?) commented on how the film had seemed to drop the Coens' reliance on humor even in their ""serious"" films. I didn't see this at all. The best parts of the movie for me were the typically off-beat and morbid humor scenes, like Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) drinking the killer's (Javier Bardem) milk and telling his clueless deputy that drinking milk isn't a sufficient description of a suspect to put out an APB on. I like the vernacular of the script, and I like Jones' and Josh Brolin's performances very much. But I didn't quite see what the fuss was all about Javier Bardem's performance, it was pretty simple work I thought compared to what Brolin had to do. He just had the juicier role, that's all.The story here is pretty gripping, but ultimately goes nowhere. Probably the thing that impressed the critics the most and made them say the Coens ""grew up"" (as if this movie compares on an intellectual level to their best films, which as far as I can tell on a first viewing it does not) was that the film had an ambiguous ending. But it's not ambiguous in an interesting way like ""Barton Fink"", it's just ambiguous as if they didn't know how else to end it. There's no real idea here to justify the violence. The violence is done in a very exaggerated way to make Bardem's character more impressive. It's not much more subtle than your average action movie if truth be told. I guess we're just supposed to walk away remembering the scene with Jones and the older man, we're supposed to think about how Jones feels like he's over-matched by the criminals but it's actually the same kind of thing that people had to deal with back in the old west days. That's hardly a good idea to pin a whole movie on.Another problem I had with the movie is a whole host of uninteresting characters. The Woody Harrelson character has nothing important to do and seems to be here just a a link between the killer and his corporate employers. He does a half-assed version of the same character M. Emmett Walsh played much better in ""Blood Simple."" Poor Kelly McDonald seems like a good actress but had absolutely nothing to work with until her final scene with Bardem. You can see the seams of the plotting of the story showing through. Some of the scenarios are just ridiculous. The bag of money is supposed to have this tracking device in it, one that makes a loud beeping noise when it's taken out of the bag and which is quite large but which for some reason Brolin never hears or thinks to look for until he's already been tracked down twice. If the movie wasn't so well made technically speaking, these things could just be dismissed as action movie conventions, but this film should be so much better.I can't rate the film as a bad film because the suspense is pretty gripping and the action scenes are well done. Josh Brolin's character is very well done. I really liked the early parts of the film, Deakins' photography of the animals on the plains, the suspense of Brolin encountering the scene of the drug battle. The movie starts going downhill immediately when he goes back to try to give the guy water, a boneheaded move that pushes the movie into ridiculous territory almost right away. It's not a bad thrill ride but I think people are reading things into it that aren't there.","

The story was fresh and different and I don't think my friends had the capacity to fully enjoy what was going on on-screen. I did.

Let me try to explain.The Coens begin the movie with a voice-over against a barren Texas landscape, much the way Blood Simple began. In fact, there are several similarities between the two films, like the auspicious lack of music. A reviewer whose name escapes me once said that all Coen Bro. films look great and sound better. I'll get to sound later but to talk about the look... Other than some CGI animals, which really shocked me in such an otherwise perfect film, each frame is filled with such interesting material that the tone is set perfectly so that as you view a scene, you know whether to wait on a laugh or brace for...A large part of what fills those frames is great performances. Perfectly cast is Tommy Lee Jones. He nails it, the crowd goes wild etc... That's expected though. Josh Brolin, on a very recent hot streak, has given us two tremendous performances this year and both would have been a Cannes if the superbly talented Tarantino was loyal to his material and friend and kept the masterpiece that was Grindhouse untouched. Brolin's performance in that film was spot on with the perfect amount of ham and cheese to set the tone for the whole movie. In this one, he shows he can do just as well playing strait and absorbing into character as he does at crowd-pleasing cheesballing it. Kelly Macdonald will have to do something else to prove to me she really isn't the Clara Jean character she portrayed even though I know she is a Scot. Woody Harrelson, who I think gets too much praise sometimes, is at his best here and actually manages not to get blown off the screen (well sorta) by Javier Bordem. Mr. Bordem's performance is a force, much like the character he portrays. His Chigurh is a representation of the lunacy of violence that exists in society. There is no negotiations with it, it has always been here and it will always be here. It/he leaves us in shock and terror and all we can do is... ??? The first thing that needs to be said about the sound is that if another film wins an award all year for sound or sound editing, investigations should be held and the judges' bank accounts monitored. The sound in this movie is so shockingly good. There is no music (save some comically placed source music)and the movie is all the better for it. People talk about the way the music in Jaws enhanced the tension of what was happening on screen. People should, from here on say that the lack of music and the placement of source sound in No Country for Old Men thrilled more.I am certainly rooting for No Country for Old Men to come away with the hardware from Cannes.","

"filipemanuelneto","20 February 2017","This film is about a man who discovers a lot of money next to a slaughter between drug dealers, deciding to immediately take it of knowing, however, that someone will try to recover it. Its a very strong film, violent and a little difficult to digest. The reason for the title is not immediately evident but it ends up being perceived with the progress of the narrative. Beginning in a very elegant way, this one develops in a intensely and densely, constructing suspense around the three central characters. The ending, however, seems a little too sudden after so much dramatic tension, and so we get a little dissatisfied and expecting something more that never comes. The central characters are assured by Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem. The three of them were excellent, each in their own way, but Bardem stood out as a villain, with a deep, somber interpretation but holding the entire film around him. I believe that with this film Bardem has proved himself to be a great talent and has a promising future if he knows how to run his career well. The leadership is assured by the Brethren Cohen, in a dense register and away from the sarcastic comedies to which they have accustomed us.","

"asc85","8 December 2007","It seems that every single Coen brothers movie is going to be well-received by critics...have they ever been rated poorly? Accordingly, I go to the movies, but I know I may not like it very much. I respect the Coens, and I admire that they try to make so many different kinds of films. This is a very well-crafted film, and at this point, I think Bardem deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. That being said, the film was excruciatingly slow at many points, and simply lacked any soul.I tend to like their movies with humor, such as Fargo and Raisin' Arizona, but even that doesn't guarantee a good film (I hated O'Brother and Ladykillers). Their more serious films are technically very well-done, but usually lack any soul.","

"bankofmarquis","10 February 2016","I never give a movie 10 out of 10 stars when I first see it.  The movie needs to GROW to 10 stars (more than likely from a 8 or 9 star movie) over time.  The Coen Brothers' NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN has grown into a 10 star movie for me.Based on the fantastic novel by Pulitzer Prize winning author Cormac McCarthy (The Road), NCFOM tells the story of  Texas border town Sheriff Ed Tom Bell in the early 1980's, a man of an ""earlier time"" who feels that it ""doesn't take much to govern good people"".  Into his world come some NOT so good - and increasingly violent - people which makes Sheriff Bell question whether he belongs in this new world.At first glance, this movie is a crime thriller/action caper with bad guys fighting bad guys over $2 million in drug money.  Caught in the middle of this is hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who stumbles across - and takes - the money and is hunted by both sides. Violence ensues - and the violence is delivered in increasingly horrific and in a ""manner of fact"" manner.  However, this movie is much, much more than the violence and action which is why this film has elevated in my mind in the 9 years since it was released.Joel and Ethan Cohen won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay for NCFOM - and they are well deserved.  This is a strongly written and directed film by 2 filmmakers with a firm vision that they successfully translate to the screen.On top of this, the Coens continue to shine as strong directors of Actors.  Starting with Javier Bardem in his Academy Award winning role as the sinister, scary and intense Anton Chigurh (complete with bad haircut), you can go right down the list to screen stars such as  Josh Brolin (probably his finest work) and Woody Harrelson and character actors Garret Dillahunt, Barry Corbin, Stephen Root and Tess Harper - each one hits  the right notes.  Even Kelly Macdonald,  in what could have been a thankless role as Brolin's wife, shines.But, for me, this film hinges on the success of Tommy Lee Jones portrayal of Sheriff Bell.  I don't think it is too overblown to state that this performance is the best of his career.  It is a shame he did not get more Academy love.  His Ed Tom Bell is solid, confident, weary, beaten down and bewildered all in the turn of a phrase.  It is a bravura performance, one that has grown stronger over the years - especially in his closing monologue.  You would expect a violent picture like this to end in a blazing shootout, a la Quentin Tarantino, but instead you get a reflective monologue by Jones where he concludes that it really is ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)","

"krajo","22 May 2008","Like so many others, I went to see this movie based on the good reviews and high score on IMDb. None of my friends have seen it, so I got no warning of what was in store.Everything here is my opinion, I bought it on the flea marker :) The movie starts out well, I was impressed with the style, camera work and the down to earth choices the characters made. This lasted as long as there were no dialogs though. From that point on I started to feel uneasy, things just didn't connect. I started to notice how unreal the whole setup was and how illogical the story worked. In the end I felt that there was no conclusion or ending at all, because I couldn't figure out why anything really happened or ended and what the motivation of the characters was.It wouldn't be so bad if I could find some underlying message, or at least the movie put me in some different mood when I started to watch it. But no, I could feel nothing for the characters, because there was no connection on any level. And if there was some underlying message, that was overshadowed by the massive violence and imagery.Maybe I could find something enjoyable/thought provoking about this movie on a second viewing, but I just cannot bring myself to watch it again.BTW, I would have given it 4/10 for the visual style, but I don't want to see this movie anywhere near the TOP 250, thus the 1/10.","

"Xarx117","20 May 2022","This is the Cohen brothers Masterpiece and its an underrated movie. The dialog is extremely good. The quotes are funny, scarry and deep in meaning. The movie is what i could say raw, by the sense that there is hardly any music or emotions but you can tell those emotions if you look close enough in the actors faces. This is probably one of the main reason why some people dont like it, but if i can say to those people a word, i would say stop watching and try to understand the bigger meaning. The way the scenes transit to each other is very special. They cut a scene leaving you to ask questions but they don't answer them. Its a good example that we don't need to know everything in a movie for it to be good. Everything in this movie has hardly never been done anywhere else before. The acting performance is also stunning. The ending powerfully portays how life is not fair and how we should not expect it to be. This is one of the best message transmited trough script in history of films. This is surely one of the best movie script ever written.","

And now having watched it again 14 years later, I wonder the same.Yes there are some good performances and yes it's a reasonable story. However, surely for a movie or any story really to really grab you, one has to care. One has to care about at least one of the characters and some of the associated outcomes.None of the characters have any redeeming features really. So this rather slow and ploddy film leaves you unsatisfied and wanting more. Maybe that's the point? Maybe it's meant to be a little more reflective of life itself. A little unsatisfactory?Either way, maybe I'll give it a try in another 14 years?","

"Minerva_Meybridge","17 March 2008","I watched this film knowing it was written by the Coen brothers. I have enjoyed their films in the past. I sat through this waiting for an ending, but none ever came. There is no hope in this story. There is no message. Parts of it were just plain wrong. The film was laconic and in the end, I wondered what role Tommy Lee Jones's character had in it at all. Nothing he did had any effect on any of the events or the characters. What were they thinking? Have the Coen brothers just grown mean? What I am wondering more than anything is how on earth this won Best Screenplay? This is why I no longer watch the Academy Awards. It this is the best that Hollywood can muster, then the film industry is doomed.Where O Brother, Where Art Thou was clever, No Country for Old Men was cruel. There is nothing noteworthy about this film. The acting acting sustains a rather mundane piece of scripting. I'm sure there are die hard fans who will sing praises from on high, but I was ultimately disappointed in the end, because there was no end. But it did make me think...about how much I will want to watch the next film with the Coen brothers' name.","

I guess they just woke up and said, ""I don't feel like finishing this... just tell them we're done... our name alone is enough to sell this as a whole movie"". Well, some of us noticed. I would like to see this thing completed someday, as it started out good, had some decent acting, and the cinematography was bland and washed out like ""The Mist"" and ""Delores Claiborne"". What ever happened to Technicolor? Tommy Lee Jones must be Barnaby Jones' older brother that never used sunscreen, because he looks like he died of old age several decades before they invented enbalming fluid... it is no wonder that his character didn't actually do anything but show up after everything was over. The main ""bad guy"" really didn't have much to do except ""act"" unemotional. He was ""The Terminator"" only more robotic. The ending didn't suck; there was no ending. The Coens just quit.","

"aciessi","18 October 2017","The Coen Bros. have had their heyday long before the release of No Country for Old Men. Had they left the 90's burnt out, it would've been completely understandable. But 10 years ago, they crafted an ingenious comeback by making perhaps the most convincing, powerful film about pure evil in history. No Country for Old Men is one of the greatest films ever made.. but you already knew that. I'm sort of late to catching up to this one and I regret it entirely. Visually speaking, it captures the darkness of our world in ways no film has ever been capable of. In terms of acting, it absolutely soars. Broiln and Jones are incredible. Javier Bardem is terrifying as Anton. He eats at your soul. As far as films that depict serial killers, this is as real as it gets. Right down to his weapon of choice, an air-powered captive bolt gun. The savagery is what gets me the most.No Country for Old Men explains to us in no uncertain terms how malicious and conniving humanity can be. What's even better is the fact that movies like these aren't rare to come by. They've been made time and again. The Coens just decided to make one more. Bless them for it.","

"drystyx","22 June 2008","I've heard older men talk about the famous ""snifpe hunt"", where they take an unsuspecting naive person into the woods with a sack to wait for snipes, but none show up. Well, welcome to the snipe hunt. The entire cast, writers, director, all of them are laughing at everyone who watches this mesh. There is nothing poignant or deep here. It is just a mess. It began as a book, and to be honest, the book and movie are actually a ""spoiled brat remake"", or ""modernist Beavis and Butthead version"" of the classic NIGHTFALL. As near as one can make out, every major character has many guns. One finds all kinds of money, and magically everyone knows where everyone else is all the time. Now some of this is explained by a bugging device, but somehow everyone knows who everyone else is. Despite all the bloodshed, this still manages to plod on in complete boredom, which reminds one of the worst decade in film history, the seventies.All this because some hate filled bubble boy didn't like NIGHTFALL. So, we still have the lady's man who finds the money and is pursued by killers, one of whom is a maniac who pretends to make the assassinations a game of chance, and the other a saner man who resents him, and we have the addition of the ""investigator who is in over his head"". Jones takes the part once handled by Gregory. It's unfortunate that Jones is not an actor, but acting is looked down upon by the twerps of modernism.How does junk like this win awards? Because the people giving awards are even dumber than the people making movies like this, and that is hard to believe.","

"ackstasis","4 January 2008","There are very few filmmakers working today who can match up against Joel and Ethan Coen. Since their neo-noirish debut with 'Blood Simple. (1984),' the brother directors have dominated modern cinema with their unique brand of writing and storytelling, evoking the atmosphere of classic films while always maintaining a distinct sense of originality. 'No Country for Old Men (2007)' comes after a somewhat disappointing five-year stretch, during which they produced the second-tier remake, 'The Ladykillers (2003),' and the fun but inconsequential 'Intolerable Cruelty (2004).' Adapting the 2005 novel by Cormac McCarthy, the Coens have created one of the most harrowingly-intense cinema experiences you'll have all year, a cat-and-mouse game of drugs, violence, money and murder that will leave you gasping for air, and clawing at your armrest in search of some comfort. While this film is not the pair's most respectable outing  there's a certain roughness to the film that I couldn't quite connect with  they've certainly never delivered anything so chillingly gruesome and suspenseful.The year is 1980. When local hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) happens upon the site of a massacre in the middle of the parched, Texan desert, the apparent aftermath of drug deal gone wrong, his discovery of the $2 million payment, bunched neatly in a leather suitcase, prompts him to make a few decisions he'll come to regret later on. A psychopathic hit-man, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a grotesque killer with no scruples, arrives at the scene to recover the money, only to find the loot missing and the remains of Llewelyn's abandoned vehicle. While the two men play a deadly game of hide-and-seek across the Texan countryside  Anton killing fellow conspirators, law enforcers and innocent victims at every turn  soon-to-be-retired sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) reluctantly follows, disillusioned by the overwhelming amount of evil present in the current world. The exploits of these three main characters, though they rarely share the screen, seem to blend feverishly among one another, and the eventual outcome of the story is one that you're unlikely to see coming.Anton Chigurh is certainly one of the more formidable villains to come our way in recent years. Though lacking the complexity of somebody like Hannibal Lecter, Chigurh is most terrifying because he is the complete opposite: silent, methodical, ruthless His actions are almost mechanical in their simplicity and practicality; he will do whatever is needed to get the job done, with little thought for human life {it would not be unreasonable to liken Chigurh to the Terminator (1984)}. His opening scene is the cinematic equivalent of a violent kick in the gut, a sequence as shockingly violent as I've seen in the first five minutes of any movie in recent memory {though, admittedly, I do tend to stay away from any film that promises a lot of bloodshed}. After this, the Coens show no signs of letting up, and, time after time, we are treated to one graphic death after another. The presence of a few off-screen murders does show that the two filmmakers' awareness that a cut-away is often more appropriate, but I think perhaps their penchant for blood takes the film a bit too far. I'm generally all right with violence if it contributes to the story, but at what point does it simply become gratuitous?Sprinkled amongst all the tattered bodies in Anton Chigurh's wake is a Coen Brothers script that delivers the black humour and witty dialogue of most of their previous films. The screenplay cleverly interweaves the extreme violence of the story with an amusing combination of droll banter and uneasy conversation, most noticeable in the scene in which Chigurh challenges a nervous service station owner to a coin toss (""what's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?""). Though I chuckled quite regularly, I also feel the need to denounce the film-goer in the row ahead of me, who, rather distractingly, laughed at every single line as though it was the greatest thing since Charles Chaplin got himself caught on the conveyor belt. 'No Country for Old Men' is most stylistically similar to the Coens' debut effort, 'Blood Simple. (1984),' and, thematically, it deals with the same issues explored in both this and 'Fargo (1996);' namely, the corrupting power of money.The ending for the film, which was greeted by a hushed moment of universal confusion in the cinema, remains true to the source material. Though it was undoubtedly interesting to hear Sheriff Ed Tom Bell recounting his confused and insightful dreams, the tension in the final twenty minutes drops off so dramatically that ""anti-climax"" is the only word that comes to mind. The Sheriff's vision of his long-deceased father ""riding on past"" and ""fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold"" is an obvious allusion to death and the possible afterlife. As near as I can tell, and I have a history of missing the point on such thing, the dream seems to be summarising the film by declaring that there is evil in the world, there always has been evil in the world, and there always will be. Perhaps the only way you can escape this evil is in death, where the Sheriff's father is waiting for him by a roaring fire in the depths of the cold, dark night.","

"shermanlazzar","9 January 2008","I went into this film with high expectations. So, that being said I would still consider this a worthwhile film to go and see but I was left surprised at the critical acclaim the film had received. It wasn't that special.I have never been a huge follower of the Coen brothers work. I love Fargo but that's really it. Their films are usually a little abstract. This story follow a retired welder Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who whilst deer hunter in the Texas desert stumbles across half a dozen corpses in what seems a drug-deal gone wrong. He also comes across $2 million in cash in a brief case and decides to keep it. The rightful owners of the money (Mexicans) find out the identity of Llewellyn, whose truck was found at the scene and they send a ruthless hit-man Anton Chigarr (Javier Berdum) to recover the money. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is on a mission to try and protect Moss and in doing so, catch the elusive Chigarr.The performance of Bardum as the villain Chigarr, is what makes this film worthwhile watching. It is one of the most chilling characters on the big screen for years and any scene he was in makes you sit up and take notice.Sadly, the same cannot be said for other characters, particularly Tommy Lee Jones' role as the Sheriff who I found progressively more uninteresting throughout. **SPOILERS*** And this is my major criticism of the film (and I know I'm not alone here) because the Sheriff's character deliver a couple of monologues in the film that were crucial in conveying the themes in the film, particularly the last scene. But by the last scene monologue, I had tuned out because the Sheriff's character was so boring. Upon watching the film again, some obscure dream described in a monotone monologue is not the way to conclude a film or make a definitive point. The fact that many were looking around confused when the credits rolled is never a sign of concise film-making. Not having an ending shouldn't always be applauded. Sometimes it is lazy storytelling and I have to think that this was the case here. ***SPOILERS END***** To be honest, it is hard to see what themes in the film haven't been explored before. There is nothing groundbreaking here. If the film was a good old fashion, lone ranger versus a ruthless Drug-lord - fine. In the sense the film is more than satisfactory. But the film purports to be so much more. And the attempt by the film to get these points across to the viewer was disappointing and lacked imagination. Cinematography was great and some of the action scenes were terrific. But at the end of the day, I'd only class this film as worthwhile, nothing more.","

The performances are some of the best of their careers, Javier Bardem and Tommy Lee Jones in particular - the former being one of the best movie villains of all time.Even in these dark crime movies, there's usually some sort of climax in which things are resolved; not here, there are no happy endings, which sets it apart from most other works, both features as well as literature.Overall, a splendid and well-acted movie that's sure to leave you empty, yet satisfied!","

"fciocca","27 June 2021","""No Country for Old Men"" is one of those rare movies for which I do not have any remark. The buildup and the tension that the Cohen brothers managed to craft is amazing and the film keeps you constantly on the verge. You always wonder which is the next move of Chigurh, which is the strategy of Moss to avoid getting killed. All the events are so well connected and especially believable. Nothing feels forced or out of the place.Characters are amazing. Anton is cold and ingenious. He is extremely calm, while he performs his hits, a perfect psychopath, that really scared me for his behavior. Javier Bardem gave an excellent performance and this role just fit him like a glove. Tommy Lee Jones plays the sheriff of a small town, where basically nothing really bad happens, and despite his skills, he decides to avoid the main investigation because he does not want any kind of responsability or pressure. His acting is just on point, as he speaks with the accent of the county. The whole cast is composed by grade A actors such as Woody Herrelson or Josh Brolin. They have completely nailed it.After more than 10 years, this product is still one of the most beautiful crime stories: the script is extremely solid, I never felt bored or annoyed by some scenes or characters. This is how a film should be made, if you want to keep your audience invested. I definitely recommend watching it. Beware though: there are tons of violent and explicit scenes.","

"3xHCCH","1 February 2008","I watched this movie because it was the pick to win the Oscar for Best Picture this year. I don't get it. I did not like it. It was very long and episodic. While there well-shot individual scenes, yet with no coherence in its totality. It seemed to be about this guy Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who stumbled into a bag containing two million dollars, and how this money turns his life topsy-turvy (I know, we've seen that before). But somewhere down the line, it lost me as to what it was really all about.The violence is too brash and in-your-face, yet numbing and gratuitous. These scenes are largely due to one man, Anton, played by Javier Bardem, who really very creepy in his crazed killer role. He went to town with it, and is considered a lock for the Best Supporting Actor prize. While I was very distracted with his weird hairstyle, he was successful in developing tension in every scene he was in. He was especially effective in the quiet scenes like that with the gas station owner, the wife of Moss, and even that with a miscast Woody Harrelson. The question always comes up in your head--will he shoot them or not?The Texas accents are too thick for me to understand the dialogues clearly, and that further reduced my full understanding. That entire mumbling monologue of Tommy Lee Jones at the end was such a major anti-climactic let-down for me.I liked the Coen brothers' work with ""Fargo,"" that actually succeeds despite its unusual premise. But this one is very disorganized in its direction. This was exemplified was that strange decision was having a main character die off-camera. Why? It felt like you just wasted your time following his actions and decisions, just to have his character snuffed out so suddenly and anonymously.In general, I was very disappointed with this one. Maybe too much high expectations led to my reduced appreciation. Definitely, this was not how I felt after watching ""The Departed"" the other year. I knew right away that film was a winner. This one, I don't think I would even have the patience to watch again.","

I love a thinker, but this just took the biscuit. Here's my issues:
Let's follow Josh Brolin's character for an entire hour, only for him to be killed off screen with no real explanation. Just why?
The ending. I just don't understand it. There's no conclusion to the 2 hour story and you're left guessing.
Several of the characters served little to no purpose. If Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson weren't in it, the film wouldn't have changed in anyway, shape or form. Just pointless fillers.Overall it's just a film I expected so much from and it ultimately let me down.","

"videorama-759-859391","4 February 2015","This is a thoroughly entertaining movie you must put on your bucket list, with one of the most scariest performances from a great actor you'll ever see. The Coen Brothers have done it again with a great structured story. Although the plot is nothing new, it's the way this story is told, only enhanced by the great performance of Bardem as a psychotic contract killer, and I really mean psychotic. Escaping from police, he's after a suitcase of cash, in the wake of a drug buy that's gone wrong, out there in the country, that's left a score of guys dead. Unfortunately, but more unfortunate for Brolin, he's found the money and taken off with it, which again shows stolen moolah is blood moolah. This engrossing film from start to finish has it all, including some great comedy moments, one a trademark one, worth all it's amount in coin. There are some other great performances, notably, Tommy Lee Jones as a cynical and aging old sheriff. The scenes with him are gold, proving he's one of the greatest actors out there. Kelly Macdonald is really good as Brolin's nagging wife, who I must admit, I didn't realize at first. The ending is pretty grim, where seeing bones broken like in the Straw Dogs remake, makes me squirm a little. Too, for the viewer, nearing it's end, a ""Did he shoot her or not"" moment, which would of left a few movie goers ruminating, moments after seeing it. I believe the Coen brothers are incapable of making a bad movie, where to me, nothing they've done would score lower than an 8. This is one of those films, which I secretly refer to as movie candy. I could watch many times, and never be bored. Even the title is great, in a can't take your eyes off the screen movie. One criticism though was how Brolin was able to outrun that pick up truck of bad dudes, after he returned with that canteen of water, but hey all is forgiven. A must watch for everybody.","

"SoumikBanerjee1996","13 May 2022","It is a One-Man show! Despite the star-studded ensemble; this is a Javier Bardem show through and through. His disturbingly accurate portraiture of a sociopathic person along with the script's ingrained ability to make good use of the tension brings forth a certain uneasiness, an atmosphere fraught with unsettling sentiments; every time Mr. Bardem is featured in the center of the frame, somehow the entire execution got energized, rejuvenated.I think it is something to do with Javier's pragmatic characterization of the role that I find (and I'm sure a lot of the others do too) amusing and eerily realistic. The way he walked, had conversations, engaged in the acts of fury and rage; Ah! It was terrific. No wonder he bagged an Academy Award for his portrayal, needless to say, he thoroughly earned that glory.As far as the film is concerned, I found it to be a decent neo-western thriller, that's it, nothing more nothing less. There are mainly two reasons for that conclusion; one, I despised the ending as I firmly believe that there were much better ways to wrap up this narrative, and two, aside from Bardem's Anton Chigurh, there were no other characters that irked my curiosity.I know some of you might be infuriated about my views and might have the urge to question my taste in films, well, for your information, I'm not someone who's so much into western flicks, I do watch them occasionally, especially whenever hear something good has come up. So do not say I have a lack of understanding regarding this genre I just don't dig it as much as some of you might do. If this film has worked for you, fine, I'm glad it did. However, that doesn't mean it has to be the same for everybody else right? There will be exceptions to your 'Personal Preferences' and here I happen to be one of them.","

"davidmvining","16 February 2024","This is probably the purest genre exercise to win Best Picture since The Silence of the Lambs. It's all tension, quietly assembled and ready to break out into violence at any moment. This is a masterful adaptation of Cormac McCarthy by Joel and Ethan Coen, finding the little slices of black, deadpan, and offbeat comedy here and there, but mostly this is a dead stare of a threat against the audience's nerves. Told precisely both from a screenplay point of view as well as visually, No Country for Old Men is the stillest rollercoaster that gets the heart pumping.A drug deal goes wrong in the hinterlands of the Texas border county of Terrell County in 1980. Upon the aftermath comes Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a welder everyman who finds two million dollars in cash along with a dying cartel member. His humanity overcomes him, and he returns to the site to give the dying man water hours later, getting found out and starting a chase for the money. On his tail is the psychopath Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who uses an air pressure cannister and a heavily silenced shotgun to bring death to anyone in his path, but only by chance. He has this tic of deciding to let people go based on the results of a coin toss. A step or two behind the whole mess is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) who wants to help, wants to protect Llewelyn and his wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald), and simply does not understand the senseless violence breaking out around him.What is surprising about the film really is how still and quiet everything is. When Llewelyn comes across the aftermath of the bloodshed, the camera quietly pans as he walks through the results of the massacre, but the overall situation has this threat that we can't escape as audience members, and this is effectively how the film starts (it really starts with Chigurh murdering a sheriff's deputy coldly and violently, helping to create that sense of danger as well). There's very little overactive camera movement (when Llewelyn is running in the dark there's an accentuated camera shake that feels digitally enhanced), and it helps create this sense of unease in pretty much every scene. Whether we're looking at Llewelyn and Carla Jean sitting on the couch or Chigurh holding a shotgun to someone sitting opposite to him, the same, cool approach to visual storytelling is applied and it creates this sense of unease the violence could breakout at any moment.That's not to say that the film is uniformly tense. It's only mostly tense. The tension is broken up mainly by tiny parts with characters who show up for a scene or two, like the old lady who owns the small Del Rio hotel that Llewelyn holes up in with particular views on how many beds are appropriate for a man alone to have in his hotel room. These little interactions are peppered throughout, especially in the film's first half, and really do help alleviate the tension from time to time.However, the chase between Llewelyn and Chigurh simply will not stop until one of them is dead, and the grounded, quiet approach to the filmmaking around it makes every encounter in the latter half a matter of life or death as Chigurh kills those in his way, those who see him, and always getting closer to Llewelyn as he gets closer to the Mexican border and even crosses it. It's a cat and mouse game where Llewelyn gets a leg up only to lose it to Chigurh a little bit later, back and forth with moments around hiding the cash in a hotel or noting a shadow under a door. The stillness just gets to me as we're constantly waiting for violence to erupt.There's a late break in the tension with the introduction of Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), a fellow assassin sent by Chigurh's employer to clip his wings, having a couple of conversations here and there as he helps provide further context to Chigurh's propensity for violence. He's a breath in between larger set pieces, and the movie still doesn't relent.The film ends with violence, of course, but also providing Ed room to face his own mortality, having helped nothing along the way, and reflecting on how his father will be waiting for him in a mountain pass up ahead. There's a reflection on how violence has always been with us, perhaps on a bit of nostalgia for a time that never quite existed, and a concern that really, things might still be getting worse and what can one man do against that tide?So, it's a genre exercise that's almost painfully tense for very long stretches. It has moments of deeply black and offbeat comedy. It's got something on its mind that it conveys well. This is just great entertainment at the movies, and it's the kind of film the Academy wanted to award with Oscars through the 00s. This wasn't a terrible decade for that award, overall, it seems.","

"jon-c-ison","14 July 2020","A simple chase story with a modern Western vibe, brought alive by compelling characters brilliantly acted throughout. The core of the film to me was the simple portrayal of the humanity (good and ill) of the many characters, in sharp contrast to the interesting but chilling psychopath antagonist. Attention is paid to all the characters, even minor roles, and the subtle but very true portrayal of different facets of human nature - which is what really carries the movie. The action sequences are superbly done - chilling and blood soaked - and well timed, and the tension and pace is just right throughout. The ending, perhaps, is a bit sudden. Recommended.","

"jericha-27402","1 June 2019","There are no true heroes in this film and some of the characters fail to protect others. In my opinion, the villain was the only person who knew exactly what he wanted and how he was going to get it. He never backed down or hesitated, but the other characters did, which led to their downfalls.","

"Rockwell_Cronenberg","23 April 2011","At first, I saw this film as a straight story of violence and greed. However, it is so much more than just what's on the surface. The Coens take this interesting story of violence and turn it into one of the most shocking and intelligent studies of themes ranging from predestination versus the unpredictability of chance to American greed and consequences for violence.Llewelyn Moss is our main protagonist for the majority of the film, but it's Ed Tom Bell who serves as our opener and closer and his approach to the whole state of the world in this is a fantastic way of not letting the audience disappear into this world of violence. Instead of just accepting that this is the world of the film, we always have Ed Tom to come in and explain to us that this violent existence is our existence as well and it's disgusting. I've always loved the approach of a character who looks back on life with regret and this is one of the best examples of that. Tommy Lee Jones was the perfect choice for this role, and he really hits that stoic manliness while also just being filled with guilt and borderline disgust over the state of the world. Except it's gotten to a point where it's not even disgust anymore, it's just depressed indifference. It's brilliant.Our look at these characters ends with Ed Tom detailing one of his dreams to his wife. In the dream, him and his father were back in older times, traveling in this mountain pass. His father rides ahead with a fire and a blanket, not saying anything as he passes. The road is cold and dark and hard to get through, but Ed Tom knows that once he gets through it all and makes it to his father, he'll be warm and taken care of. Everything will be alright. Then comes the film's now-famous final line, ""And then I woke up..."", with him coming back into our world. It's kind of a chilling ending, again commenting on the rough and ruthless state of our current existence. Back in older times, no matter how hard things got, you would know that everything was going to be alright in the end. There would be a fire and light to keep you safe and warm. But now, that doesn't exist anymore. He woke up and now he's not so sure that everything is going to be alright when he gets through that rough terrain. There might just be more.I feel like the film is two almost separate entities. There's the chase down with Anton and Llewelyn and the drug money, then there's Ed Tom almost acting as his own audience, coming in and just being marveled by the immense violence that these men run through during the film. In so many ways, this is a film that doesn't follow any conventional means, and in keeping with this it's one of the few films where we not only see the consequences of violence, we see the aftermath. It's not like a serial killer movie where the detective gratuitously goes through the blood and carnage to find a clue. Ed Tom rides in and just...experiences the cost of the violence that these men don't think twice about when they present it into the world.One of the most interesting aspects of the film comes in the form of Anton Chigurh. Classified by most as a ""villain"", the character for the large part of the film represents so much more than that; anarchy, the cruel and unpredictable act of fate and, most importantly, consequence. A lot of people see Chigurh as just this unstoppable evil, but it should be noted that the character only acts out of a response to the violence of the world. He is only a part of this world because the world requires him to be. Someone like Chigurh coming into existence is nothing beyond the consequence for a world that has become so lost in it's belief that violence is the ultimate answer.Although in certain scenes, particularly the now infamous gas station exchange, he simply represents the uncertainty of fate. All of your life you make decisions that lead you down certain paths, and making one wrong decision could lead you to an immediate and unexpected demise. Chigurh at times can be the ultimate example of this, with the simple choice of heads or tails standing between you and a grave. The scene near the end with him and Llewelyn's wife, Carla Jean is a great representation of this whole thing. She tells him that he can choose to leave, that it's up him and he responds simply by saying that it's out of his control. Fate isn't in anyone's control and whether you like it or not, sometimes there are choices you make that lead you down completely different paths and this story just happens to have that choice potentially leading to the ultimate path.This is perhaps my favorite aspect of No Country for Old Men, the fact that the film isn't conventional in any way whatsoever. We have a ""villain"" with absolutely no backstory, there's no sign of hope or bright light at the end of the tunnel, the film doesn't end with a bang but with a whisper, major characters get killed off-screen, nothing is safe here and nothing is predictable. I think that the best films are the ones where you have no idea what's going to happen, but you know that whatever it is, it's going to be unique and incredible. You don't know what path you'll get taken down, but you trust the director(s) to take you down it.","

"Wochlainn","17 February 2008","I thought this film was awful.It is good if you like to watch films about interesting characters and screenplay. But I like my films to be entertaining, well acted, with twists and original plots. I didn't mind the ending, and didn't mind the slowness too much (even though it went on forever) but I have to say, my ass was numb, I dosed off 3 or 4 times, it was boring, the plot was simple but just done differently (but in a bad way).If you suffer from insomnia - watch this film and you will be cured. terrifyingly boring. the best part is the end just because I can finally get out of the cinema. The cinema was divided into idiots who laughed every time someone got shot or something stupid happened (they liked the film) and the other half clapped and laughed ironically when it ended and all I could here was people saying ""I wouldn't mind having the last 3 hours of my life back"" and ""that was f****** sh***!!!""","

"TxMike","12 April 2008","I figure that I really like about two-thirds of the Coen Brothers movies. 'Fargo' and 'The Man Who Wasn't There' are a couple of my favorites. They seem to do best in movies where good and evil, serious and funny, are juxtaposed. This one is very interesting, but has a sort of open-ended finish that may upset some viewers.The movie starts with a narration by Tommy Lee Jones who plays small county sheriff Ed Tom Bell, not too far away from retirement. As in 'The Valley of Elah', he is superb here. His part of this story begins when they find a bunch of bodies out in the scrub land, apparently a drug deal gone bad.Josh Brolin is Llewelyn Moss, a laborer type of man who happens upon the dead bodies while he is out hunting for Antelope with a high-powered rifle. He finds the bodies, and the drugs, and wonders where the money is. When he finds it, in the large briefcase, it is two $$Million in $100 bill packages. He isn't wealthy and decides his best course of action is to keep it. However, since the bad guys end up with his personal information when in a change of heart he goes back to give water to a dying man, and he almost gets killed himself, he decides that he and his wife need to leave their trailer and run.Javier Bardem is the very menacing man with no moral compass, Anton Chigurh. He is out to get the money back and doesn't have any qualms about killing anyone he encounters, even if they do nothing to him. He chases Llewelyn across Texas and into Mexico and back.Woody Harrelson is excellent in a small role as Carson Wells who also chases Chigurh. Kelly Macdonald, who was so good as a teenager in 'Trainspotting', is Llewelyn's simple wife, Carla Jean Moss.One of my all-time favorites, Barry Corbin of 'Northern Exposure' fame, plays Sheriff Bell's older brother Ellis. It was 10 years ago that I was an extra in a movie, and had the chance to sit with Corbin and have a pleasant conversation as we waited for the sound guy to get ready.MAJOR SPOILERS: Llewelyn's end comes at a cheap motel, and Chigurh ends up recovering a good portion of the money. As he is driving, he is distracted and gets into a severe crash at an intersection, but he manages to limp away. Sheriff Bell retires and muses over there not being a place for old men in our country.","

"Tweekums","24 June 2013","When hunter Llewelyn Moss comes across the site of a massacre in West Texas he does something that will make life very dangerous for himself and those around him; he picks up a case containing two million dollars. Soon sinister killer Anton Chigurh is looking for him and wherever Llewelyn goes Anton isn't far behind; leaving a trail of bodies as he goes. Also looking for the pair is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell; a law enforcement officer who understandable has difficulty comprehending the violence he encounters.This is a contender for the best film made by the Cohen Brothers; the tension is maintained throughout and there are quite a few surprises. These surprises aren't clichéd twists but things one doesn't expect in films of course listing these surprises would spoil the film for first time viewers. There is a bleak feeling to the film; both because of the casual extreme violence and the sun-baked Texas countryside. Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin are great as Sheriff Bell and Llewelyn Moss but it is Javier Bardem who is most memorable; his portrayal of the killer is frighteningly impressive; he isn't a musclebound heavy but still feels almost as unstoppable as Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator. It isn't just the three leads who are on top form; Scottish actress Kelly MacDonald loses her native accent and passes as Texan at least to my English ears. As the film reaches its conclusion the viewer will be left wanting to know what happens next for reasons that I won't spoil but left me quite surprised; so much so that I sat through the credits to see if there was a postscript there isn't.Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody who enjoyed previous films by the Cohens; just don't expect any laughs.","

"m_shankar20","18 February 2008","The film starts like a thriller. We meet Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who seems to be killing for fun. Then we meet Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who finds a bag full of dollars. And then, Anton is chasing Moss. The film moves like a thriller. But unfortunately, it does not end like one.There is no history or reason to Bardem's character. He is pure evil. He is invincible. On the contrary, Brolin's character is real and vulnerable. This difference in their characters lends a demon-vs-human kind of feel to the story. But the second half of the film disappoints. Chigurh's chase and Moss' accidental fortune both end in nothing. Then there is Tommy Lee Jones character which I found added nothing to the storyline, other than dollops of philosophical musings.Javier Bardem packs in a powerhouse performance. The cinematography is fantastic. Coen brothers do create an interesting character in Chigurh. But all that are achievements in isolation. I failed to understand what the story was about. It would have been an interesting thriller with a more simpler and straight forward climax.","

"saadanathan","29 June 2021","""No Country for Old Men"" is a brutal masterpiece. It depicts perfectly the horror and violence that America lives in. Usually the Coen Brothers' movies are dark comedies such as ""Fargo"" and ""The Big Lebowski"". This time, Ethan and Joel Coen have decided to make a full dark movie in terms of: genre, image and tone.The movie centers around Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who finds two million in cash after stumbling upon a drug deal gone wrong. What may seem as a happy ending turns out to be a cat and mouse game between Moss, the cartels and Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a hitman who is a psychopath. (no better way to describe him). The story follows Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), the sheriff of the town who investigates the case of Moss, Bell is supposed to represent the old generation of the country that had more morality, so it's because of the things he witnesses that he is retiring from his job, the world is too brutal for an old man like him, thus the title of the film.What most interested me was Chigurh's character, we as the audience see him only from the outside and know nothing about him, we know nothing about his background story nor how he became a hitman, his childhood or anything actually. He is definitely the type of character you want to explore more of. Overall this is a great movie, normally I wouldn't expect something brutal as this to come from the brothers but I'm mostly impressed.","

"abeach09","28 December 2007","At first, I thought this was a pretty good movie. I was entertained for most of it with good action scenes and was on the edge of my seat for a couple seats because of the suspense.However, once the movie ended I just gave a big ""WHAT?"" Did they seriously just end the movie like that? I do not understand how a writer could go through an entire movie about one plot of a guy chasing another guy...and then just end it with the cop who did nothing throughout the whole movie talking about his dream. Now I was trying to think about the symbolism behind the last scene and the only thing I could think of was that the dream signified that Tommy Lee Jones knew that the killer was coming for him next. He retired because he knew there was no use looking for the killer anymore because he was going to come after him. But in a movie like this, I don't think that is an effective ending. This wasn't some crappy multi-themed no plot movie. It had lots of action and a distinct chain of events plot and then it was ruined by the ending.Therefore, just wait til it comes to video because it is a solid movie but you are just disappointed by the ending.","

This is a Coen drama but if there is a Coen-drama formula, they have just redefined it, and indeed potentially rewritten how all thriller-dramas are written and directed. One of the most original movie structures and plots I have seen, up there with Memento in terms of innovativeness. Truly a modern masterpiece.","

"jtammyjas-1","2 December 2007","I kind of feel like I've been taken out on a date by some chick way out of my league who leads me on through the night then dumps me at the end for someone else. A part of me still wants to like her (this movie) because it showed such great potential. Both the main character, the Nam vet Moss, and the villain were impressive in their resourcefulness without being typical, over-the-top, Hollywood-style heroes and anti-heroes. I wasn't too impressed with either Woody Harrelson's or Tommy Lee Jone's characters, but they were secondary to the main contest. I was looking forward to the actual showdown though. Instead, Moss is killed by banditos, a scene which we are deprived of for some reason. The villain later kills Moss's wife and then, after an unrelated car crash, stumbles away and we never find out his ultimate fate. After the death of Moss and his wife (I still wasn't even sure at that point if Moss was really even dead), I thought, 'Ok, now it'll come down to a showdown between Tommy Lee Jones and the villain. Surely, he won't let him get away with killing the sweet, innocent wife."" Guess again! Instead, what we are treated to is this drawn out exploration of Tommy Lee Jone's internal and external relationships as he decides to call it quits! WTF is up with Hollywood?! Last weekend, I made the mistake of watching King's crapfest, defeatist ""Horror"" flick, The Mist, where all the main heroes have a suicide pact at the end rather than take their chances and fight to survive against the monster bugs. This weekend, I was treated to another defeatist ending where the aging sheriff calls it quits and decides to enjoy his pension rather than put his life on the line to kill this psychopath. Wow, there's some inspiration for the next generation... What's next? Harry Potter kills all his friends at Hogwart then himself?! 3 stars for the first 3/4 of the movie P.S. Yes, I understand ""real life"" doesn't always work out but I didn't need to waste $12 bucks and 2 1/2 hours to have it pointed out again for me. Thanks anyway.","

"Barky44","1 December 2007","I loved Fargo. It's on my own, personal Top 10. So I was very interested in No Country.The film starts out really promising. Local hick (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the bloody remnants of a drug turf war, and slinks away with a satchel of cash. Creepy hit man (Javier Bardem) hops on his trail. Long-in-the-tooth sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to head them off before carnage ensues.For about the first half, the film has great promise. Some of the sneak, counter-sneak scenes between Brolin & Bardem (like the give-and-take around the cheap motel) are suspenseful and tense. The Coen brothers start to build intrigue upon intrigue within the drug gangs themselves, leading to some real promising encounters at the end of the film.Unfortunately, the Coens let this film fall apart. For some reason, they take the focus off the criminal suspense and on to Jones' Sad Sack character. All we end up hearing is his moaning about how ""it's so hard to be a sheriff these days"". They then let the interesting hit man plot die abruptly, suck all the energy out of the film, and it dies a quiet death. I actually fell asleep during the last ten minutes or so waking up during the closing credits.The Coens really lost their way on this one. It almost looks like they got bored with the film and wanted to wrap it up quickly or something. Why they drone on about retirement, I don't know.All in all, a poor attempt from otherwise capable filmmakers. 4 out of 10.","

"plpregent","20 October 2011","Not many films accomplish what No Country For Old Men does. Coming from the Coen brothers, this slice of western-influenced, 80's style storytelling just flows in front of your eyes at a slow yet enigmatic pace, delivering a form of tension that you rarely get to see in films nowadays.To your ears, this experience will seem very intense yet pretty minimal, especially in terms of music, which is pretty much absent from the ensemble, only to leave you with the calm sounds of the windy Texas desert, dry gun cockings, the brutal sound of Chigurh's infamous tank or silenced shotgun (doing bloody damage shown in all its graphic greatness!), among many, many others. Every footstep is a part of the experience, every gun shot sounds loud and lethal, every silence builds the tension, and the almost scientific pace of NCFOM.Nowadays, music dictating how you should feel and crescendos on queue with the jump-off-your-seat moments is a common thing. Music being absent, you are left with your own nerves, and the incredible tension generated by Javier Bardem's character, one of the coldest-blooded human beings ever portrayed on film, period. What ensues is so effective and precise, it's both completely badass AND cinematically stunning.You become quite worried about this poor kid, Moss, who's being ruthlessly chased by this complete psychopath who murders anyone stepping on his path without any visible kind of emotion. With basic yet brilliant subplots involving Moss' wife, the Mexican cartel, and an ageing sheriff losing control and confidence in this whole situation, this adaptation of Cormac MacCarthy's novel will simply blow your mind if you have the slightest interest in either western cinema, genuine writing and storytelling, or minimalist cinema.Hell, whatever your favourite genre is, if you're not expecting Transformers or some other MTV-style blockbuster and have a minimal interest in auteur cinema, No Country For Old Men's experience will exceed any of your expectations.Now, what I previously called a ''subplot'' is, in fact, the whole core of the movie. It's Sheriff Bell's part. Again, it's very minimal, but it does dictate the whole narrative line of this film, and gives it its aura, its magic feeling of old people getting constantly bullied by the young, which is exactly why this film is called what it's called. And why you get this narration at the start, while witnessing some crude and cold violence, committed by a young man. Through two young men's classic western pursuit, you get an old man's struggle with the pain of getting old and feeling obsolete next to these younger, meaner wolves.This is why the ending is what it is as well. And what an ending this is! Pure brilliance. Had me smiling in admiration for 20 minutes after the film ended.A brilliant piece of cinema, just as incredible as Fargo was. Yet these are two very different films, they both shine with irresistible brilliance. Congratulations to this top-notch cast, these two incredible film-makers, this genius of a man who wrote this story, and to the whole team behind this modern-day masterpiece.","

"smatysia","9 January 2016","Well, a lot of very strong opinions in the comments section. I'm guessing that the Coens would consider that a success. I thought that the film had some very strong points. Excellent acting from Jones, Bardem, Harrelson, Brolin, and Kelly Macdonald. Nice photography and sets. (I'm pretty sure that I have stayed at one of the hotels in Las Vegas, New Mexico that served as one of them) Some memorable dialog, that may have been lifted from the McCarthy novel. Some of the extreme nihilism was a bit off-putting, but that was obviously the point. A big problem was the ending. I hate to criticize a film for being unconventional, because formulaic endings can be bad, too. There is definitely a place for films with ambiguous or undeveloped endings, although that place is usually in French art-house cinema. I did find it in need of more of a point. Perhaps I missed it.","

"evanston_dad","2 December 2007","""No Country for Old Men,"" the Coen brothers' screen adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's nailbiter of a novel, is doggedly faithful to its source, which will please fans of the book, but which is also what limits it from achieving greatness. As it is, the movie will probably and deservedly be remembered as a minor classic, but that's due more to its execution than it is its subject matter. It's as accomplished as ""Fargo,"" still the Coens' best movie in my opinion, but it doesn't carry a powerful message the way that film did, or have any characters who make a lasting impression.Josh Brolin plays a Vietnam veteran living in Texas sometime in the early 1980s who comes across a satchel of money ($2 million to be exact) at the scene of a drug deal gone bad. He takes off with it, his arrogance leading him to believe that he will be able to outsmart whoever comes looking for it. Who comes looking for it is Anton Chigurgh, a relentless psycho who's as untraceable as he is unstoppable (played by Javier Bardem). Tommy Lee Jones plays sheriff Ed Tom Bell, who provides the film with a voice over narration in which he laments the state of the world and the awful nature of crime in his day as compared to those of his dad and granddad, both sheriffs before him. In McCarthy's novel, all of this is told in clipped and deadly serious language, and it all feels more full of philosophical import than it is; it's not until you've put the book down and start thinking about it that you realize how lightweight it is. I was interested to see if the Coens would bring any depth to the material that wasn't inherently there. They don't. Therefore, the movie is supremely engrossing and suspenseful, and I hung on every scene and image they put on the screen, but it didn't feel like an important movie to me. On the other hand, who says that every movie has to be important? The Coens bring some of their trademark ghoulish humor to the film, which was welcome, because I thought McCarthy could have lightened up a bit himself in the novel. The film feels oddly unemotional, mostly because all of the principal action revolves around characters who aren't remotely sympathetic (including Brolin's, who's a bit of a jerk really, when you think about it). The warmest character in the film is Brolin's wife, played in a lovely performance by the Scottish actress Kelly McDonald, but her part is tiny, and the character herself has little to do other than look perplexed or suspicious. I thought Bardem lacked the menace necessary to pull off Chigurgh, who's more of a supernatural representation of evil than a real character; I couldn't help but think what Benicio Del Toro could have done with the role. And Woody Harrelson pops up miscast as a hit-man, in a role as pointless in the movie as it is in the book.But again, all of these weaknesses were things the Coens inherited from the source material. They've made the best movie possible of McCarthy's novel, and ""No Country for Old Men"" easily joins ""Fargo,"" ""Blood Simple,"" ""Miller's Crossing,"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" at the top of their canon.Grade: A","

"houndtang75","31 January 2008","Joel and Ethan Coen's 'No Country for Old Men' has proved to be one of the year's most critically acclaimed films, with a raft of Oscar nominations adding to its apparent lustre. On viewing though, one has to ask what all the fuss is about.The story contrives to be straightforward and opaque at the same time; trailer-trash Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) happens upon a corpse and a bag full of money in the Texan desert. As always happens in the movies, he decides to keep it for himself, thus attracting the attention of the extremely sinister Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem sporting an equally sinister pudding bowl haircut). The first three-quarters of the film are essentially about Moss trying to evade Chigurh's murderous clutches, whilst folksy but ineffectual Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) follows two steps behind. This section of the film works well as a thriller, with some tense and exciting scenes as Chigurh relentlessly pursues the resourceful Moss. However, much remains rather unclear; for instance the origin of the money is never really made clear and a bounty-hunter type character (a nice cameo from Woody Harrelson) enters and exits the story quickly and rather pointlessly.Had 'No Country' continued in the thriller vein for its two hour running time, then it would have been a strong entry in the genre, but those Oscar nods would still have been rather mystifying. However the film literally loses the plot in the last quarter, with the abrupt, off-screen death of a central character and a slow, meandering and ultimately rather pointless finale. All in all, 'No Country For Old Men' must be one of the more disappointing and over-rated films of recent years.","

"dcobbimdb","3 August 2019","This movie started off good and I was intrigued from the beginning, but then 2/3 into the movie it just does a 180 and was a total let down up to the end. Maybe I went into this expecting too much given the high rating & all, it's not like I need a happy or Hollywood ending to like a movie, but this movie was just ruined in the final act, to the point where I was kind of shell shocked, and after that wore off I was kind of pissed knowing I blew 2 hours on this. The best analogy I can give is working on a good jigsaw puzzle only to find there are missing pieces in the end, leaving you feeling cheated.Acting wise I thought Javier and Josh were great and I liked them both. Tommy & Woody were both wasted and didn't serve any point or advance the plot of the movie at all. In fact both of them could have been stripped out of the movie completely and it wouldn't have changed a single thing. Kelly was okay, but nothing specialPersonally I though the effects were kind of hokey, and very noticeable GCI when it came to certain gunshot hits and it always reminds me that practical effects always beat out GCI any day of the week, but sadly this is just the way of things I guessOverall I think the movie had a lot of potential, but it's as if they ran out of money or just tried to pull off some weird M. Night Shyamalan ending which failed miserably. It's really hard to digest and describe without directly spoiling, but in the end I was left unsatisfied and a bit confused, and not confused as in I didn't get it, but again I really can't dive into that more without giving away spoilers. If anything it teaches me to never simply go off a rating...","

"BrnzReviews","13 June 2021","No Country For Old Men is one of the greatest movies I've seen of Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones and a great first for Javier Bardem. I throughly enjoyed this movie, down to the last scene i thought it was well thought out and the way they keep you engaged in the story is truly phenomenal. This isn't your average crime thriller, this story shows you just how much stuff can go wrong when you stumble on a drug deal gone wrong and find a large amount of cash, what could go wrong.. that is with a tracker involved which makes it all the more exciting to see who lives and who dies in this epic tale of greed and out right bizarre criminals. Talking of criminals it is very criminal that I hadn't seen this, I was so entertained by every aspect of it and I have so many regrets that I didnt catch it sooner.The mind games are so iconic in this that Javier Bardem plays as Anton Chigurh, my favourite scene was the gas station, I don't involved spoilers in my reviews so that's all I'll say but I found it so chilling in the best way possible. If I caught this in the cinema I cant begin to imagine how insane it would be! Such an experience it would've been, although this was a great experience nevertheless.Highly recommend this!","

"steiner-sam","8 November 2022","It's a criminal chase film set in 1980 in the West Texas hinterlands. It follows three main characters--a local Vietnam vet who discovers a drug deal gone bad in the desert and takes the money, a psychopathic killer hired initially to recover the money, and the older sheriff trying to work out the mass of murders taking place in his usually sleepy region.The film opens with some reflections on his career by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones). He's been a lawman since he was 25, as was his father, grandfather, and uncle. We then meet Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), the psychopath, as he kills a deputy sheriff with his handcuffs. However, we never learn why he was initially arrested. Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is the local Vietnam vet who lives in a trailer with his wife, Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald). He discovers $2.0 million in drug money in the desert but soon learns the drug lords are after him.The story then follows the mutual chases--Chigurh after Moss and Bell trying to catch up with Chigurh and Moss. There is a lot of graphic violence along the way, and many folks will find the ending unsatisfactory.In some ways, this is a straightforward chase movie with many bodies. The skill of the Coen brothers in cinematic details and their attention to the West Texas setting set it apart. Tommy Lee Jones is magnificent as an aging lawman with 40 years of experience who is overwhelmed by the magnitude of the evil he is facing. Brolin is excellent as the loner vet who believes his survival in Vietnam means he'll be able to protect Carla Jean and handle Chigurh. Bardem is a believable psychopath, though that doesn't require much emotional range. There's also a cameo appearance by Woody Harrelson that seems designed only to show how skilled a killer Anton Chigurh is.""No Country for Old Men"" is a highly-crafted film, but not for people triggered by graphic violence.","

"mukava991","17 February 2008","This film seems to have the same central flaw as almost every other Coen Brothers film I've seen  it builds up fascinatingly and meticulously with great visual flair and originality, and then abandons the plot in favor of silly or wispy resolutions that aren't worth the time spent getting to them. The Man Who Wasn't There and Barton Fink come to mind. Secondly, these brothers are still writing ""quirky"" dialogue that calls attention to itself. I suppose it's ""clever"" but what else? Or is ""clever"" enough? I guess so, if the critical praise for this effort is any indication. I am reminded of some of David Lynch's villains who talk in cryptic riddles but Lynch deals with dreamscapes and the Coen Brothers are supposed to be in reality. And finally, here we have yet another serial killer / slasher / scary monster genre movie in which violent and explosive scenes of murder and mayhem occur in populated environments (a motel, a hotel, an office building in broad daylight, etc.) but no one except the central players are seen, no one calls the cops, no one intervenes, no one is around at the crucial moment  too easy and way too common as filmmakers seem to feel a need to maintain a high body count to keep the audience interested. The overall effect is cartoonish. After a while I was squirming in my seat from boredom, less and less concerned with the fates of the main characters. I was glad to see Kelly Macdonald (so memorable as Maggie Smith's long suffering and noble maid in Gosford Park) play a Texan, especially late in the story when out of the blue she shows some insight and intelligence. Josh Brolin as her rough but gentle Viet Nam vet husband matched her all the way  fine actor. Javier Bardem as the unstoppable Frankensteinish killer is truly frightening. But there is little substance beneath the cleverness and I am wondering if the strong points of this film come from the novel upon which it is said to be closely based. If any message is to be derived, it is that as time passes our society gets more and more violent and therefore this is ""no country for old men,"" but hasn't the old ""what's the world coming to?"" idea been around since the beginning of civilization?","

"Chase_Witherspoon","15 October 2012","So it's a well constructed film featuring a central villain who's uncharacteristically laconic and sadistic at the same time which is something original, but the narrative is shallow and the plot sometimes seems aimless. Jones is a retiring lawman who must investigate a spate of murders committed by Bardem, sporting a creepy hairstyle and an unusual choice of weapon in a pneumatic cattle gun. Junior Brolin is the opportunistic rancher who happens on a drug deal gone sour, seeking to profit from the mini massacre, but Bardem has other ideas and tracks his prey across the south-west.Jones is a tired looking bystander to the carnage created by the man of the moment, Javier Bardem whose star rose to prominence following his Oscar nod for this jolting, unhinged performance. Woody Harrelson has a good scene or two as a professional mercenary and pale imitation of Bardem's commitment to his chosen profession, while Tess Harper has a minor role as Jones' wife, and Barry Corbin and Stephen Root feature in supporting roles.Characterised by the typical Coen brothers style, it's epic in length and paced like a snail on valium, but thankfully, punctuated by some shocking encounters that make it a memorable experience. Not a bad film at all, but whether it's worthy of being declared the best film of its year either inflates its worth or reflects poorly on the competition.","

"carsonpayne-66437","22 August 2022","I really enjoyed this movie, so much so that it has caused me to reflect multiple times on its story and ending. I appreciated that there were so many twists in the movie that almost felt natural yet shocking. That is a very hard thing to do. The story continued and I never thought to myself, I don't like where this is heading.The antagonist is eerily realistic which added to the character development throughout the film. The acting was superb and the filmography was wholesome between the gratuitous landscape shots and fading transitions.Something I also loved about this movie is how well it used violence to convey its story. The violence, although sometimes gory, was never self-satisfying or gratuitous. The disturbing scenes always lended it's hand to the story as masterfully as a Tarantino film.","

"bluegreenbluegreen","7 May 2008","Something strange is happening in the town of Marfa. This movie is just as bad as There Will Be Blood. What is going on? The above line has more story, more interest, more movement, than either of these two movies.To be fair to No Country For Old Men, the ghost-like assassin character is well drawn, well clothed, and well played. This actor has a monumental face that is a delight to the camera. His voicing is dead-perfect. There are some good shots of bare, open, sun-shot highway, too, that just hit the right note. Also, 70's cars are cool.What's wrong: Well... No story. After a nice tease of a set up. It started like a story, but nobody really did anything that made sense.You have a man on the run; good stuff so far. He's got a girl, that's good too. You see their home, you believe his character, great. I'm on his side. Then comes a remorseless, unstoppable, killer, not of this world, who seeps over everything like a black cloud of death. Cool.Then you realize you're following the wrong character- this movie isn't about the prey, or the predator either.. it's about the superfluous sheriff, remorselessly pursued by his own black cloud of getting too old and not giving a damn. He struggles weakly against the approaching cloud and then philosophically gives in to it.In the mean-time we watch other people offer themselves up to the black cloud of the assassin. Eventually, at no particular point, the silent black credits slam in.The above makes this movie sound like it might be entertaining, or at least about something. It isn't.The sheriff has exactly one great, topical, line. While dismounting his horse at a scene of great carnage - the desolate big-time drug and money exchange gone bad - he adds a fillip to his deputy's half-successful attempt at manly-lawman-understatement of the grisly scene: In response to the deputy's comment the sheriff says ""well there does appear to have been something of a glitch.."" - or something like that. It's so good, that it is almost enough to save the sheriff, but , sadly, it is not enough.Also, while the movie looks like Texas, many of the characters seem a Texan parody of the flatest, thinest sort.I thought the woman motel clerk was wonderful. And have no quarrel with the Scottish girl's accent or portrayal as the young texan wife. The husband played well enough, too. But for what.This movie has a very bad spirit, and nothing to justify it. May it's own black cloud hasten to catch up to it soon.","

"Screen_Blitz","25 June 2017","Life in west is violent, at least that is what many cinematic entries in the western genre lead you to believe. Hollywood moguls Joel and Ethan Coen take on the audacious of taking the pages of Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name and spinning it into cinematic proportions. It is significantly difficult feat to pull as McCarthy's sophisticated style of writing have lead many to believe translating his works into films are far too easier said than done. In spite of this, it appears that no one's directing methodology is a suitable match of McCarthy's writing other than the Coen Brothers. In a splendid effort, the masterminds behind such projects as 'Fargo', 'The Big Lebowski', and their debut 'Blood Simple' bring McCarthy's western tale to life in an pure enthralling fashion. It is violent, gory, and unquestionably dark in tone. But beneath the surface is immersive talent of the Coen Brothers who more than effectively uproot a tale of fate, conscious, and perplexing morality. Set in 1980, this film follows Southern Texas native Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin), a retired Vietnam veteran who goes on a hunting trip only to come across a string of dead bodies in what appears to have been a drug deal gone awry. Upon investigating the gruesome scene, he gets a hold of a suitcase containing a few million dollars. While Llewelyn manages to run away with it in attempt to make it to the Texas border, a sadistic sociopath Anton Chigurh (played by Javier Bardem) sets out to retrieve it, leading to a series of grisly murders. Meanwhile, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones) goes the run to investigate the increasing body count.If the violence and bloodshed don't serve as a detriment to sitting through this two-hour work of art, then you are in for beautiful ride. After all, it is the Coen Brothers behind the wheel of this cinematic endeavor. Continuing on their signature methodology of mixing violence with darky, wry humor and eccentric characters, the Coens bring a masterful sleight of hand in operating the story of a bloody cat-and-mouse game where the fate of each character is unpredictable. The biggest show stealer here is Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh, a nihilistic, violence-hungry mastermind who becomes the driving force behind the briskly paced plot. He is a man with a complex sense of morality and shows little to no mercy on anyone who crosses his path. Each second he shows up on screen, things get very suspenseful within the blink of an eye. Coming face-to-face with each individual, Chigurh has a questionable of determining their fate, and that is flipping a corn and ordering them to guess it. If the Coens prove anything, one of them is that sometimes silence can be more nerve-racking than the presence of suspenseful music. And the best part is that the film does not need an eerie music score to portray its suspense. The dialogue and Bardem's unforgettable delivery firmly gets the job done. If you find yourself laughing, the chances are it is an uncomfortable one. (And let's not forget Roger Deakins's admirable camera-work put into the mix) As for Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones, both manage to give some decent performances, the latter of whom adds a sense of dark humor to the atmosphere with his sharp dialogue. Woody Harrellson plays a small role and does a fine job, but his time on screen is rather short. Kelly MacDonald, a Scottish actress showing off with her nifty Southern accent, gives a nice portrayal as the lead character's wife. Again not too much screen time. No Country for Old Men is violent, yet masterfully crafted western thriller uprooted by the directorial talent of the Coen Brothers. It is an astounding cinematic gem that proves why the Coens are such a respected filmmaking duo. At best, it stands in the front ranks of cinematic entries of the modern western genre. As for Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones; these three deserve a round of applause.","

"blanbrn","19 January 2008","""No Country for Old Men"" is without a doubt one of the better films I've seen in a long time. It's well mixed with suspense, drama, action, and intrigue the entire time to keep the viewer on the edge. Yet many may feel like me and feel displeased at the ending, but the Coen brothers wanted everyone to form their own call and to think about the right closure. The scenes are well done too and the acting is super especially from veterans Brolin and Jones.Set across the state of Texas mostly in rural sites and crossing over to some metro areas the film is a joyride from the start. Beginning with hunter Llewelyn Moss(Josh Brolin)who makes a gruesome discovery of dead bodies and also a stash of cash like two million from an apparent drug deal gone wrong near Rio Grande and the Mexican and American border. From then on the action and journey begins when ruthless and cold stoned looking criminal thug Anton Chigurh(Javier Bardem who plays the part brilliant)goes hot on the trail of the missing cash all across the state from car chases to even a hotel shootout. Many of the scenes are memorable like that of Anton's flipping of the coin to decide the life and fate of the store clerk by heads or tails! The Coen brothers use the cat and mouse theme so well between these two central characters so well it makes the film even more enjoyable to watch.Yet at a half point of the film it feels a little odd when Woody Harrelson enters as bounty hunter Carson Wells which in my opinion was a wild card character that the Coen brothers used but why who knows. The leader and weight of the film is carried by the Tommy Lee Jones character that of veteran and old timer type burned out Texas sheriff Bell. The film opens with narration and closes with narration from the Bell character. And as always watching and hearing Tommy Lee is special, as his character feels out of touch as time and life has passed him up in which many can relate and feel for when they watch.Overall ""No Country for Old Men"" is highly enjoyable and entertaining to watch and intelligently done from the Coen brothers. In my opinion I didn't really like the ending, but many films leave the viewer to form their own take and make the call for themselves adding more suspense and intrigue to the enjoyment. Still the strong performances from Jones, Bardem and Brolin along with the films action and suspenseful journey of drama make it a clear winner and instant classic.","

"MrOllie","19 August 2011","This film had some interesting and exciting moments - but should never have been an Oscar winner. There are simply too many silly happenings or in a lot of cases no happenings at all. Overall, there are three main characters in this film i.e., Chigurh(the killer played by Javier Bardem))Moss (the red-neck who steals the money- played by Josh Brolin) and Ed Tom Bell (The Sheriff - played by Tommy Lee Jones). It starts with the psycho killer (Chigurh) being arrested and handcuffed by a young policeman. The policeman takes him to the police station, sits him down on a chair, and then foolishly turns his back on him and makes a telephone call. The killer with amazing dexterity and all the skills of an expert Escapologist manages to contort his body so that his hands and handcuffs are not behind his back anymore but in front of his stomach. The policeman is then garroted with great aplomb by Chiqurh. The killer (who is trying to locate a bag with $2 million dollars in it stolen by Moss the red-neck) then goes on to kill many other people and to blow out door locks with either a cattle stun gun which is powered by a large oxygen cylinder, or a rifle with the biggest silencer you will ever see. Surely, therefore, someone will soon spot this madman and his oxygen cylinder and inform the army of police, who you assume by now must be hunting him. But No - because incredibly the only person looking for him is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell who spends most of his time delivering long rambling monologues or reading newspapers. So of course the Sheriff never finds Chiqurh and because he is getting old and despairing of the modern world, retires. In the meantime, the other main character Moss (played by Josh Brolin)had stumbled upon an ill-fated drug deal and finds many dead bodies. One of the gang is still only just alive and asks for water but Moss cannot help him. Moss eventually finds a case with 2 million dollars inside it. Hence the reason Chiqurh is looking for him. He takes said case and goes back to his wife, they eventually go to bed but for some strange reason he gets up in the middle of the night and returns to the scene of the drug massacre carrying a bottle of water,presumably for the injured drug dealer who by now must be dead anyway. A rather daft thing to do. The film rambles on with a brief appearance from Woody Harrelson who wears a large hat but does nothing else. This film has it's moments and is not a complete disaster but, overall, it is confusing and rather silly with a truly appalling ending.","

"ronakkotian","25 February 2021","After seeing a couple films from The Coen Brothers during the last few months, I couldn't believe how amazing and talented they are as filmmakers. Inside Llewyn Davis was my favourite Coen Brothers film until now.No Country for Old Men entwines the lives of a hunter, a sheriff and a killer in Texas when a drug deal goes wrong and a bag full of cash is involved.With No Country for Old Men, The Coen Brothers revisit the Wild West but this time with a modern spin to it and I dug it all the way through. This has quickly become my favourite Coen Brothers film so far and with how high this film sets the bar, it will be really difficult to top this in my opinion. This is easily the darkest film I've seen from them and they do a great job establishing that. The gorgeous lighting and dark colour tones create an eerie and brooding atmosphere to this world. I also noticed early on the absence of music which was a choice that felt very purposeful and added to the tension. I don't think I've ever felt so tense during a film before. There were countless scenes where I felt my heart beating faster than ever before and it's due to the spectacular editing and direction by the Coens. This film is a great example of how you don't need music to make a scene more dramatic or intense.The performances are all fantastic. Josh Brolin gives one of his best here. He nails the accent plays Llewelyn Moss to the best of his ability. Tommy Lee Jones is equally terrific. There's so much going on with his character and he plays such an essential role to the themes of the film which I believe he fulfilled. The actor who really stands out here is Javier Bardem in the best performance of his career. Bardem embodies the menacing yet odd nature of Anton Chigurh so perfectly. It's a career-defining performance that won't be forgotten. Kelly Macdonald is amazing despite her short role and nails the accent completely. Woody Harrelson also does a great job with his role.I should have seen the ending coming considering how The Coen Brothers never go down the traditional route. It may disappoint some people but I found it to be thought-provoking. In many ways it made me think over the entire film and what it was trying to say. On the surface level this film may just be a suspense thriller but beneath that there are many layers to each character and situation. Like many of the Coens' films, there's so much to think about and discuss and I don't think I'll stop anytime soon.All in all, No Country for Old Men is a Coen Brothers masterpiece. It's dark, gritty and suspenseful throughout with exquisite filmmaking and exceptional writing. Anton Chigurh is one of the most interesting and enigmatic villains I've been exposed to and I cannot wait to watch it again and analyse it to a further degree.","

"benoit-3","11 March 2008","I had just started watching this on DVD when I very nearly lost my dinner after just two acts of egregious violence in the first minutes of the film. And this was only the prelude. I'm very sorry that the Academy felt it had to crown this kind of demented bloodbath with a prize. This is just more of the same old snuff porn that has been making the rounds of Hollywood since at least ""The Godfather"", except now it's being directed by the usually incomprehensible and slow-as-molasses Coen Brothers, who seem to have decided to exchange art for profit, this time around, by following the psychopathic-killer-on-a-rampage gravy train all the way to the bank and giving the dumbed-down US public what they really crave: a virtual murder spree à la Grand Theft Auto with lots of comic book horror. Not that you couldn't see that coming all the way back with ""Blood Simple"", of course... In short, this is just the sort of sadistic entertainment Nazis must have craved after a hard day's work at Dachau or Büchenwald. So why did we fight and win that war exactly?","

"gargamel_gargamel","15 April 2008","I have seen a LOT of the negative reviewers here spouting comments about the movie that are inaccurate. i.e... that Josh Brolin played an officer... he did not. that Bardem's character had no motivation... um, he was hired to track down the money that was involved in the drug transaction. That we are not shown the people behind the drug deal.... um, who cares, that's not what the movie is about. that people in Texas don't talk/act like that... I live in Texas and have spent a lot of time in FAR west Texas and I can tell you, 28 years ago, that is pretty darned close to how it was... that Moss missed the deer at the beginning.... no, he wounded it and was following it's trail when he came across the pit bull that he then followed it's back trail to the ""o.k. corral."" ( and let's see any of you even hit that target from what looked to be at least 150 yards). that there were no police looking for this ""serial killer"".... several times Bell or some other person mentioned the FBI going out to the scene several times...other lawmen he came in contact with obviously knew about all of the killings showing that the news had been circulated and people were looking for this guy.Bottom line, if you pay attention you will understand a lot more of the movie and enjoy it more as well.Brolin did a great job with his character. There were a couple of ""why would he do that"" moments that are more the fault of holding true to the book than anything else (like returning to the desert with water for a man who is almost certainly dead already). However, he was very believable... and I liked how he was killed off screen. It was more surprising that way rather than having a build up of anticipation and knowing what is about to happen.Bardem was brilliant and his character was great. People say why did he do this or why did he do that.... bottom line, he was insane. He was delusional. He has his own rules and he does abide by them. Crazy people don't fit the mold of normal logic and/or morals. In the book he even turns the money over to a third party at the end... A) proving that he did in fact get the money (for you nay-sayers) and B) showing that since he took the job he would finish it.. even though he could have kept the money... he had agreed to bring it to it's owner.And Tommy Lee was great for the part he needed to play. His ruminations are there to get us into his head as the book did... that is something that never transmits to a screenplay very well. However, it was fun thinking after the movie about what he meant... was he talking about his own death?.... did he feel Bardem would come after him? did the dream about losing money mean that he lost something valuable in not being able to protect the Mosses from death? Nobody knows for sure, maybe not even the author.... these are things that make a movie good people. And sometimes the bad guy wins... in life even more than in the movies. Deal with it.Overall I gave an 8 because of some of the original plot problems from the book. The acting was great, the cinematography was great, the audio was of course great, and the story is great.It is a 4 of 5 on the Gargamel Scale. Bringing 1 for acting, 1 for car chases, 1 for explosions/gunfire, and 1 for story. It misses the 1 for nudity which would have been out of place in this movie... and given the great amount of gunfire/explosions and wonderful acting.... I'll boost it to a 4.5... there ya go.","

I knew who Josh Brolin knew to get the part. The acting was so so, with the exceptions of Javier, and Woody Harrelson. Movie was choppy with onset of Mr. Harrelsons character. It was downhill from that point. To compare this movie to a food, it was swiss cheese because there were lots of holes in it. I hope this movie does NOT clean up at any elite awards celebrations. Incidentally with my 6 rating I was a lot kinder than my girlfriend to the rating of the movie. Its the good thing shes not a computer buff otherwise there would be another 1 rating. In closing, I hope the ending of my rating of this movie was better than the lame ending of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.","

"kenjha","4 April 2008","From their very first film, the marvelous ""Blood Simple,"" the Coen brothers have displayed a terrific visual style. This film is no exception, featuring some beautiful scenes as well as as some well-executed action. Unfortunately it's all style, no substance. It starts off well but is undone by a very unsatisfying denouement. Too much time is spent on Jones' opaque and uninteresting monologues. The plot is confusing and full of holes, with irrelevant characters wandering in and out who are not even introduced to the audience. It seems as if the Coens lost interest at some point and decided to release the film unfinished and rough around the edges. Quite disappointing.","

"giantpanther","12 February 2008","5 out of 10 is generous, my thoughts on this film have shifted, from at one point considering it one of the top five of the year to now considering it to be a film full of exaggeration and hyperbole.I respect the Coens, I loved Fargo and Raising Arizona, they seem to be in a world all of there own. The problem is sometimes its not worth taking the ride with them, they seem to be exploring cinematic terrain and while that is notable you have to understand that there will be some wrong turns. No Country for Old Men is one such wrong turn, they seem to almost be toying with the audience, finding joy in making an almost completely backwards movie. Pay no attention to the trailer it will tell you nothing.You think this movie revolves around Brolin, it actually is a film with three leads, Brolin, Bardem, and Jones. Eventually shifting to Jones near the end.I know there's symbolism, and some of it is meant to be deep. I know this, but I just didn't like the film. Sometimes a film is praised just for being unusual, and this is certainly the case here.","

"JohnMcClane88","13 August 2008","I have never been more disappointed in a major movie in my entire life! I just watched this for the first time last night and I knew going into it that there was a lot of talk about the ending of this movie and how many didn't like it, And now I know why.*Spoilers...Like I care! The fact that the Josh Brolin character was killed or that his wife was killed or even that the Javier Bardem character got away is not the point, all that if written well is fine.The Problem is, and its a big one! Is that they WAY they did it! After investing, what 90 minutes? (or however amount of time it was, 3/4 of the movie) into the Josh Brolin character and a great cat and mouse game with him and the Javier Bardem character the unthinkable happens! All of the SUDDEN the Josh Brolin character is Dead!!! And how does he die? Not by Javier Bardem character! But by a bunch of mexicans that we NEVER see! We or the Tommy Lee Jones character just HAPPENS to come across Josh Brolin laying dead! WHAT????????????????????????? I invest all this time into these two guys and what do I get for my time? NOTHING!!!! What a FREAKEN Waste of my time!! After that happened I turned to my wife and said, ""Do you think Josh Brolin upset the Coen brothers that day and they just wrote him out of the movie?"" LOL What a Joke! That was the most cheated I ever felt about a movie.Not too mention that whole scene with Tommy Lee Jones and Barry Corbin, after just being cheated that scene was like nails on a chalkboard! I give the first 3/4 of the movie up until Josh Brolin dies a solid 8! The rest of the movie after he dies, I give it a MINUS, yes MINUS -7!!! For a grand total of a stinken 1!!! GIVE ME BACK MY 122 MINUTES!!","

"DAHLRUSSELL","25 March 2008","This film is not one I would sit through if I were not voting on it, and it is a film that I truly regret watching. There are memorable moments of psychopathic cruelty portrayed here that I never needed in my memory. I don't ever want to see a snuff film, and I don't ever need to see viable facsimiles of them. (And NO, memorable does not mean it is a good film, it just means that film images are very potent.) My father is a huge fan of westerns and of Tommy Lee Jones, hated this film. He watches most films multiple times and will not watch this again.This film IS completely relevant in terms of history, border wars, drug wars, illegal immigration, and the impotence of our law enforcement to deal with ingrained attitudes of immorality and an insane level of escalation.The acting is why I gave this a 2 instead of 1(awful): Javier Bardem is not a supporting player, he is a lead - he causes all the action throughout the film, and he DID deserve any acting award for his excellent, nuanced portrayal of the gradual degradation of this disturbed individual. Excellent lamb-like performance by Kelly Macdonald in a thankless role. (I love her. She starred in ""Gosford Park."" But come on... we have hundreds of brilliant American stage actresses who could have done this supporting role.) Josh Brolin does a great job with a well-scripted role of an ethically bankrupt everyday ""hero."" Tommy Lee Jones does what he can with a very impotent role. It had to be a star of his gravitas to make anything memorable of that role.But relevance and accuracy are not enough to make something ""art."" Nihilism is no answer, and it certainly is NOT entertainment. Folks - with all the power and potential of this medium, is this really the best we can do? Imitate the worst of humanity?Not Debatable: RECORD low numbers watching of the Oscars this year; even with all the additional news/publicity &the hype about the writers's strike potentially canceling it. Debatable: This film and the morally blank and hope-deficient films of this year are directly accountable for the lack of interest in the Oscars or film in general. Of course something else that turns people off the Oscars is this kind of ""positioning"" a lead actor as a supporting actor to help ensure that he wins the supporting award.","

"Zac_La_Porte","28 November 2021","The Coen brothers definitely master in heavy themes and fascinating characters, but there's a significant spark missing, making No Country for Old Men one of the most overrated films of 2007. It's such a pity, especially considering that the lost crumb is a large component and can overshadow plenty of gloom that this film just happened to stagger upon.A lot of big, compelling and award-winning elements are utterly, but not entirely, crushed by the lack of this spark. You'd think from every other section of the film that it would be perfect. No Country for Old Men is effective in several senses, including its ability to totally avoid background soundtrack, feature engrossing character development and a very interesting storyline. Not only do Joel and Ethan Coen focus with excellent direction, but the actors and the entire design in general are also brilliant.But there's just one thing: they're all a little overrated. Is it the actual performances and filmmaking crew that's overrated, or is it just the flatness? Actually, and saying again, the lack of rapidity is destroying the best things about this could've-been-masterpiece. The plot is great, but the dividing of it throughout a 2 hour runtime eliminates the ability to be compelling and leaves it half empty. The difficulty to concentrate is also an additional result.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

"michaelRokeefe","23 February 2008","Joel and Ethan Coen cunningly adapts a story by Cormac MaCarthy that is set in 1980s West Texas. A beginning with so much anticipation; and a fade to black finale with your's truly expounding...s^@t! Llewelyn Moss(Josh Brolin)is a redneck slave to his resources that while hunting in the dusty Texas desert stumbles upon a drug deal gone real bad. Bodies of Mexican gangsters bullet-ridden and swarmed by flies lay by expended weapons. Moss coolly ignores a damn pickup load of drugs, but eagerly grabs a grip on a briefcase full of $2 million in $100 bills. He doesn't realize that he will soon be chased by a psychotic hit-man, Anton(Javier Bardem). This is the most methodical, ruthless, no nonsense killer in movie history. One unstoppable bad ass. Small town Sheriff Ed Tom Bell(Tommy Lee Jones)personally knows how determined and crazy Anton is and will try to track down Llewelyn and save him if possible. At the same time joining in the chase is the high dollar bounty hunter Carson Wells(Woody Harrelson), who is hired to stop Anton. Desert landscapes are photographed beautifully. The violence is bitter and most definite.Llewelyn is too damn stubborn for his own good. He seems to not know the meaning of quit. He is a welder by trade, but $2 million in a briefcase means retirement. Anton is ultimate in regard to being the most psycho killer to take unnerving joy in his obsession with everyone's destiny and gives the flip of a coin a whole new meaning. Sheriff Bell is pretty much borderline old codger with pride in the old school of enforcing the law. Wells is cocky, fearless and not too afraid of death. The murder rate is brisk and guaranteed to speed your pulse. Also in the cast: Kelly Macdonald, Tess Harper, Barry Corbin and Stephen Root. Thanks to the Cohen brothers for this bleak guilty pleasure.","

"tabuno","21 January 2019","21 November 2007. Warning: Spoilers. Splash something different on the screen, an antisocial personality disorder man, throw in some dialogue that purports to sound important, include some manipulated twists and turns and it appears many people classify this movie as great. Unfortunately underneath its dazzling presentation lurks predictability, unbelievable coincidences, outstanding idiotic behavior from characters who should know better. This movie really is like the emperor without any clothes on. The movie appears to be good, but really it more flash than substance. Even the very first scene was predictable and rather dumb where a supposedly ignorant law enforcement officer ends up on the wrong end of the handcuffs. We have a antisocial personality disorder killer who we don't get to see really what he eventually does half the time (it's left up to the imagination of the audience). Does he or doesn't he? He escapes incredulously without killing in one scene just like incredulously this box of money seemingly escapes without a sound. There's supposedly this professional who can protect people who can't protect himself. There's even a out-of-date tracking device that looks like something from the forties (wrong movie, I guess). There's too much taken from granted in this movie. There isn't enough real character development, tense face-offs, resolutions. Very disappointing movie from beginning to end based on the expectations going in. Six out of Ten Stars.","

"lotus_chief","31 January 2008","**SPOILERS!** Naturally I watched this due to all of the hype and praises surrounding it. I just don't get it. Although, seeing the Coen Brothers' name attached to this film, I should have known better. The first film I saw by them was Miller's Crossing.hated it. Finally rented Fargo from Netflix a month ago, watched it, wasn't impressed at allin fact I was annoyed by it. Third time's a charm, maybe? Not by a long shot.The Coens always have a high level of quirkiness to their films. Everything from the characters to the plot is a little off-kilter. This does NOT always translate into a great, intelligent film. Tarantino also possess this quality with his films and, a lot more so than not, it works. Not the case with the Coens, as their attempts always come off as forced. Stripped of any fluff, 'No Country For Old Men' is a film full of killing and rambling. First there's the hit-man, (Javier Bardem) who barely talks (and when he does, talks about coin tosses and other mundane things), walks around with a oxygen tank and a shotgun with a silencer (didn't know it was possible, but I must admit its kinda cool), blowing locks off doors and killing cops and honest citizens wherever he deems fit with no consequence to his actions from authorities, etc. There's the aging sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) who's becoming more detached from the world every day, due to its increasing insanity. Supposedly the movie is titled around this character, but he's only in about a third of the film, if that. Last but not least, there's the 'good-bad guy' (Josh Brolin), the silhouette you see in the movie's poster with the bag of money & rifle. He's another wanderer who happens to stumble on $2 million and a truckload of drugs, swipes the money and spends the rest of his time AROUND TOWN eluding the aforementioned hit-man who is after him. This is a guy who, while swiping the money, blows off the only remaining survivor's request for water; only to get up out of bed hours later in the middle of the night, fill a container of water and go BACK there with hopes of seeing that same survivor still clinging on to dear life. Needless to say, his hopes were squashed, and his problems multiplied tenfold when the people whose money/drugs were unaccounted for show up. We get an elongated cameo from another character (Woody Harrelson) who has a decent amount of screen time but whose character serves ABSOLUTELY NO PURPOSE to the story. As soon as we're introduced to him, he's done away with. The audience is forced to identify with Brolin's character because we follow him throughout his quest to make out with the money. Only problem is, he meets his fate in the most uninspiring, anti-climatic way possible. We see him alive, *cut*, we hear sirens, *cut*, we see him dead. We can only assume the hit-man got him.You'll also hear a lot about the ending to this film, if anyone can call it such. In a nutshell, hit-man gets to Brolin's wife, rambles on again about a coin toss (which she fails to participate in), cut to hit-man in a car leaving the scene when a horrible accident occurshe gives a kid $100 for his shirt and he walks away limping and bloody with a bone sticking out his arm. Cut to the aging sheriff again, who is now retired, talking to his wife about a dream he had about his father, black screen, the end. What a bunch of wannabe artsy NONSENSE! If you're going to tell a story, TELL IT! Enough of the spaced-out dialog and characters who do nothing to further the telling of the story. There must be something I'm not getting; 'Fargo' reeked of these attempts at this kind of humor and failed miserably; between beyond-annoying accents and a ho-hum approach to everything by everyone made it one of the most overrated films of the past 10 years. 'NCFOM' suffers from the same affliction. They go above and beyond to make things as 'weirdly fascinating', only covering up the lack of a coherent script and plot. I can suspend my disbelief to a point, depending on what type of film it is. But please, DON'T pass yourself off as a ""serious, intelligent crime drama"".only to have all these occurrences in your movie that makes absolutely no sense! You mean to tell me NO one gets wind of the hit-man walking around town as obvious as can be.even after he kills a policeman at the police station? I'm not even going to mention how he gets out of the handcuffs. You bring in Woody Harrelson's character whose led out to be some sort of bad ass who's eliminated ever so easilyhe minus well have played the idiot cop who turned his back on a prisoner and was strangled with handcuffs. Brolin waking up and going BACK to the crime scene that HE stole drug money from, taking water with him hoping the Mexican (or whatever he was) is still alive? HOURS later?? Beyond silly, over-pretentious crap, this movie is. I was seriously considering watching it again to see what I missed.but what's the point? The movie is flat-out garbage. How the Coens continue to get over on critics is beyond me.This will probably win a bunch at the Oscars, and it'll be yet another slap in the face to anyone who goes about life with sense. Then again, the Oscars really don't mean much of anything nowadays.Cuba Gooding Jr. now does Hanes commercials screaming about wearing other guys' underwear, 'Shawshank Redemption' to this day is better than 'Forrest Gump', and no one's heard from Roberto Benigni since 'Life Is Beautiful'. Want to see one of the truly great films of 2007 snubbed by the Academy? Watch 'Gone Baby Gone'. Stay away from this trash by all means.3/10","

"Floated2","2 March 2018","No Country for Old Men has been widely praised by critics and considered one of the greater films of its release year as well as of the decade. This film may be classified as a perfectly realized modern day western thriller which combines moments of hard-edged violence, several sequences of suspense, frequent interjections of deliciously dry and laconic humor, and flashes of how not only the world has changed but the way our perspectives do as we get older. Much of the suspense comes from the cjaracter of Javier Bardem, as he steals his scenes. Josh Brolin is one of his earlier star turning roles, delivers a masterful performance. With these performances, is the main reason as to why this film is as great, as well as the directing and overall visuals of the scenery. The violence stands out in the film as graphic and it works in its favor. Overall, No Country is a well made drama, though a film not for everyone.","

"DaveDiggler","28 March 2008","""No Country for Old Men"" has it all. It's a chase film, but it's also subdued with symbolism and subtly. The acting is top notch and everybody has heard of Javier Bardem' great performance, but I think the real standout comes from Josh Brolin- in a career year- as Llewelyn Moss. Tom Lee Jones gives a powerhouse performance in subtly which only fits the nature and the tone of the film. Kelly McDonald is fantastic as Llewelyn' wife. When those two share a scene we really get a great understanding of their relationship in just a few moments here and there. Woody Haralson will remind you why he's an actor with a very good performance as a bounty hunter.The film starts and ends with Tommy Lee Jones' character, Ed Tom Bell. He has been a Sheriff since he was 25 years old with a history of lawmen dating back to his grandfather. Late in his career and late in life Ed Tom struggles with his past, future and legacy. He always questions whether or not the old timers would be proud of him because he's not proud of himself. He feels as if the world is changing; the violence is changing; man is changing and he can't keep up anymore. He's being passed by, by the younger man much like his dream with his younger father. Ed Tom is slowing down and the people he's chasing are moving faster until they stop and start a fire. Only then does he catch up. Once he get's there he knows he'll face something he doesn't understand and he'll have to put his motto at risk: ""I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job. But, I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand."" The evil he chases is cunning, smart, dark, and almost invisible until the final moments where fate steps in and delivers what's coming.As Bell is the focus of the film, Anton Chigurh, is the driving force in the film. His evil is destructive, it's overwhelming, it's senseless, and it's the fate of a coin toss. Anton' evil is best shown in a gas station scene where he subtly threatens the life of a gas station proprietor. The dialogue in the scene is incredible and it's the Coen' at their best. After the gas station proprietor infuriates Chigurh, because of his stupid questions, Anton decides to let fate step in and settle the dispute in a coin toss. As he crinkles up a candy wrapper, and lets it go, it becomes out of the hands of Chigurh. Fate has stepped in and the coin that has been traveling for 22 years is now here and that will decide whether the man lives or dies. It's his call and its either heads or tails. Chigurh can't call it for him, but he is his fate since he and the coin arrived at the same time. Chigurh simply doesn't care what the result is, but there has to be a result. Another great scene which shows Chigurh' Grim Reaper like evil is where one man watches another man die right in front of him at the hands of Chigurh. The man absurdly asks; ""Are you going to kill me?"" and Chigurh turns around and looks right into his eyes with a grin on his face and responds with an absurd question of his own, ""Do you see me?"" Moss is a simple man. A Vietnam War veteran. A man with a determination to find a way out of the life he currently inhabits as greed and fortune take over his fate. He tries to run. He tries to get away and live happily ever after and he believes he will even after he is ""immobilized"" by a gun shot wound from Chigurh. Like any person, Moss follows mans evil on a hunting trip as he tracks down the blood trail of a wounded dog. He follows the trail back and finds a slaughtering and Mexican Drug deal gone horribly wrong. Moss finds a man in need of water and he tells him he ""ain't got no water."" He smartly figures out there has to be money somewhere and figures one man was left and ran off. So he searches out for the ""last man standing,"" leaving the other man dying of thirst. Moss comes to a shade tree and through his eyes we can see a figure next to the tree. He waits for movement, and then he walks to the tree and finds a dead man with a satchel full of money. His fate doesn't involve a coin toss, but rather a satchel full of money and a transponder. This will bring Chigurh to Moss.The films end will leave viewers dissatisfied because the final act of the film is quite different than the first two acts. The final act isn't shot in the vast, empty hot lands of western Texas, but in an urbanized environment in the city. This goes well with the change of Bell' character. The terrain is not his costume. It's not his country. The final act is fast paced unlike the first two. There are no horses. There are more than pistols- machine guns. The violence is no longer shown. It's shown through a spilt milk bowl or Chigurh checking his boots. The violence takes a backstage seat where the first two acts are loaded with violence pushing on excessive. As the film unravels like the candy wrapper, Bell's fate steps in. He goes back to the big crime scene. He sees and knows what's on the other side of that door. He knows he is putting his soul at hazard. He's pushing his chips to the middle of the table and he enters in the face of evil where fate takes over.","

"Dr_Coulardeau","9 February 2008","This film makes Cormac MacCarthy's style ten times more powerful because it provides the words and metaphors with images that are slowly unwrapped and disentangled from the unbearable reality of life. The USA have reached a point when history is the only master of the game, master of ceremonies. The USA have produced a situation that will resolve itself by using its own contradictions till the whole world is destroyed if necessary. This world is dominated by money that has to be easy and does not have to be clean, even would I say that is to be dirty: that gives it more taste and flavor. The world is dominated by the hunger of overstuffed men for anything that will satiate this hunger with something unreal, surreal, over-real: let it be a powder, an injection or whatever but let it erase the darkness of the night, even in the middle of the day, and cultivate some kind of visionary illusion. Then add the third dimension of this world seen through the distorting glass of the USA: violence not for the sake of making anyone suffer. That is no longer funny. Torturing is the pleasure of the simple minded. We are dealing here with a totally psychotic and asocial schizophrenic who can only find his satisfaction, his fun, his pleasure in imposing death in the cleanest way possible. And if a bullet does not suffice let's have a second to prevent any useless suffering. The USA in their immense hunger for money and drugs, speculation and hunger, accumulation and greed, have attracted on to themselves the worst killers ever, the worst predators ever, the worst rotten-meat-eaters you can imagine. They prosper on manure that they distillate in their speculative bank practices. They thrive on human garbage they concentrate in their appropriative confiscation of all they see and cannot accept not to have. Some try to play cat and mouse with them but these are not the cat and the cat knows it and the cat cannot accept any escape. The sheriff though will survive because he will realize the vulture is wounded less than two yards from him and he the lawman will walk away without confronting him. He will resign due to his cowardice and he will dream his father in a typical posture of the Trail of Tears celebrating the end of the Indian genocide, but carrying a horn full of fire as if Satan did not have any matches. No hope for the average American who wishes to have eternal life in this world without death and perfect innocence in a time when even new-born babies are soiled with the grossest crimes and desires imaginable. A hairless teenager at the end will find five hundred dollars kind of not enough for a five dollar Wal Mart shirt sold to the hyena who disappears when no survivor is any longer blocking his way. Pure darkness in which black finds darker shades of black to even make the absence of any light seem to be too light still to be realistic.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines","

Otherwise I would have given it a 4 at best.If this film didn't have big names attached, it wouldn't have gotten all the buzz it did. It only confirms what I have thought about 'Oscar caliber' movies. Big names = good rating. Overall it was a slasher film for the pseudo intellectuals. It started out pretty good then denigrated into being a pointless blood and guts slasher film. The ending with the bad guy getting away and the sheriff wandering yapping at other old men then talking to his wife about some non sequitur dreams he had was confusing and pointless.","

"ironhorse_iv","21 February 2019","Based upon, author, Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel of the same name; there is no doubt, 'No Country for Old Men' was an amazing movie. This film written and directed by the Coen Brothers was mostly entertaining from beginning into the end. However, there were some flaws. Such in the case of pacing. This Academy Award-winning best picture crime drama and neo-western really takes its sweet time, telling the story of a disillusion elderly cop, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), having to find & protect an West Texas resident Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) whom recovered stolen drug money in a drug deal gone bad, before a psychotic and sociopathic hitman, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) and the Mexican Cartels get a hold of him. Without spoiling this motion picture masterpiece, too much, while the game of cat & mouse story is a bit slow at parts, mostly in the opening & the subverted your expectations off-screen ending with Moss was a bit annoying. I still love this film. Glad, the Coen Brothers did cut out a few of the unneeded moments from the book, such as Moss picking up a hitchhiker. Nevertheless, most of the scenes, they did left, didn't felt unsatisfying & too scattered during most of the movie. The only one that was a bit bothersome was the swimming pool chat. I really don't get, why that was in the film. Nevertheless, while, the story is not that original, as there is striking similarities regarding the storyline and setting to 1973's crime thriller film 'Charley Varrick' aka 'The Last of the Independents"" directed by Don Siegel & the 1968's novel 'The Looters' by author John H. Reese. One thing, the source material and film does well, is explores the human struggle toward trying to define the frameworks of code of ethics and morality, both within the perspective of the story's heroes and the villains with a minimal use of dialogue. I like how, each of the three main characters, has their own set of ideas of what that can be. Some of them, are very tired of the gruesome violent nature of humanity & struggles to find a moral center within it, to a point that they often abandon their authentic duties, due to being fearful. Others are not, like that; some function in a moral framework given to them by society, either by social norms, family or faith. However, the most chilling character in the film is the one driven by his own internal framework. His actions do not fall either, pragmatism or moral duty. That person operates outside of any sane understanding of morality and ethics, and continually raises conflicting philosophical questions to his victims often with a game of luck and chance with a coin toss. The only thing, he knows, is no matter, what people chose how to live life, death comes to us, all, either fast or slow. In his eyes, we all cattle, that one day, will be slaughter. We all, living pieces of meat. This is his mindset. No wonder, why his choice of weapon, the air powered bolt gun stronger symbolically his views. It's a powerful comparison. The actor, Bardem really did a good job, showing how unpredictable menacing such men can be, by his body language & facial expression, even if his character's haircut is a bit goofy. Glad, he still won Best Supporting Actor at that year's Oscars. As for the other performers, they were just as good, especially Tommy Lee Jones. The delivering of his character's dreams really does hold some emotional weight. It's here, we get hints what the title of the film taken from the opening line of 20th-century Irish poet William Butler Yeats' poem ""Sailing to Byzantium"", means, as he felt really defeated by the harsh ambiguity of this new time and mourns of the loss of the bygone era of decently, even if this ideal world might probably never even existed but has been an illusion, all along. While, this pessimistic somewhat preachy, yet violent ambiguous ending might turn off some viewer from rewatching this movie. I do have to say, the film is worth seeing, regardless. The cinematography alone is amazing. Some of the shots of the West Texas desert is beautiful to look at. Cinematographer, Roger Deakins did a hell of a job, setting up the camera & scenes. However, I wish, the movie had more of a score by composer, Carter Burwell to go with. For me, the minimized of the score leaving large sections devoid of music was a mixed bag. Some parts, the suffocating silence, kinda works like the gas station stop; in other moments, it undermined some of the gripping gory action sequences like the chase scene involving the Pitbulls. Nevertheless, overall heads or tails: the film still fire on nearly all cylinders. This is one motion picture worth checking out. It is a must watch.","

"diac228","4 December 2008","No Country For Old Men is an amazing thriller full of tension, suspense, well-directed moments, fantastic imagery, wonderful dialogue, superb acting, and a nice plot to tie it in together. Then the movie decides to end. This film takes one of the biggest quality downfalls I have ever seen in my life, and this is by no means exaggeration. How does a movie do so well for so long and then deliver such utter garbage when we the viewer least needed it? How on earth does a movie full of tension for so long suck out the entertainment and desire to continue watching in a mere matter of moments? The questions continue to linger through my head as I write this; as the Best Picture Oscar winner disappointed me in ways I've never been disappointed before.The worst part is the hard-hitting potential that was chugging along the fantastic story four-fifths of the way. The Coen Brothers looked like they ran out of ideas or just had no clue how to stop rolling the cameras and finish the gosh-darn story. In a film that liked showing more than telling throughout the first 90 minutes, it was certainly a surprise when the rest of the film was pretty much just narrated to us, as if we were a bunch of idiots. Main characters in the end are whether watered-down, having a serious case of the talkies, or just flat-out disappeared. This is easily one of the weakest films to actually receive a Best Picture nod. Well, at least it ain't Crash but it's certainly a movie that could have been one of the best in decades.In this film, we follow a hunter (Josh Brolin) becoming hunted down by Mexican criminals, lawmen (Woody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones), and a psychotic killer (Javier Bardem) because of a great deal of money he discovered at a crime scene. This is pretty much a tense, violent cat-and-mouse game that has a good deal of followers and supporting players. No Country For Old Men is based off a novel with the same name by Cormac McCarthy; and translates well to the screen with very few changes and subtractions. The Coen Brothers can weave a good script, and their previous work is definite proof of this (Fargo, come on now). The dialogue of the killer Anton was downright scary, and the philosophical views of the cops involved also spark a bit of interest. However, when staying close to the original material, one tends to forget that original material does have its flaws as well. Unfortunately, the Coen Brothers were also very accurate with the weak portions in the book.The ensemble cast in the film is absolutely wonderful, from the usually awesome Tommy Lee Jones to the decent Josh Brolin to the incredibly scary Javier Bardem. The film has a heavy dosage of cruel realism and the acting is one of the main reasons why this film worked so well for so long. Bardem portrays one of the best movie villains in ages, even surpassing that of Heath Ledger's Joker and Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith. His performance overpowers that of everyone else's by leagues.Let's discuss what made this film so magnificent for the first two acts. First off, the directing was phenomenal as there were many series of long shots that built up the tension to a point in which you couldn't breathe. Then there's the incredible cinematography that could craft beauty out of dull settings. Last but not least was the quick pacing that kept the story flowing well and maintaining the interest of the viewer involved. While the portrayals of the characters could have used some major work writing-wise (the origins of almost all the main characters were pretty much non-existent) they kept the movie interesting. The lack of a soundtrack allowed for us to truly appreciate the incredible usage of sound involved (even a wrapper made a distinctively realistic noise when placed on a table).Ending. What ending? The film literally wraps up in the middle of a scene. The film literally has no major climax, doesn't wrap up any loose ends, goes on a philosophical tangent, creates even more questions (which is never good if you are trying to END the movie) than answers. Everything going for this powerhouse flick was thrown away towards the end and instead we get this muddled, disgusting affair of dialogue. First 100 or so minutes: a lot of bark and bite. The last 20 minutes: weak, weak, weak barking and not a single bite. It was as if we were seeing two totally different movies, and neither one of them technically ended. It was as if the last pages of a good book were replaced with unsatisfying and useless Chicken Soup for the Soul quotations. The movie could have ended worse only if it were done in a gigantic musical interlude with hyper fruits flying out of cannons. Other than that random suggestion, you have to dig pretty hard to find the last time a good movie that ended in such a sour note.Bottom Line: beautiful gem in the beginning, utter trash and garbage by the end of it all. What hurts the most is that with so much potential, the Coen Brothers ripped apart what made the movie work and spiraled it towards heavy disappointment level. The sour taste of the ending still lingers in my mouth as I write this. Best Picture? Sorry, but the entire movie has to deserve it, not just most of it. It's a total shame because there was such good usage of sound, such good cinematography, and grand acting. No Country For Old Men was like a five-star meal with a two-star topping. Let me end the review just like the mov-","

"daoldiges","26 October 2022","Bardem, Brolin, and Jones all give solid performances and are able to craft together interesting characters. Most of the supporting cast also does a fine job throughout this kind of chase story. The visuals offer some captivating images and there isn't an over abundance of dialogue but plenty of suspense, observation, and mood to keep the proceedings interesting. There is an ample amount of violence and bloodshed in No Country for Old Men, which I guess could be justified by the story, but at the same time not really necessary. That's a directorial decision the director's made and I'm fine with that. No Country for Old Men is worth checking out.","

"matthewpr06","6 February 2008","I've seen this film twice now and although I enjoyed and appreciated it the first time around, I was less forgiving about it after a second viewing. I personally think the Coen Brothers are brilliant filmmakers but No Country just doesn't work for me. First thing that bugs me is the folly of the films supposed primary theme; chance. Seriously, all the coin flipping is so blatant and un-subtle that surely it can't be what the film is about, can it? I've always found the Coen's work to be very refined, so to be bashed over the head with something so clichéd as a-man-flipping-a-coin-to-represent-chance just doesn't seem quite right for me.Obviously, No Country isn't a bad film. Technically it's brilliant, in terms of cinematography; shot selection, lighting and framing everything on screen is impeccably done. Also, the acting is superb; Bardem's Chigurh is instantly iconic. Brolin's LIewelyn (surely a name that should be used more in movies) is strong but vulnerable, unapologetically simple, yet layered. Equally, Tommy Lee Jones's Ed Tom is an interesting and enigmatic character. However therein is one of the main problems I have with this film; the Ed Tom story thread just doesn't fit in this film; thematically and tonally it's at odds with the main story and all it does is succeed in giving the film a bloated feel. For me, it's a case of a good performance that has been added to the detriment of the rest of the film.So what is No Country For Old Men about? It can't be about chance as that is too obvious. It can't be about getting old because it has so little to say. Is it about the insignificance of man off-set against the indeterminably powerful presence of nature and the relentless passage of time? Perhaps, but the Coen's have never been complex and pretentious just for the sake of being complex and pretentious.I can appreciate the fact that No Country is a good film, well made with some great composite elements. However I don't feel it has the vibrancy of O Brother, Where Art Thou?, or the humour of Fargo, or the intelligence of Barton Fink. For me, this film is an un-satisfying mix of art house film-making and mainstream marketing, which benefits from great performances and an interesting central story but is damaged by poor choices in terms of muddled themes, sound design and the inclusion of an unnecessary sub-plot in what otherwise would have been a brilliant film.","

"paddy-2","29 January 2008","I deliberately avoided reading any reviews or seeing any clips of this film before seeing it, thinking that it would be nice to come to it completely fresh. I generally like a lot of what the Coen brothers do - Hudsucker Proxy and Fargo in particular. But I hated Miller's Crossing, and that should have warned me.No Country got off to a bad start, in that the initial voice-over was almost completely incomprehensible to me. OK, I'm English, and maybe I find a deep Texan drawl as hard to understand as someone from Texas might find Glaswegian, but this just put me in a bad mood. If you've got a character who's got to impart some information, then please get him to open his damn mouth while he talks. Through the whole movie, people talked to each other in this glutinous mutter, and I just sat there rolling my eyes. CAN'T HEAR YOU! Fargo had people talking ""funny"", but at least you could understand what they were saying. So yes, maybe I missed some vital information.As for the movie as a whole, well, there were good things - the landscapes, the photography, some neat protagonists, some good tense situations. I liked the lack of music, and the slow pace. But at the end of it all, it all added up to very little. A bunch of americana clichés - motel room, garage-owner, people driving around in cars, mute banal violence, sweet white-trash wife in a trailer, yeah yeah, seen it all before. It all started to feel like a mix and match style exercise.I don't mind a bit existential alienation - Two Lane Blacktop and most of the films of Tarkovsky are among my personal favourites. But there was something pointless about this film. Terminator-style remorseless killer chases opportunist around, and lots of people die. Um. Old cop sees lots of dead people and gets a bit depressed, but is too lazy or stupid or filled with ennui to do much about it. Bad people wander out of the picture. The End.Actually, the end was simply dreadful. I don't mind a sudden, strange, open ending. If the film ends like that, and the audience rocks back in their seats and you hear a massed intake of breath - well, that's one thing. But with the end of this movie I could sense a collective thought... ""Is that IT?!""","

"ScottBang","21 November 2007","I really really hate this film and I'm flabbergasted at the amount of alleged love for it. I still refuse to believe that some of these positive reviews here are legitimate. Still, maybe my expectations were skewed going in to it. I was expecting a ""Walking Tall"" meets ""Fargo"" movie, a quirky and intense tough guy crime drama that would leave me satisfied. This movie and especially its resolution are the least satisfying in recent memory.I've read the elitist argument about deeper themes and beautiful cinematography but without a story to pull it all together, who cares? To me, a movie is primarily about character and story. Even great performances and direction can't save a bad concept or story. This story is ugly on paper and it's despicable on screen. Some of the spoilers have been disgusted here so, there's no need to rehash them. Needless to say, killing characters may haunt and disturb the viewer but it's cheap emotion that normal movie goers will resent. The piecemeal dialogue is also off putting. Every exchange seems to be a poor parody tribute to Pulp Fiction style of dialog. Tommy Lee Jones' character being the worst ""witty"" offender.I guarantee you that word of mouth from average movie goers will be quite poor for this trash. The only good thing is that after, people will feel truly betrayed by the critical consensuses and praise for it. This will farther erode trust in opinions of the critics. Making critics even more useless is never a bad thing. When I see the TV commercials for Old Country and the quotes they use, I resent every word and every critic mentioned. After others waste time and effort with this movie, I won't be the only resentful one.Terrible, terrible movie.","

"hbdrums-1","25 February 2008","Brilliantly shot? Yes. Brilliantly acted? Yes. A masterpiece? Emphatically not. As an accurate cinematic realisation of a book the Cohen brothers' version of Cormack McCarthy's novel is hard to fault. But the novel is ludicrous, and, ultimately, so is the film.Why? Because:1) The self-consciously post-modern comic book plot: a briefcase of drugs money, temporarily unguarded after a desert drug-deal shoot-out in which everyone died, is found by 'Nam vet (Llewellyn Moss - Josh Brolin) while hunting deer. Living gang members are quickly on his trail. Moss goes on the run with the cash. Terminator-style hit-man (Anton Chigurh - Javier Bardem) embarks on killing spree to recover the loot. He starts by brutally throttling a policeman. Ordinarily this would trigger a massive police response. But this never happens. Instead, two local lawmen trail lamely in Chigurh's wake as the killings multiply, casually and repeatedly messing up abundant forensic evidence as they go. Eventually Chigurh recovers the cash, kills Moss and probably Moss's girlfriend too (just to keep a promise). Ageing sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) laments tide of violent crime lapping at his feet. The End. 2) Apart from the burnt-out Bell, the characters are about as realistic as the puppets in an episode of Thunderbirds. They move through the plot in the same jerky way with strings glinting in the unrelenting Texan sunlight. The hit-man is the most clunky puppet of the lot: a relentessly banal robot. The adulation heaped on this silly film is a classic example of the emperor's new clothes.","

"MichaelMargetis","23 November 2007","Anton Chigurh: What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss.Goddamn! The Coen Brothers are back and in full form. It seems as though 'No Country For Old Men' is the film to beat this year for the coveted Best Picture Oscar prize. Although it was a different film than I expected, it's every bit as powerful, tense, awkwardly funny and relevant as I had hoped, perhaps even more so. Based on Cormac McCarthy's critically acclaimed novel of the same name, 'No Country For Old Men' is a deeply symbolic and straight-forward story of the struggle between good and evil. The film opens with a flawlessly delivered monologue by the ever-so-great Tommy Lee Jones who portrays Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. Bell is a small-town sheriff in the state of Texas, and in his monologue he talks about how hardened and ruthless we've become as a society. ""The crimes we see today...it's hard to even take it's measure. It's just all out war."" mutters Bell. This monologue is the perfect setting for Llewyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who while hunting antelope in the desert stumbles upon half a dozen dead Mexicans, heroin and $2.4 Million. Being the road scholar he is, Moss figures no one will come looking for the moo-la if he snatches it. WRONG! Not only does the Mexican mafia and reputable bounty hunter / smart-ass Carson Welles (Woody Harrelson) pursue Moss, but also one of the most twisted, unpredictable and unreasonable villains in recent film history. His name is Anton Chirguh (Javier Bardem), and when he's not blowing innocent civilians' heads off with a cattle gun or flipping a coin to determine whether you live or die, he quietly observes everybody and everything around him.'No Country For Old Men' is a triumph in film-making in that the film has no real flaws. Critics might pan it as ""slow-moving"" but that's essential in order to correctly build the tension for the key scenes. Most of the film is actually quite fast-paced with such nerve-wracking sequences it will have you on the edge of your seat with a knot in your stomach for a majority of it's runtime. But 'No Country's' quiet and subtle scenes are every bit as powerful as it's action-packed and suspenseful ones. This is due in large part to the screenplay. Supposedly following very closely to McCormac's novel, the Coen brothers deliver their finest work EVER from a screen writing perspective. Yes, it's even better than 'Fargo'. As for the Coen's directing and editing, it has never been smoother. The film's transitions are nothing short of breathtaking.From an acting stand-point 'No Country For Old Men' is also incredible. The stand-out of the film is of course Javier Bardem as the ruthless homicidal maniac Chirguh. Just his facial expressions and body language is enough to make your skin crawl, and if that's not enough, he delivers every line including his catch-phrase ""friend-O"" with such brooding intensity and creepiness it makes you want to sink in your seat. Bardem is a lock for a Best Supporting Actor nomination this Oscar season, but his biggest competition is the two other key performances of the film. Josh Brolin who last week impressed me with his malicious turn in 'American Gangster' as a crooked cop, is the best he's ever been here in the role of Moss. Moss is such an unlikely hero in the sense he is kind of dumb, not very nice, makes stupid decisions and yet we still root for him to escape the drudges of the Mexican mafia and even worse, the wrath of Chirguh. Tommy Lee Jones I'd say is Bardem's biggest competition. With this and 'In the Valley of Elah', Jones has proved this year with these two performances that if anything he's getting better with age. Jones' monologues are flawlessly delivered like I previously stated, including his final one which left me with goose bumps at the end of the picture. Woody Harrelson is humorous in his limited role as a sharp-witted and over-confident bounty hunter, and Scottish actress Kelly MacDonald is phenomenal in her role as Moss' butter-brain wife. The film has a numerous amount of strong small performances including Garret Dillahunt as Bell's Deputy, Tess Harper as Bell's wife and the 'Office Space' stapler guy (Stephen Root), in a well-played dramatic role as a crime boss. Roger Deakins outdoes himself yet again with some awesome cinematography, and while quiet and subtle, the film's music score is haunting.There is no other film this year that I can recommend as highly as 'No Country For Old Men'. There are times when it has you on the edge of your seat in suspense, there are times when it has you laughing violently at some of the darkly humorous scenes and through-out the entire 121 minutes it has you using your brain. There's a lot of symbolism and powerful metaphors in the film, but since I'm not writing a 5-page essay, I'll let you figure them out for yourself. With 'No Country For Old Men' the Coen Brothers have once again raised the bar on how outstanding and thought-provoking a simple crime-drama can be. Grade: A","

"Supermanofsteel","2 January 2008","This was a terrible movie. It had no cohesion or direction. It was a scattered mess. Just as you got to know a charter they would be removed from the film.One of the biggest disappointments was how they ended the story line between Josh and Javier's charters. They have this great story unfolding then bam, it's over. And to make it worse they don't even show you what happens. All you see is the sheriff pull up and Josh's charter is dead.Why put Woody's charter in the film if all your going to do is kill him in 2 or 3 scenes in a meaningless manner? His whole charter made no sense. At first you suspect he is some quick thinking hired gun to help clean up the situation. Next thing you know he is dead and before he dies he almost has a nervous breakdown. That charter alone was so contradicting of it's self it was pathetic.These directors need to find better ways to tell the movie's story line instead of finding a story that they can use to showcase their style of film making.","

"petersj-2","28 May 2008","There is nothing wrong with the acting in this movie. Indeed all the performers give strong characterisations. Visually at times it is splendid and the small cameo performances such as the two kids on their bikes fascinated with the guy's bone sticking out of his arm and handing him a shirt he uses as a sling. Scenes of an injured dog on the plains are heart breaking. There are some gruesome scenes unbearable to watch but that rarely worries me. I do think it becomes over done though. Shock and shlock! But in the end its a very over rated empty vessel. It is totally confusing, convoluted and incoherent. Either the film is badly edited and we end usp with a disconnected mess or the directors are trying to be too clever for their boots. Obviously audiences liked it but for this movie goer it was very unsatisfying and hardly worthy of an Oscar. Still if the Academy can over look a masterpieve like Broke Back Mountain and give it to a dud like Crash, what can one expect?. Another woeful unsatisfying move by two over rated movie makers. A cop out ending.","

"coldwaterpdh","2 September 2008","""No Country for Old Men"" is very overrated and I think to argue that would be silly. For those of us who have admired the Coens for years, this is standard, if not a little less-than-good, fare.The characters are thin and not convincing, (aside from Bardem of course, who creeps out even the toughest among us with his callous and merciless, haunting demeanor,) unrealistic and pretentiously written. We are treated to the meaningless philosophical ramblings of a sheriff whom we are never given the chance to know, much less love. The main character is killed off in a manner which is unfair to the viewers; we don't even get to see it happen. It is emotionless and pointless. Throughout the film, we are bombarded with beautiful images of the American west, but unlike in the superior ""Raising Arizona,"" they prove to be nothing more than eye candy, for the story could have really taken place anywhere. And in any time for that matter. Which brings me to my next complaint: when does this story take place? Judging by the cars, clothing and style, I'm thinking early 80's? But it really doesn't matter.The story never goes anywhere, so much is left unexplained and it's nightmarishly vague. Sorry to say people, it just wasn't that good. I'll end this review like the film ends.Yet somehow, it is still better than most of the new stuff coming out and that is really sad. 6 out of 10, kids.","

"michray","16 December 2007","It is not often you see a movie so blatant about the ascendancy of evil over good. But this is one. In a way it is very well done, and in a way it is very hollow. If you think that people's deeper humanity is a weakness against evil and see this as a profound comment on life as we live it in the 21st century, then so be it.You can rate each character in the movie's chance of survival by how evil they are. Gradually the less evil are killed off by the greater evil and good sees itself as ""outmanned"". One by one they are done in until only the one greatest and most evil is left. The good sheriff survives by more or less giving up and retiring.After seeing this, I will boycott the Coen Brothers in the future. Extremely talented they are, but how can I condone such a profoundly evil movie--an immorality play.","

"anthonyjlangford","3 February 2010","There are some things you should know about Old Country for Old Men. It is based upon the book by Pulitzer Prize winner Cormac McCarthy. It is directed by the Coen Brothers. It stars Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem, (Sea Inside, Dancer Upstairs). It has been nominated for Best Picture for the Golden Globes and one would expect the same for the Oscars.Put simply, this is the Coen's best film since Fargo. This is a tense, uncomfortable film for all the right reasons, it's the effect most thrillers should but rarely offer. And yet there are subtle elements which lift it above the level of thriller which may leave fans of straight fare confused. To say more would be too revealing.Typically for the Coen brothers, it's very violent, but this only adds weight to Bardem's extraordinary performance, alone worth the admission price.The photography of the Southern American desert is graceful but spectacular and sits non intrusively alongside the narrative.'Rising' star Josh Brolin (Into the Blue, Goonies) is great to watch and you'll be pulling for him even though he's risking it all for the cash. Tommy Lee Jones plays Tommy Lee Jones in a role not too dissimilar, in feel at least, to his directorial Three Burials.There are other performances of note, including Woody Harrelson and Kelly McDonald (Trainspotting), but this is a showdown between Brolin and Bardem, with the Coens' hunching eagerly behind both. It's one of cinema's most enthralling battles.What else do you need to know? Zilch.(Review written at time of release).","

"FilmCriticLalitRao","31 March 2010","There are many viewers who tend to believe that Coen brothers enjoy making light,enjoyable thrillers which are easy to comprehend by all and sundry as their humane protagonists hover around seemingly tolerable lines of good and evil.However,this is not at all true about their latest film ""No Country for Old Men"" as they have made a brilliant film in which an apparent simple cat and mouse chase becomes a ticklish affair for everybody involved in it.This film is able to strike a pleasant chord in viewers' hearts and minds as Coen Brothers make people believe that they are going to see something extraordinary as this particular film's emotional as well as philosophical dimensions are almost matchless.It is sad to state but many a viewer might be tempted to comment that superb acting talent of great American actor Tommy Lee Jones is not properly utilized.He has been given an extremely odd role where he looks very old,tired and completely depleted of energy.One would also not fail to remark that as usual,Coen brothers have given actress Kelly MacDonald a secondary role which would enable her to join the list of weak women characters in their films.Fargo is the only exception to this rule as it featured an extremely strong woman character.After having watched ""No Country For Old Men"",film critic/Senior French translator/interpreter Lalit Rao joined that famous league of extraordinary cinema admirers who have all been part of a hallucinatory experience called cinema as nights have a very special meaning in ""No Country For Old Men"".","

"mgoldhamer","16 November 2007","Where would there be a country for no old men? Logan's Run? The 1960's science fiction film based on the book of the same name where the main plot of the story is to voluntarily commit suicide by the age of 21. This might seem more plausible in one's own personal world of dreams. Herein lies the main fault with the latest Coen Brothers big screen extravaganza: No Country for Old Men. The tract of the film seems more like a personal dream by the Coen's and not a film script. Many groups of flickering images are presented before the eyes of the audience but there is little final transion to an outcome. Llewelyn Moss (JossBrolin) is one of the films heroes, pursed by a very psychotic killer called Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Llewelyn has stumbled into a very large drug deal, gone bad at the tale end. He grabs the money, like so many other Coen Brother plots and the chase begins. Unforturatly the pursuit is more like a Tom & Jerry cartoon. We meet many other characters who get in the way of the scramble, and just like in those Saturday morning cartoons, they die. Did I forget to mention the over narration by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones)? Mr. Jones does very well, as he does in most of his efforts, because he has practiced his trade down to a fine art. Sheriff Ed is almost a re-creation of the role Mr. Jones played in Men in Black, and just as sarcastic. The Coen's undertaking is quite funny all the way to it's final flicker. Next time the Brother's Coen could use a bit more adhesive, less nightmare, and men of any age.","

"SilverDiamond1987","17 February 2010","There a lot of people who hate the movie, not just disliked, they hate! Look at reviews or visit the forums, you will see. Art house movies are unconventional generally, but for No Country for Old Men is not an art house film, but it is not a blockbuster too. It is both, I mean artistic and at the same time entertaining. I know that the people who hate it would not call it entertainment, because they were not entertained. Then, why haters hate this movie? Because it is not a crowd pleaser? Well, firstly, they say that the movie was very dull, very very slow paced. If you ask me, the time flies by, I did not get bored at all. I was hypnotized, mesmerized. By the way, do you know what is one of the most frustrating things about this movie for me? Some people say this is inferior in comparison with Fargo or Blood Simple. I watched both movies and I am really sorry, but I enjoyed both movies, both are must- see experiences, but they are, Fargo, Blood Simple were just good movies to me, no more than that. A critics says that cinema feeling in There will be Blood was more strong than No Country for Old Men. How funny, I liked There will be Blood very much, but think just the opposite. The cinema of Old Men is more powerful than There will be Blood. Old Men is pure cinema. Another critic says that I would not call the movie masterpiece, because ultimately, a man pursues another man, this is the story. Well, this was what I wanted anyway, but also this is just the surface. The directors don't use background music (unconventional), I loved that, but this is the second complaint as I see. It makes the movie dull according to the haters. It causes me hypnotized. Many people like noisy, fast movies, this is the fact, isn't it? but why? Was Casablanca noisy or fast? No. Then, is it a movie to be hated? As for Javier Bardem, his performance, acting is appreciated even by the haters, otherwise I would kill myself anyway. Joking aside, you will think that I exaggerate, but no, to me, his performance, acting is one of the best ones of all time and his character is one of the best villains so far too. What Day Lewis is in There will be Blood, Bardem is in No Country for Old Men. A superhuman performance. Just by one scene, it can be understood. In one of the most disturbing scenes, even if off screen, I mean his last visit, after that, in the car, look at his face! It tells a lot of things. The opening scene of the movie is one of the greatest opening scenes ever made! In terms of content, it is horrible, in terms of cinema, it is great. In this scene, Bardem is at one of the zeniths of his performance by the way. To watch this character, Anton Chigurh was very entertaining, very interesting, sometimes funny and sometimes evil, horrible. One of the reasons that I love the movie is this, I mean, The Brothers created a great character, to be more precise, they adapted the character in a perfectionist way from the novel. As for Chigurh's weapons, forbidding, horrible, weird, but also inventive. I knew Josh Brolin by this movie, I can't remember him in The Goonies, I watched it when I was a child but. Therefore, I liked the actor very much including his character. After that I watched him in American Gangster and he was great in that movie. In this movie, he is in Bardem's shadow, but still does a great job. He was an interesting character too. On average, how many favorite scenes you have in a movie? No Country for Old Men is an exception for me, because if I count my favorite scenes, it makes almost the whole movie. All the scenes Bardem appears are my favorites once. I will mention some of them. The scene that he tries to find the bag by the device, the scene that he carries out first aid to himself (this scene also tells somethings about the personality of the character, he is really a psychopath, he seems panicked, he cares about himself, his health very much), the scene that he makes a sudden attack to the hotel, again a horrible, but in terms of direction, a fresh, great scene. I had not been on pins and needles like that in another movie. There are several reasons for that. For example, Anton Chigurh is like T-1000 from The Terminator 2. In some moments, I said to myself that's it! or something like that in theater. Now do you understand why I love that? As for the sheriff (our bonus Tommy Lee Jones), the first sheriff character on screen who is unwilling to solve the cases, catch the bad guys (unconventional and brilliant) And, as the third complaint, a few unexpected twists that take place near the final. It might be unsatisfying, but it was realistic and shocking. Everything does not work out the way we expect it will.","

"ygodson","21 May 2008","After the Academy awards ceremony, I was eager to watch this movie and I expected great deal from NCFOM.Only after watching it,I realized that this movie is trash.I simply don't understand how this movie made into IMDb top 250.A few reasons for my hatred towards this movie are 1.Characters are not used properly.I was unable to understand what significance T.L.Jones had in this movie. 2.Ending was pathetic. 3.The Coen brother's touch was missing.After Fargo,Big Lebowsky,you expect a lot from them. 4.I was disappointed after Llewelyn Moss was shot dead like a dog. The only plus in this otherwise forgettable movie is Javier Bordem's acting.. For his sake, I give this undeserving movie:5/10","

"erikgloor","3 December 2007","What if the Terminator was real but this time took the form of an infallibly clever, spaced-out-looking Mexican cat hell bent on retrieving the $2 million he lost in a drug deal gone bad? In 'No Country for Old Men,' the Coen Brothers follow up the engaging meditation on evil depicted in their groundbreaking 1996 film, 'Fargo.' In a hyper-real bleak-scape of rural Texas circa 1980 we variously follow the adventures of parallel protagonists as they quest either for the lost loot, the whereabouts of the Mexican, or an escape from the latter with the former.Along the way we are treated most notably to heart-breaking murder scenes in which Javier Bardem's spaced-out Mexican, Anton Chigurh, slowly drains innocents of their dignity and then pitilessly snuffs out their lives in that winkingly ironic fashion so popular in modern American film-making. It's a real laugh-factory.Additionally, we get long-winded, mind-numbing soliloquies from Tommy Lee Jones's Sheriff Ed Tom Bell about very little having to do with the actual plot. These speeches might have had a home in a film that connected them to anything going on in the story, but they seem variously lost and smug in this picture.Gluing it all together is a dreary and nihilist sensibility that loses all authenticity in its attempt at super-authenticity, not to mention story-telling that too often forgets its audience.Granted, the violence is visceral, mostly consequential and each scene in which it occurs is effective. It's not let-you-off-the-hook A-Team violence. It's all frightening and real. But you know what? So's my tax bill -- what else ya' got? Just because you've larded it up with ultra-realistic violence does not mean you've made an important film. Fargo wasn't great because the violence was real, Fargo was great because everything else was, too. No matter his methods, anyone leaving a trail of bodies this long would have inspired a dragnet of epic proportions -- especially in Texas. And especially considering Chigurh's first victim was a policeman.And for the coup de grace, we land on an infuriating, art-film ending that will leave you wishing upon the Coen brothers the same kind of pitiless death they'd portrayed throughout. Granted, there's some poetic logic that comes into focus at the end, but be assured it will render cold, cold comfort.The Coen boys were clearly trying to make something more than your average thriller, but it comes off like a snuff film pretending to be a parable.This movie review by Erik Gloor","

"gavin6942","19 February 2008","A sheriff in West Texas stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong. He is left hunting an innocent man who has taken the money from the deal (two million dollars) and the hit-man who killed the dealers and is trying his best to kill the man with the money. Throw in gun fights, secret stashes and border-crossing and you've got yourself the Coen Brothers' best film in years.What makes this film great (aside from the gorgeous cinematography) is also what makes it confusing for many people. The film is a bait and switch: we think we are watching a film about shoot-outs and men trying to escape the law with the loot (the same as any other Western or gangster story out there). And, to some degree, we are. But more importantly we are being told a lesson about fate and chance: we can live or die in any instance, either because we are destined to do so or merely by chance. While it's not common to accept both possibilities, this film makes a convincing case.The Coen Brothers love having the ""unstoppable evil"" character. Take, for example, John Goodman in ""Barton Fink"". And they definitely deliver with the hit-man Chigurh (who also carries the burden of fate and chance with him). Many great scenes exist in this film, but one that stood out the most for me was early in the film when Chigurh confronts a gas station attendant. I don't know if even a knife could cut that tension. The suspense was strong, and I was literally on the edge of my seat (which happens to be a futon in this case).This film is tied with ""There Will Be Blood"" for most Oscar nominations in 2007 (and at the time of this writing has not yet been judged). The tally is eight, and I can't agree more with this. 2007 was a good year for films (I also loved ""Juno"") and this ranks as one of the best, if not the very best. Even if you don't ""get it"" (I didn't at first and maybe still don't fully), you'll like this movie. Tommy Lee Jones, playing a cop for the 100th time, has perfected it. And Josh Brolin comes hot off of ""Planet Terror"" to show us he's ready to be a headliner. Show him some support.","

"Boba_Fett1138","8 September 2008","This movie always has been compared a lot to ""Fargo"", not just because its from the same directors but also the story and just the movie as a whole show lots of similarities. To be honest, I wouldn't exactly say that this movie is like ""Fargo"" at all. I wish it would had been though, since that probably would had meant that I would had liked and enjoyed the movie much better.My main problem I had with this movie was that the story and foremost its storytelling got unnecessarily complicated at times. The movie has all the right ingredients in it to make a good and typical Coen brother's movie with but some of the ingredients are not present good enough and not mixed in well enough with all of the other ingredients. It doesn't make ""No Country for Old Men"" as tasty as I would had hoped and also expected. After all, this movie was the big winner of the 2008 80th Annual Academy Awards, where it won Oscar's for best movie and directing. It mainly lacks some witty and subtle comedy. Yes, ""No Country for Old Men"" does obviously still feature this all but the movie just gives you the feeling if it all had been a tad bit more comical and not as serious, the movie would had been a way better one.It's still a superior shot and made movie though from the obvious talented Coen Brothers. It foremost also really shows how acting can really make a movie. Coen brother movie characters are of course always something unusual and unforgettable and ""No Country for Old Men"" also truly features some unforgettable and unusual characters in it.Of course most memorable is Javier Bardem as a serial killer with some odd weapons as choice. He deserved his Oscar. He plays his character chilling, as well as with a sense of comedy, despite the fact that his character doesn't ever show some emotion. A real great achievement from Spanish born actor Javier Bardem. But the entire movie is basically well cast with some big names such as Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson in it, as well as some unexpected choices, such as Josh Brolin and Kelly Macdonald in some roles I had never ever seen them in before but they fit and play their roles surprisingly well.The movie is slowly build up with some long shots. It makes ""No Country for Old Men"" also a real beautiful movie to watch, also not in the least of course thanks to Roger Deakins Oscar nominated camera-work.I would say; beware not to expect another ""Fargo"" and you'll probably end up liking this movie but if it had been a bit more entertaining all it really truly would had been one of the movies of the year.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"JoeKarlosi","27 December 2008","I kept meaning to see this when it was in the theaters because I'd heard so many great things about it. When it was praised at the Academy Awards and even got a Best Picture Oscar, I tried a little harder, but bad scheduling kept interfering. Now that I've seen it (not once, but twice -- more on that later) I've come to think the man upstairs might have been trying to spare me several dollars. First off, with such expectations going in, this will have to rank as one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen. My **1/2 rating wouldn't have changed a bit had I never heard of its reputation; it's just that I wouldn't have used the term ""overrated"" to describe it.The Bad: I'll skip with the storyline here, but just say that there are some plot holes and bits of business that just never made much sense to me (like having the suitcase transferred through the vents in the different hotel rooms). None of its characters are likable (not that this in itself is a deal breaker if a movie works), the pacing is lethargic and sleep-inducing, and the ending is terrible and inconclusive. Tommy Lee Jones is interesting as an ineffective Texas sheriff who can't deal with the escalating new brand of random violence, yet he's underused. All he does is offer up endless musings about how things have changed, but one wonders why they'd give a badge to such a disinterested lawman. And not only is Jones not interested; does anyone else in this state ever hear or react to all the endless shootings, car explosions and crashes going on everywhere?The Good: nice direction and cinematography, and good performances from Jones, Josh Brolin, and -- of course -- Javier Bardem, who makes one of the screen's most memorable villains with his ominous portrayal of a crazed and indifferent psychopathic killer. That said, do I think Bardem's performance was worthy of the coveted Oscar which he received? No, I wouldn't go quite that far. But as of this time I haven't seen the other best supporting actors' work in the other films they were nominated for along with Bardem.In the end this is just an Above Average chase movie with elements of western, horror, slash-and-stalk, and melodrama. It's well-acted, shot nicely, benefits from not using any music score. But I'm not sure of the point to any of the ugliness that's going on, and some things were incomprehensible, including the unsatisfying conclusion. I actually made sure to watch it two times... first last night where its pacing made my head nod a few times... and then again bright-eyed and bushy-tailed the next morning, just to make sure I gave it a fair chance. My rating stayed the same both times. **1/2 out of ****","

"scribnerville","23 November 2007","The ""Incoherent Brothers"" can go straight to hell for foisting this pretentious, boring mess on us! And maybe they'll take the scores of fawning critics, some otherwise respectable (et tu, Peter Travers?), along with them.While I swore off All Things Coen many years ago (Fargo being their one, though naturally overrated, saving grace), I thought I'd give them another chance when I witnessed the flood of critical praise that followed the release of ""No Country for Old Men"", especially when this one was purported to be unlike anything the filmmakers had released to date. That's not entirely true, by the way. Style-wise, this film is really just a remake of Fargo, only more annoyingly executed.So what's the problem? For one thing, all the damnable Coen trademarks are here: cloyingly hip dialog unlike any you'll ever hear in real life; subtle, and not so, deeper meanings permeating the script, just daring you to ""not get it"" along with the unwashed masses of simple film-goers who appreciate movies with a beginning, a middle and an end (What, you don't get the in-jokes? What an A-hole you are!); a camera that lingers on characters for interminable lengths of time while they drone on and on; a smattering of pointless ancillary characters that advance the plot not one single bit, etc.Added to the mix is Tommy Lee Jones, as the stereotypical small town sheriff (How original!), playing the same Texas character he's tackled in any number of other movies, who does absolutely nothing but talk (and talk, and talk) his way through the film, spewing countless homespun aphorisms and stories about whogivesacrapall to his hapless deputy and anyone else who'll listen. Done to death years ago were the requisite interludes in films like these where a southern-fried character waxes poetic for several minutes at a time, offering the audience some symbolic words of wisdom designed to illuminate some plot point or other. But, as usual, nothing comes of it here, and the Coens do it to a fare thee well. (If I never hear another gratuitous redneck soliloquy in a movie, it will be too soon: ""My daddy once said..."" Oh, screw you!).Saved from sucking completely, the film can boast of a creepy villain, played with subtlety and style by Javier Bardem, who reminds me of an understated Raul Julia. His performance is guaranteed to stay with you long after the closing credits. One wishes more screen time had been devoted to his unsettling assassin.The greatest sin a filmmaker can commit is leaving the audience bored. The Coen brothers do that more than a few times throughout the course of this picture. Unnecessary attention is devoted to such details as an injured man dressing his wounds after a gun battle, and the aforementioned pointless monologues among characters, while the fate of the film's central character is decided off-camera, with a puzzling, and highly unsatisfying result for the audience.Then, to make matters worse, and perhaps showing that the director doesn't watch TV, anyone familiar with the obnoxious and controversial ending of a certain popular cable show last summer will recognize the unceremonious way in which this film ends, leaving the theater's audience scratching their heads at the screening I attended. Pissing off your audience: Always a bad idea! What a shame. This movie had some true potential. Despite the few gripping scenes, the film lets it all slip away and squanders whatever promise it might have had. No real entertainment value here.Maybe the Coens should join forces with the other siblings who have no business making movies--the Farrrelys and Wachowskis. Between the lot of them, perhaps a coherent script might emerge. They may need to start making movies separately, or pairing up with other people to see what fresh ideas might result from such a partnership.I do know this: I've sat through my last time-waster from these guys, and I'd consider returning only when they've created something other than the same tired retread of their past efforts. Vaya Con Dios, Joel and Ethan!",NA
"kairinsora","21 March 2008","I cannot believe this was rated so high, in the top 250, and won 4 Oscars! When I was watching the Osacrs and saw that this movie won best picture of the year, I wanted to watch it and see what was all the fuss about. I started watching it, and it was kind of slow.But I thought that's how all good movies start (some of them). Then when he found all those dead men and the money it was weird. But then when he went back after he got the money, that was just SOOOO stupid of him! Why did he go back?! Just take the money, run away with your girlfriend (if he wants) and get over it!

"AzimAzimzade","25 May 2022","I dont realized the whole film , even though I watched it several times and explaination of that. First of all Anton is the most dreadful villain that I have ever seen. I have watched so many films but never scared of character as much as scared of him. Sheriff realized that he is getting older and thats why story that happened in the film is example of his depressive thoughts. He thinks he is old man and doesnt understand modern crimes and violence. He always missed for crime. He only came when it is already late. On other hand Anton survived meant that Sheriff think he is old man and violence will be increased in the future. Because Anton symbolized his depressive thoughts , violence and crimes that he never understands.",NA
"eebmtl","20 November 2007","Saw it twice in one week and am happy I did as I not only appreciated it more the second time around, but also was able to clear up two confusing points.First the film, it's great! Starts with a bang and never let's up, very linear story that continues to drive straight ahead against the backdrop of the older law enforcement officers who are left behind by a world and it's morality, changing too fast for them.The narration, conversations between the older characters and Sheriff Bell's near monologue at the end, go a long way to explaining the backdrop against which this story is laid out.All the leads are at their best, especially TLJ. Javier B. and Josh B. are also outstanding, as are most of the supporting cast.For fans of the Coens, you will get the appropriate camera work ***minor spoiler alert***(when Anton sneaks up on the deputy hanging up the phone, ***end spoiler***as well as those moments when you laugh, but uneasily.I do want to comment on some confusion touched on in a few other comments made in this forum*********major spoiler alert********major spoiler alert********* Anton is NOT in the motel room when Bell returns to the scene of the crime (this after the conversation with the old local Sheriff and his comment on how bold Anton was to return to the Hotel, a crime scene, to make the second kill)it is Sheriff Bell in his own mind picturing the worst case scenario of Anton waiting for him, watch it again and you will get it (I only got it the second time)and yes Anton did get the money, this is clearly shown to us by the air duct grill lying on the floor along with the screws and the DIME which is what Anton was shown to use as a screwdriver through the whole movie.******end spoiler alert*********** The ending is quite fitting as after all there is ""No country for old men"", Bell's description of his second dream the night before go a long way to explaining that and setting up the ending.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did, for those expecting a Bruce Willis or other Hollywood type action/murder movie DO NOT go to see this film, you will find it long, boring, unsatisfying and with a stupid ending.Can't wait for ""Burn after reading""",NA
"sirdjb-1","18 June 2016","Now I've seen some harsh reviews, but I'll always stand by the notion that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Plus that's not to say that this film hasn't been received well critically. However, when people make assertions like 'this films overrated' without being able to substatantiate that opinion it frustrates me because it gives this film a bad rep without good cause.Now the reason I love this film is because it puts into practise that all too rare technique of showing, not telling. These days so much exposition and plot is just spoon fed to us in really haphazard and unnatural dialogue. In the first 10 minutes of this film you learn all you need to know about the two main characters with maybe two sentences? Not even dialogue. And more than that this film doesn't treat you like an ignoramus.The film uses a lot of metaphors and analogies - so a lot of people will call it artsy or pretentious but they brings me back to my disclaimer. It's just one of those subjective things.Another thing I like about this film is that it's very brooding or moody which for a thriller is great, you're constantly on edge. Javier Bardem as the antagonist is iconic. He's not your standard relentless murdering psychopath, he is a character with a code and morales. It is a complicated film, it tells a linear story but follows multiple story archs and the film is very quiet which many people don't like surprisingly. Some people might find the ending alienating. But ultimately the film ends on an important social comment about humanity, modern society, age and so much more. It's a very interpretive film hence why it has such a dichotomous reception. Anyway, I'm rambling now, it's late and I'm tired.Good day.",NA
"zordy","22 February 2008","We all are turned on when we watch ""graphic"" violence, aren't we? Blood on the walls, holes in the head, tough men darning their own wounds Rambo-like are graphic or not? Who knows. But here's another flick with the usual omnipotent killer going around America killing at will and finding out where his victims are thanks to a 6th sense or maybe a radio device that apparently beeps at 100 yards and still allows him to find the target in the immensity of Texas. Terminator had more verisimilitude. But who cares? You got the madman killing scores, and a couple of directors very good at creating suspense and at dropping cinematic stunts and unusual narrative tricks to make you wow! Maybe it is thanks to this will to be different (see, or better don't see, how the main character dies, for instance) that we don't have to stand the overused time overlaps in Tarantino's fashion or same-fact-from-different-point-of-view narrative like Inarritu docet. Instead, as pauses in the relish of this bloodbath, we are offered some pointless tirades by old men that are probably meant to be deep and worth a prize for screenplay.

"jnunes-1","20 November 2007","Let me say that I'm a Coen Brothers fan. Loved Fargo, Barton Fink, O Brother, Blood Simple. I enjoyed this movie for most of it, although to me it was a less successful film than Blood Simple which has a similar feel.The big problem is the final act. The main character dies and it isn't even shown and is barely implied. I was confused in the theater when I saw it because I didn't know what happened to the Josh Brolin character. When the movie ended, several people in the audience were mumbling about the movie ending the way it did - inconclusively. The killer also kills the guy's wife at the end, but they don't bother to show that either. The sheriff has the bad guy cornered at one point in a hotel room, and the guy mysteriously disappears through an air vent.The movie goes along and is setting up a confrontation between the two adversaries and instead of showing it, we get Tommy Lee Jones musing about life and how crazy the world has become. Then the killer wanders off at the end after a random car accident. The real problem is that you apparently need to read the book to know what happens in the film, which makes it an interesting failure in my mind.",NA
"tomimt","22 June 2009","From my opinion ""No Country for Old Men"" isn't the best Coen brothers film. But that is not to say, it's a bad film, far from it, I just didn't enjoy it as much as I did of ""Fargo"" or ""Big Lebowski"".The story starts, when a lone man Moss (Josh Brolin) is hunting in the desert. He happens to stumble upon a busted drug deal and he finds a satchel full of money which he decides to keep to himself. Little he knows, that a psychotic killer Anton Cigurh (Javier Bardem) is also after the money, while sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is trying to figure out crime, he no longer understands.No Country could have turned out to be yet another a typical action film, in which everything travels steady as a train towards anti-climatic ending, which can be guessed straight from the opening scene. This would be the case, if the movie would have been done anyone else, than the Coen's. They manage to do a story, that manages to be quite surprising, despite oh so familiar elements.All in all, No Country is a good, solid film. Personally, as I stated in the beginning, I didn't like it as much I did like of some of the earlier Coen movies, but I still can recommend it, if you like their movies, as it really is a solid piece of cinema.",NA
"texrangers31","1 February 2008","I have read FAQ's, reviews, and comment boards and I still don't understand the ending to this movie. With the majority of the plot still up in the air the movie literally stops. It just stops--in mid sentence. It was absolutely ridiculous. I still managed to give the movie a 5 out of 10 because up until that point the movie was pretty amazing. It was fast paced, and full of plot twists, and than it just ends. My thoughts were, ""Wow, that was amazing for the first hour and a half, but I don't pay $8 to go to the movies and make up my own ending to the movie"". I'm sure that mostly every review that you will read will say how amazing this movie is, and I certainly see where they are coming from. The ending just frustrated me so much that I failed to see its brilliance. I would offer this advice to you, read the book first. That way you may have some type of idea what's going on when the movie ends.",NA
"Howlin Wolf","10 February 2008","... Or alternatively, as the tagline puts it: ""No one gets away clean"". At the outset, each character is confident that they can outwit their adversaries and that their idealistic vision will ultimately prevail. What time comes to show them, however, is that life always holds all the aces, and that not one of them will emerge from their struggle with an ending that suits them in the long term. Even Chigurh, the one whom all his fellow humans fear throughout the runtime - seeming to carry as he does an aura of supernatural invulnerability - gets an implacable air of natural justice served upon him by receiving the scars of hard-fought struggle. It's an extremely fatalistic message delivered to us, emphasised by the barren and unforgiving landscape that is the arena for these happenings. Sooner or later, every mortal will find themselves accountable to a force beyond their comprehension.Javier Bardem becomes an utterly terrifying figure, despite never appearing to exert himself much, on screen. That's good acting, I guess, when you can distill your performance and still find it encompasses everything that is necessary. The other cast members are worthy of praise too, and the Coen brothers marshal each individual element at their disposal to deliver a full tale that seems note-perfect and quietly resonant. ""No Country for Old Men"" is a film that leaves its imprint felt for a long time after viewing, and will deservedly be hailed as one of the true masterpieces of 2007.",NA

Then the psychopath visits the dead man's wife, presumably kills her, then has an accident fractures his arm and walks away. Nothing is explained. WHy does the guy survive for almost entire movie just to die near the end? What happened to the money? WHy did the sheriff give up on catching the killer?

"Sweet_and_Lowdown77","19 November 2007","I am a huge Coen brothers fan, but have been disappointed in their most recent efforts. While NCFOM is a lot better than THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, INTOLERABLE CRUELTY and LADYKILLERS (not hard at all), this is not a great film.**** POSSIBLE SPOILER ****For 75% of it, you think you're watching a masterpiece. You forgive all the little things because the whole is so satisfying. Knockout performances from Brolin, Bardem, and Woody Harrelson. But, like the book, once Moss dies, the story limps to the end. The Coen's were very true to the book. Maybe too much so in some places and not others. I think Moss's back-story got lost and added to an underdeveloped hero (although, like I said, Brolin is awesome). Bardem gets the role of a lifetime. The best scene in the film might have been with Bardem and the Gas Station Attendant. Genius.But Once Brolin's character is gone (very unsatisfying death by the way - not seeing your hero die?) The film becomes Tommy Lee Jone's film and it just dies. The life goes out. Jones is his usual self, although you got the sense this wasn't hard for him to do.The film's cinematography is excellent. The acting is great (except for Kelly McDonald's Mom). The lack of music was genius.But as far as ""best Film of 2007""... Not even close. EASTERN PROMISES wins that one.",NA

I wonder if Miramax test marketed movies with different endings in different markets, and we got this asinine crap-for-ending down in NC? (not really, but that would explain a lot).This movie deserves less than a 5, but the first two thirds of the film were so good, and Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem so riveting, well, it wouldn't be fair. Woody Harrelson is unnecessary and miscast in this movie. But the real thumbed nose is Carla Jean's mother, played by an actress in an old lady wig and terrible southern accent. What an insult. And what a waste of what could have been a fantastic movie.",NA
"son_of_cheese_messiah","25 April 2011","This is a rare (perhaps unique) occasion when I can read all the 1-star and 10 star reviews and partially agree with both polarised camps. After my first viewing, I thought ""WTF?"" but the film haunted me afterwards which made me want to view it again. The images are powerful and the bleak message ""Life's no fair"" is far from the usual Hollywood stuff.The film is rich in intentional ambiguities such as repay various viewings. The scene in which Tom Lee Jones enters the cordoned off motel thinking that Chugar may be present, is a wonderful example of the power of film. On the other hand, there are occasions when the confusion is a result of an inadequate explanation, such as why Wells does not retrieve the money bag. Details like this matter.My other gripe with the movie is that it loses energy in the last twenty minutes. Perhaps this is a result of following the source novel. But films are not novels, they have a different dynamic. Some of the wordiest exchanges come in this part including the introduction of a new character in a scene which is strangely isolated from the rest of the film. But I have no problem in them in themselves, merely in their placement at this late stage in the film.Some feel cheated that the protagonist (or the character they imagine to be the protagonist) dies off-screen and unglamorously, not even at the hand of his enemy. But this arbitrariness is the theme of the film and thus a fitting end.This is a truly innovative and important film and one of the few Oscar winners which will stand up to future generations.",NA
