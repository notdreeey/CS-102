This thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to, but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won.""John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made  fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission, but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the ""dog"" is actually a shape-shifting alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims  in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural prison.""The Thing,"" the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic ""Alien"" (1979). Many comparisons have been made  the protagonists are stranded in a desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off one-by-one. However, ""The Thing""  for all practical purposes  came first.Based on the famous short story ""Who Goes There?"" by John W. Campbell, Jr. (writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The result was ""The Thing From Another World,"" an unarguable classic. But to be fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening (and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.
From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all time, ""The Thing""  by any standards  is unconventional Hollywood at its best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, ""The Thing"" performed poorly in theaters, and ""E.T.""  released the same year and featuring a much kinder alien  became the higher-grossing picture of the two (by far).In the long run, however, ""The Thing"" is superior in almost every conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th Anniversary Re-Release. ""The Thing,"" on the other hand, has gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics  it is one of the most famous non-famous movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career  from his amazing ""Assault on Precinct 13"" (1976) to the magnificent ""Halloween"" (1978) to the disappointing and silly ""Escape from L.A."" (1996), ""The Thing"" remains his very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never been honorary enough to land it a spot on most ""great movies"" lists, ""The Thing"" is still one of my favorite horror films, and  upon close inspection  masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is simultaneously unique and chilling  a genuine relief for film buffs who are tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is genuinely unpredictable.","

"ivo-cobra8","31 October 2015","A classic film. John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made - fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since its release. I'll put any of ""The Thing's"" old-school effects up against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I could see ""The Thing"" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend? Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the guy/gal next to you really real?""Trust is a tough thing to come by these days."" John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense, claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score from Ennio Morricone! Awesome!!! 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval","

"hitchcockthelegend","4 March 2008","John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold. Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a ""what is in the shadow"" sequence, the film is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and see what happens indeed. 10/10","

"preppy-3","6 December 2003","Remake of the classic 1951 ""The Thing From Another World"". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material--the novelette ""Who Goes There?"") and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding. There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off, heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material. I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful. You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with ""E.T."" and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be close to a facility to throw up!","

"Gafke","28 December 2003","This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened.

Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one; the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre. Don't miss it.","

"I_Ailurophile","19 December 2020","""The ultimate in alien terror,"" it says. It's not wrong. This is it. This is the greatest horror film ever made. John Carpenter's A-#1.Cinema is full of great creature designs, yet The Thing bests them all. Every incarnation we see of the creature, and all the practical effects and set pieces that bring it to life, are the best that the industry has to offer. The most realistic CGI will never compete.The paranoia and distrust in the outpost is palpable. Carpenter crafts a tangible atmosphere of desperation and suspicion, from the unassuming beginning to the classic, ambiguous end--one of my very favorite endings from any movie, ever.Composer extraordinaire Ennio Morricone lends his great skills with a minimalist, synth-driven score that adds immensely to the building unease. It very well complements the performances of the excellent ensemble cast that bring every feeling of terror and wariness to life. Kurt Russell once again shines as Carpenter's lead, MacReady, and Keith David is superb as the antagonistic Childs. It's easy to overlook other cast members with smaller roles and less time on screen--even the unmistakable Wilford Brimley--but have no doubt, they're all just as good, just as essential to the picture.Once again: not only is John Carpenter a master storyteller, a fantastic director generally, but his greatest skill is in slowly building the tension and suspense in his pictures until the explosive finale. He does it so well that it's impossible for the viewer not to experience the same misgivings, the same sense of horror, as the characters on-screen--not because you're watching it, but because you FEEL it just as deeply.It's violent, it's gory, and broadly it may not be for everyone. But this needs to be seen by anyone with the slightest interest in horror, or creature features, or with a keen interest in cinema history as a whole. Similar stories may be told, but there are no and will never be any imitators.","

The Thing
Directed by: John Carpenter, 1982
Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing  today a highly treasured cult favourite  one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and critics when it first came out in 1982.
Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide) had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office rampage. Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was prepared  moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.
It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained such a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks' version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story ""Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire cast.
It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.
This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film history.
Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper, compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.
A satisfying example of a movie that today  18 years after  looks downright muscular in its simplicity.
The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film, making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.
Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque special effects. Be warned  there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find them disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a crowd of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research facility) terrorized by an alien life form.
Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece, his own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every way.
The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it never barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of - DVD version).
Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at a human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not the point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror movie.
Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection, making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.","

"Stibbert","11 July 2005","Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this. Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known. In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!","

"PeachHamBeach","22 May 2008","The silly saying, ""You can't touch this"" surely applies here. With all the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee out of me when I was a pre-teen.THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest, ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread, isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling, freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day, they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants. It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished, but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few of the fine cast. This film is the reason why horror CAN be a great genre. It actually STILL scares me. The alien blood ""jumping"" out of the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes ME jump!!!Still the scariest of them all.","

"Leofwine_draca","12 November 2016","Although this film clearly got made due to the success of ALIEN, I actually find it the better of the two. I certainly consider it Carpenter's joint best, along with that one with the Michael Myers guy. This is a film based on John W. Campbell's story ""Who Goes There?"", which also inspired the 1951 flick THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD which saw James Arness as a killer carrot-man in the same setting. Carpenter is closer to the original story, as his menace is a gory shape shifting alien which consumes and imitates its prey – forget the T1000, he has nothing on this thing. The look of the creature is extremely disgusting and disturbing and hard to forget – imagine some Lovecraftian terror in the flesh, covered in blood and tentacles and other less describable body parts, and you're halfway there.The rest of the special effects are incredible; witness heads slide off bodies and turn into spiders, and the infamous and gut-wrenching kennel transformation which I had the misfortune to watch when I was but a boy. You can bet I had plenty of sleepless nights after watching that one. Plenty of blood, gore, and violence throughout make this one of the hardest of horrors. Yet despite all the effects, this is still a plot-driven movie with absolutely loads of suspense and tension – not to mention a near overwhelming paranoia throughout.There are many imaginative moments – the opening sequence, in which Norbert Weisser tries to kill a poor little doggie – to the excellent blood test scene, in which the guys are tied down whilst Russell tests their blood samples for the alien virus. Russell is subdued but great and as an ensemble, the rest of the guys are true to life and so believable, which makes it all the more horrific. Every outburst, crack-up or breakdown seems to be happening for real and we do learn to care about these very natural researchers trapped in the worst scenario imaginable. Add to this a spooky Morricone score and you have a super movie about which I can say no more – except that you watch it for yourself.","

"BandSAboutMovies","19 December 2020","This movie failed at the box office and nearly ruined the career of John Carpenter. Think of that as you watch it. But did it really fail? It made nearly $20 million on a $15 million budget, but audiences must have expected more. Studios certainly did.Was it because E.T. came out at the same time, as well as so many other science fiction and fantasy films? Did the recession make people not want to watch something so nihilistic? Did the sheer level of gore turn people off? Were people upset that he remade a film some considered a classic*?After one market research screening, Carpenter asked the audience what they thought. One answered, ""Well what happened in the very end? Which one was the Thing...?"" When Carpenter said that the answer was up to their imagination, the response was, ""Oh, God. I hate that.""How could audiences respond to a movie that did not spoon feed them any of the story beats? That doesn't have a single character to root for or get behind? That is influenced by Lovecraft - as our the other Apocalypse Trilogy installments Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness - in that ordinary people face off with supernatural horror that they are doomed to be destroyed by, which isn't really what mainstream America wants from a popcorn film?Yeah, it could be all of those things. Or perhaps, the world was not ready for it. But watching the end of this film, as everyone sits around wondering who has a disease that they can barely understand and know will eventually impact them, yeah. I think the world of 2020 is ready for it.I wonder what it's like to watch this movie when it screens every year at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. I bet it feels pretty real there, too.In an interview with the AV Club, Carpenter said, ""If The Thing had been a hit, my career would have been different. I wouldn't have had to make the choices that I made. But I needed a job. I'm not saying I hate the movies I did. I loved making Christine and Starman and Big Trouble in Little China, all those films. But my career would have been different.""As it was, Carpenter was reluctant to make the film** and nearly quit before it ever started filming. A lifelong fan of Howard Hawks***, he felt that his version of the story - both are based on Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell Jr. - was unbeatable. But as he re-read the original story - spurred on by co-producer Stuart Cohen - he saw how he could make a movie with a vision for his time, just as Hawks had thirty years ago.Beyond Carpenter, so many talents make this film work. Of course, there are the actors on screen, like Kurt Russell, Keith David, T.K. Carter, Wilfred Brimley, David Clennon and Richard Dysart. But there's also the astounding production design and storyboards from Man-Thing artist Mike Ploog and Mentor Huebner, which were so detailed that several of the shots from this look like carbon copies of their sketches. There's Dean Cundy working to make every shot look amazing - this is his first major studio movie with Carpenter. Want it to get even better? Sure, Carpenter could have done the score, but he got Ennio Morricone****. And finally, the Rob Bottin-lef effects team were pushed to the brink of exhaustion - Bottin was only 21 years old and ended up going to the hospital for exhaustion, double pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer after working for an entire year on the film, sleeping on set - but the work they created will never be duplicated and puts any CGI efforts to remake this film to shame. Carpenter thought that having someone in a suit - like Alien - cheapened the film. He wanted something more. Well, he got it. In the last battle with the Thing, fifty different artists are operating the monster.We're lucky that this movie exists. I saw it at the drive-in this year and it felt like it could have been made today. It was too imaginative, too nihilistic and too good for most people, even nearly forty years later.*One of the reviews that upset Carpenter the most came from the co-director of the original, Christian Nyby, said, ""If you want blood, go to the slaughterhouse. All in all, it's a terrific commercial for J&B Scotch.""**Originally, Universal was going with Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel as the team for this movie, but were unhappy with their take. John Landis was also considered, but the film was really greenlit when Alien was such a big deal in 1979.***How big of a fan is Carpenter? You can see scenes of The Thing from Another World during Halloween.****Morricone's score for this film was nominated for a Razzie, while his score for The Hateful Eight - which has some unused music from this film in it - won him his only Best Original Score Oscar.","

"The_Wood","20 April 2002","John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in films.","

It has just enough to gross me out while making me wonder if the person next to me is an alien.The idea that this movie was made in the early 80s and it took years to be reevaluated before being well received just tells you how ahead of his time Carpenter is. Kurt Russell is one of my favorite actors from the pre2000s and this is a good example of why.It's one of those special movies I can't get enough of. Every viewing feels like the first. I can't be the only one who feels the same amount of dread and uncertainty every time I watch it.","

"TheLittleSongbird","8 April 2011","The Thing is not only a brilliant remake(which I was not expecting after seeing abominations such as Psycho and The Wicker Man) but it is also a brilliant film that seamlessly blends horror and sci-fi amongst other things.The atmosphere is especially what makes the movie so good. To this day, very few other movies have shocked, haunted or unnerved me as much as The Thing. The scenery, sets and costumes are eye-popping and the effects are brilliantly designed and suitably grotesque without distracting too much.There is also Ennio Morricone's most haunting score, a cracking script and a deliberately slow-paced but compelling story that is quite ahead of its time. Not to mention wonderful direction and credible and well-written characters. The acting is equally great, in my mind Kurt Russell has never been better, likewise with Keith David and Wilford Brimley has brilliant delivery of the lines.All in all, a brilliant film and one essentials and its genre(s). 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"Xstal","12 September 2022","You're stationed at an isolated outpost in Antarctica when a helicopter arrives intent on shooting a dog it had been pursuing across the tundra. Things get out of hand and the occupants of the chopper have their ability to pursue curtailed, more permanently than they'd like. Not too long after this carnage it becomes apparent that the pursuing shooters had a pretty good reason for wanting to remove the dog from the land of the living as the dog turns out to have the same aspirations as its pursuers, albeit in various guises, transformations, metamorphoses and reconfigurations.While this was made in 1981 it remains to this day one of the greatest and most engaging pieces of horror movie making that has ever been created.","

Great cast and character interaction, and covers the whole gambit of genre's (sci-fi, action, horror, thriller, mystery). There are even a few comedy moments, and with it taking place in Antarctica, it could even be classified as an adventure. It is one of the most re-watchable movies ever made.","

"DavidSim240183","1 May 2008","In 1982, two films were released within weeks of each other that were both about aliens. Steven Spielberg's ET, and John Carpenter's The Thing. Of the two of them, ET was the one that won the hearts of people the world over, even though The Thing debuted first. Because people were so entranced with Spielberg's warm, fuzzy feelgood alien fable, they stayed away from The Thing in droves.Its not hard to see why. The two are diametrically opposed. One is an optimistic tale designed to warm the cockles of the still-beating heart. The other is a harsh, uncompromising film that paints alien life as something purely determined to destroy us. I guess audiences felt ET was a much cuter prospect than The Thing's tentacles and slime coated saliva!It's taken some time, but The Thing has gone on to win over a substantial cult audience. As it should. Because The Thing is that rare example of a superior remake. It takes all the best qualities of the 1951 classic, and reinvents them in startling and imaginative ways. Indeed Carpenter does his job so well he actually succeeds in making a film that is in every inch the equal of the genre's showrunner, Alien. And that's even rarer!Carpenter's film follows its source material more faithfully than The Thing From Another World did. It keeps the frigid wastes of Antarctica as a setting, because its the perfect backdrop when you're trying to establish a heightened sense of isolation. But although a bit thin on characterisation, the remake gets right inside the mindset of the actors, and amplifies the uncertainty and fear that slowly surrounds them.Frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell returns, hot off the success of Escape From New York, cast once again as one of Carpenter's perpetual anti-heroes. He plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot at an Antarctic research station (what they're researching is anyone's guess). The trouble begins when a Norwegian chopper from a nearby station flies over MacReady's, trying to gun down a Siberian Husky from the air.They end up dying for their troubles, and while the camp tries to solve the mystery of what happened, they take in the Husky and add it to their own. Except that this Husky, is not a Husky at all. But a shape-changing alien. The Norwegians discovered it frozen in the ice, and when they thawed it out, it massacred their crew. Capable of absorbing its victims at will, it can duplicate a living being right down to the smallest detail. Soon paranoia and suspicion works its way through the 12-man crew, until no-one is certain who is human and who is not.The Thing is one of John Carpenter's finest films. In fact I'm tempted to say its the best film he's ever made. Even surpassing classics like Halloween and Dark Star. The reason why I place The Thing at the top of Carpenter's list is that it feels like the last film of his that could truly be called a classic. All the others thereafter have felt like Carpenter was slumming it. Films that didn't flow with the cool sophistication and ragged intensity so prevalent in his earlier works.But The Thing had John Carpenter at the peak of his powers. Never has he generated suspense to such an unbearable degree. Not even in the ferocious Assault on Precinct 13. From the second the alien makes its presence known, Carpenter ratchets up the tension level relentlessly. And when he delivers his punches, they come with an agonising jolt.The film is a blend of pure atmospherics and visceral horror. An approach that can often seem at odds with one another, but in Carpenter's hands melds together beautifully. Bringing in Rob Bottin of The Howling fame, he lays to bear some of the most astonishing transformation effects you'll ever see in a horror film. Amorphous shapes. Half-formed human features starkly contrasted with gaping jaws, spider legs and fully flexible tentacles. Indeed the film's effects are so amazing and squirm-inducing, The Thing came under fire for being too realistic!That type of thinking misses the point entirely. It only shortchanges the film's values. And there are many. Carpenter only stages an effects setpiece when he needs to. Its in the film's quieter moments where he seems especially attuned to the story. The Thing is an often bewildering tale of shadows, whispers and implications. Characterisation has never been one of John Carpenter's strong suits, but it works to his advantage in The Thing. Because we hardly know anything about the cast, it only makes the present situation that much more confusing. We're never certain, from one moment to the next who is who. And because of this, The Thing holds up very well and maintains its mystery on subsequent viewings.A special mention should go to the excellent film score from Ennio Morricone. A pulsing thud thud every two seconds. It creates an eerie, spooky feeling that is very hard to shake. The whole film is a wonderful exercise in paranoid manipulation. The scene where they blood-test each other to see who's human is wound up with such dexterity by Carpenter, you may find yourself biting your nails without even realising.The Thing is a pure unadulterated classic. Even the ending leaves you with the vague suspicion that not everything is resolved. An underrated film, well worth the reappraisal it received. And so much better than ET!","

"SnoopyStyle","11 October 2014","It's the start of winter. An isolation group of scientists at the United States National Science Institute Station 4 in Antarctica is interrupted by a Norwegian helicopter buzzing around. The Norwegians are throwing charges and shooting at a dog. George Bennings (Peter Maloney) is shot and Garry (Donald Moffat) kills the supposed mad Norwegian. Clark (Richard Masur) takes the dog in. MacReady (Kurt Russell) flies Dr. Blair (Wilford Brimley) and Garry to the Norwegian camp. They discover it smoldering and a place of massacre. Windows can't reach anybody on the radio.The makeup special effect is gruesome and astonishing. The pre-CGI real effect reaches an all-new high. The snowy atmosphere is stark. No room is given to sentimentality. Director John Carpenter has crafted an incredible masterpiece that is a must-watch for all horror fans. He brings out his music sound effects once again. The testing scene raises the tension beyond high. It's one of the most intense scenes in any horror.","

"Hitchcoc","10 March 2017","I don't know if I could ever watch this film again. It's one of those where, once you get involved, you sit on the edge of your seat, feeling everything that befalls these poor men. If one wanted to create a hell on earth, this would be it. From the Norwegians chasing that dog, to a minute by minute effort to survive and save civilization from this horror. The special effects dealing with the aliens transformation are stunning, especially when one realizes it was 1982 and the CGI stuff was really barely a thought. We care about the characters but are not let in on anything, so when something jumps, we jump with it. If there is a criticism, there is no release from the tension. Even if one is able to relax for a minute or two, there is an atmosphere of threat over everyone. When you can't trust the person you've known much of your life, who works next to you, when he becomes a deadly beast, what can you do? This is one of the greatest horror films ever.","

"Red-Barracuda","29 December 2012","A dog is chased through the wide open snowy expanse of the Antarctic by men in a helicopter who attempt to kill it with a rifle. They fail and die, and the dog enters an American compound unharmed. The men of this outpost now try to discover what events led to this bizarre sceneJohn Carpenter's remake of the 1950 Howard Hawks original The Thing From Another World is a definite example of a remake that exceeds the original. With this film Carpenter upgraded the original with excellent use of very impressive practical special effects. These effects still look extremely good today thirty years on. But it's not just this that has been improved; the characters and dialogue are better, while the sense of paranoid mystery is an entirely new addition to the story. Despite all these aspects, it comes as a surprise to a lot of people that The Thing was a box office failure upon release in 1982. Even the fools at the Razzies jumped on the bandwagon and nominated Ennio Morricone's Carpenteresque soundtrack for 'worst musical score' – a frankly ludicrous decision. Anyway, it was only in the years that followed that The Thing built up a reputation as a cult favourite, to the point that it is now considered something of a classic. Which is the way it should be considering that this is a highly effective and claustrophobic sci-fi horror movie.","

"ChadKuhns","5 August 2002","Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI, blue screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is. I have long since been a fan of John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In 'The Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but only like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an alien lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact with, and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into manic paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one second do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any genre for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it will leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a man thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that has driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is a truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what would you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature waiting to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition it deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.
If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat inducing, gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.
Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye","

"desotowright","3 May 2008","A group of explorers in the arctic region have encountered a vicious alien organism that can consume a person and make itself a perfect copy. This is a classic horror film that is loaded with brilliant special effects and graphic violence that is a perfect way to spend a cold evening. Kurt Russel stars as a troubled alcoholic who takes charge and tries to find which person is really the alien creature. One of the most brilliant things about the movie is that it plays with the idea of not knowing who you can trust. I found it interesting that it had an all male cast, something uncommon for many movies. The acting is very natural and very realistic. This movie was surprisingly scary and the graphic scenes were surprisingly horrific. It's a dark, brutal, and claustrophobic sci-fi horror film that has stood the test of time from the genius of John Carpenter.","

"Quinoa1984","31 December 2005","In following the lines of the classic formula to a point of taking another leap off from the material, The Thing remake becomes one of the coolest remakes of its time. John Carpenter fashions out of what must've been a fairly vague screenplay about certain things (or maybe very descriptive who knows), bringing forth incredibly wretched, brilliant puppetry and animatronics by Rob Bartin (with Stan Winston also on the team). These effects help set the tone against the harsh, detached environment Carpenter sets up with his characters. The film takes the story of a group stationed in a research bunker in the middle of an arctic climate, pitted against a malevolent force that takes the shapes of others. It's given a full life by Carpenter's choice of tones, and surprises. For someone following in the footsteps of Howard Hawks, the filmmaker here has a lot more trust and talent in executing the material than most given the chance to have another go with an old film.With the effects people working to full force- amid what would likely follow Backdraft as containing the most fire per scene (it could become overkill, but it all fits into the suspense after a while)- the actors pull along as a fine ensemble. Unlike the squad in Predator, these are mostly just regular working guys, with the leader coming in the from of Kurt Russell's MacCreedy (very good role for his style, excellent in fact). Juicy supporting roles are out for grabs for the likes of Wilford Brimley and Keith David. And it is refreshing to see how the sort of absurdity of what's going on in the film (an alien that starts off with dogs and then moves onto the others in gory, demented transforming form) is pit against such a tone of timing with everyone. I loved the long silences at times, with Ennio Morricone's spooky, curious music in the background (and that bass line is of merit in itself).It ranks up with being, if nothing else, delivering what it strives for for its genre/cult audience. It remains one of Carpenter's best; a rare breed of horror film where the story is told clear and precisely by way of the position of the camera, dialog, and timing with the scenes. That's not to say the film isn't chock full of violence, it is, and in fact a couple of times it's almost funny. But given that it goes back to what is ridiculously seeming like a by-gone era, the creatures/make-up, alongside the steady, well-calculated script, was done completely without CGI. It's disgusting, but it's real, and atmospheric to a T.","

"YellowTea","28 May 2021","I remember being encouraged to watch this in my mid-teens. Naturally, being a teen, I was reluctant to give anything from the 80s a try as I felt it to be a long gone ancient era. I was pleasantly surprised. The practical effects were a very welcome change to the cgi I was used to. They were done so well that I was at no point removed from the illusion. To this day, they're still the best I've seen. It's proof that if done right, practical effects such as animatronics will always beat out cgi.The movie is fantastic in every way. Kurt Russell is such a good actor that I'd have to class him as one of my favorites. Carpenter and Russell were a tour de force in the 80s creating both The Thing, and Escape From New York.","

"Vartiainen","29 December 2013","The movie opens to a frozen wasteland of Antarctica, as we spot the lonely figure of a dog fleeing from its pursuers. It's a bleak, unforgiving setting and a perfect opener to this movie. The Thing, based on John W. Campbell Jr.'s novella Who Goes There? is one of the finest horror movies ever made. In a way it reminds me a lot of Alien, another masterpiece of horror. They both have an isolated setting where no help will be forthcoming, they both feature an attack by an unknown alien entity and they both have unbelievably good special effects, the sheer brutality, goriness and impossibility of which are the stuff of nightmares.The Thing adds the fact that its alien is capable of assuming other shapes, and the movie evolves to a tense hide and seek game and as the pressure rises, the group of scientists and researchers starts to crack. It's an intense experience with long scenes of unbearable atmosphere followed by short bursts of soul-chilling terror facilitated by the special effects of one Rob Bottin, a master of his craft.It's a well-told story, ending on a perfect note that isn't too uplifting, but neither is it a complete downer. Easily one of the best endings to a horror film I've ever seen and the rest of the story is told equally as well. Perhaps my only nitpick is that some of the characters and their actors aren't as strong as, say, in the Alien. There's perhaps one or two too many for all of them to get enough screen time to really shine. On the other hand, some are really good, like Kurt Russell's MacReady or Wilford Brimley's Dr. Blair.This is a movie that every fan of horror owes to himself or herself to see at least once. Its special effects are so scary that I actually wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's prone to nightmares. They're not nice to look at, they're not pleasant and under no circumstances should any child ever see this film. It's that frightening, that good at what it does.","

"grantss","23 July 2016","A US research station, Antarctica, early-winter 1982. The base is suddenly buzzed and attacked by a helicopter from the nearby Norwegian research station. They appeared to be trying to kill one of the dogs from the US base. Having dealt with the threat, the members of the US team fly to the Norwegian base, only to discover them all dead or missing. They do find the remains of a strange creature the Norwegians burned. The Americans take it to their base and deduce that it an alien life form. After a while it is apparent that the alien can take over and assimilate into other life forms, including humans, and can spread like a virus. This means that anyone at the base could be inhabited by The Thing, and tensions escalate.A horror classic. A well crafted story, directed by horror legend John Carpenter. He builds the plot well, meticulously setting the scene and ramping up the tension with good effect. The period where anyone could be infected / inhabited is particularly suspenseful. Excellent special effects, especially for 1982. Very gory, imaginative and realistic. Some of the images from the movie are quite iconic and will be familiar from pop culture, they've been reused so much.Ending is maybe a bit too ambiguous for my liking. While I don't generally like neat, happy Hollywood endings, this possibly went too much in the opposite direction. A greater degree of closure, or at least an indication of where the story was heading, was in order, I think.Solid performances all round. Kurt Russell is particularly good in the lead role, playing the quick-thinking action hero very well.","

"Nightman85","14 January 2006","Another well-loved horror masterpiece from director John Carpenter is this unforgettable re-imagining of the 1951 sci-fi classic The Thing From Another World. Scientists stationed at an outpost on the South Pole are terrorized by a mysterious shape-shifting alien.Themes of paranoia, the unknown, and isolation are very common in the horror/scifi genre and they are well utilized in this film. John Carpenter directs this film with gusto, giving it a terrificly haunting and bleak atmosphere. Ennio Morricone adds all the more to the atmospheric spookiness with his eerie music score. However, the best highlight of The Thing is undoubtedly the awesome special FX of Rob Bottin. Even by today's standards of CGI visual FX, the creature creations of Bottin are truly outstanding. This film was made nearly 25 years ago and still the creepy alien FX of The Thing manage to shock and thrill! An impressive feat indeed.Another highlight is the great cast of the film, the best of which is hero Kurt Russell in one of his most challenging roles.All around, The Thing is a stunning combination of moody atmosphere and out-of-this-world horrors. It remains as one of Carpenter's best films and stands as one of the greatest alien-horror films out there! **** out of ****","

"gheremond","3 February 2008","If you 're not reading this comment just to feel assured that there are other people in this world who share your good taste in films, do yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately. This would have probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, ""The Thing"" really gives ""Alien"" a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop of the horror/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his creative powers (although I consider ""Starman"" to be even better, but this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a would-be apocalypse unlike any""thing"" you have seen before. When I first checked to see how ""The Thing"" was doing on the IMDb scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now, it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason: It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that. Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid. Right from the haunting title sequence (which I think was later also copied in ""Predator"") to the spectacular gore scenes, to the chilling sense of isolation and impending doom created by the gloomy score. Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing, claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team, once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just a horror/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down, but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific ensemble piece. There is also a large amount of carefully timed quality gore, that is utterly mind-blowing. Rob Bottin, the man mainly responsible for the animatronic (although also Stan Winston was also involved in the animatronic work) and make-up redefined the state of the art of what was possible, producing some of the best gore sequences ever that remain unmatched even today. What's more, these effects are really terrifying because they look and feel real and life-like. CGI is nemesis for a horror movie and ""The Thing"" is living proof that if you plan to shoot even a remotely scary scene, make sure you stick to good old latex and makeup.Special mention should also go to Ennio Moriccone's haunting score. I can't believe it was actually nominated for a Razzie! Morricone produced some extremely effective underscore for the suspense-building scenes of the film, communicating all the paranoia of the isolated team and the otherworldly, alien presence that lurks in dark places, waiting to take hold.Overall, I cannot recommend this movie more strongly. It is a rare combination of unparalleled atmosphere, unconventional story and inspired visuals which has stood the test of time admirably.","

After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look into the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear, lent not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct result he ""feels"" like a real person, rather than a hollywood ""all american hero"".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and the net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic film.","

"scorfield-51711","31 August 2016","""Trust is a tough thing to come by these days."" The centre-piece of this feature is the bleak, isolated Antarctic landscape in which the story is set, which Carpenter contrasts so effectively from the outset with the claustrophobic confines of the American research base. The latter was built from scratch at the edge of a glacier in Stewart, British Columbia, with the remoteness of the location shoot exemplified by the cast and crew's hair- raising tales of being transported there. Based on John W Campbell's 1938 story 'Who Goes There?', this adaptation is much more faithful to the source material than Howard Hawks' 1951 original version, 'The Thing From Another World'. Thus, it is ironic that much of the criticism levelled at this production when it was released at the box-office was in lambasting Carpenter for creating such a dark and violent vision in comparison to Hawks' treasured original treatment. In fact, Carpenter not only paid homage to Hawks' original in his version, but also in his earlier body of work. In his 1978 breakthrough, it is playing on the TV set where Jamie Lee Curtis is babysitting, while in this feature the video footage the American team watch to learn what their Norwegian counterparts have unearthed consists of clips from Hawks' version. Carpenter's version's poor critical reception was largely based on its gory special effects, with Roger Ebert dismissing it as a 'barf-bag movie', while Hawks' 1951 director, Christian Nyby, wounded Carpenter by caustically commenting: 'If you want blood, go to the slaughterhouse'. It is clear that by wishing to preserve the shape-shifting alien presence of the source material, and thereby avoid the 'man in a costume' horror of his childhood, Carpenter irrevocably tied his film's fortunes to the quality and reception of its special effects. A second upshot of this decision was in handing total creative licence to special makeup effects creator, Rob Bottin. Having cut his teeth the year previously on 'The Howling', this former apprentice to Rick Baker both thrilled and appalled audiences in equal measure with his nightmarish visions. Though a little dated today, these still retain the power to shock, and deserved at least an Academy Award nomination. In spite of Bottin's laudable workmanship, what they did earn at the time was both a notoriety which deflected attention away from the film's strengths, as well as a period of hospitalisation for Bottin out of pure exhaustion. A further critique aimed at this production was a lack of sufficient characterisation, though it could be argued that with a plot so driven by suspicion, the audience's lack of in-depth knowledge of individual characters adds further to the tension. It is clear that the screenplay, penned by the son of Burt Lancaster whose only other screen writing credit was for the light comedies of the 'Bad News Bears' franchise, is as much of a psychological thriller as it is a visceral horror story. As Carpenter himself later commented: 'The paranoia is the glue that holds the movie together'. This is gradually racked up by the director before reaching its apogee in the film's most acclaimed blood-test scene. It is also supported by Ennio Morricone's throbbing baseline soundtrack, which was so unfairly nominated for a 'Razzie'. Many have questioned the plausibility of the actions of the men trapped on the base with this shape-shifting presence, forgetting that the latter's arrival sharpens the level of mistrust and friction which had been building throughout the team's isolation from the wider world. As such, the alien interloper in its desire to survive at all costs is able to exploit the breakdown of discipline as the team's fragile relationship is tested to its limits under siege. The cast give commendable performances in capturing the escalating tension and dread, none more so than Keith David as the volatile 'Childs' whose belligerence surfaces towards Kurt Russell's hirsute, cynical, renegade helicopter pilot as they bid to take control of the beleaguered survivors. It is fitting that these two characters are the only ones left to await the dying of the flames of their razed base uncertain as to whether their enmity is purely on human terms or one biological organism against another. This is another perfect vehicle provided by Carpenter for Russell's ability to deliver an understated but memorable performance in a role turned down by both Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges. Russell also contributed the final lines of dialogue: 'Why don't we just...wait here a little while...see what happens?' Although now regarded as a cult movie which raised the bar for the horror genre, this production 's failure at the box office marked the last time Carpenter would be entrusted with a major studio, big-budget vehicle, and the virtual end of Lancaster's career, as both were removed from plans to have them bring Stephen King's 'Firestarter' to the big screen. A victim of the timing of its release to audiences warmed to a much more benign vision of alien visitation in blockbuster, 'E.T.', Carpenter's feature has finally accrued the plaudits it deserves.","

"zetes","9 March 2008","This stands next to Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 as one of the great horror/sci-fi hybrids of the era. The film takes place in an American research base in Antarctica. A Norwegian helicopter chases an escaped sled dog into camp, shooting at it with a rifle. When the shooter wounds one of the Americans, they kill him in self-defense. It's probably not the smartest move, seeing as how insanely the Norwegians were trying to kill it, but the Americans take the dog in. Little do they know it's not a dog at all, but an alien life form mimicking a dog. Soon it reveals its true form  kind of  and is burned to death. Unfortunately, it's a crafty organism and has likely infected one or more of the men. But how could you know? It's a perfect mimic, pretty much undetectable until it's too late. The film features some of the best special effects of its time  they have not dated a bit, and are every bit as creepy and nasty as they were in 1982. The monster, when it reveals itself, is a true Lovecraftian thing that takes on all kinds of forms, probably an amalgam of the different organisms it has mimicked over its lifetime. Put the monster aside, though, and there's this great, intense study of paranoia. ""Nobody trusts anybody"" as star Kurt Russell puts it. Reminiscent of perhaps The Big Sleep, if you closely scrutinize the series of events, the plot makes no sense. There's no conceivable way the persons who eventually end up as the thing could have become it. But this lack of logic itself is part of why the movie is so horrifying. You never can tell who is or who is not an alien. Carpenter wisely never lets the audience see anything. Kudos to him for that. And also kudos to him for including two black characters who don't die in the first ten minutes of the movie, an almost unheard of feat for an African American person in a 1980s (or '90s or even '00s) horror movie! A masterpiece of the genre.","

"onewhoseesme","17 May 2011","This is one of the classic Guy films. Horror sci fi as it was meant to be - a real story with good acting. Giving us something missing from almost all horror movies - depth and character. Providing a much needed respite from the cardboard cut outs pasted and slashed throughout, that have been filling the genre for decades. Which has given this style of movie-making it's well deserved reputation and status - of being both Invalid and Not Art. Though John Carpenter himself has been one of the staunchest purveyors of such ilk, it is my humble opinion that he did well with this one, and maybe two others.One of the best uses of curious as a tool, it lures you in a bit unexpectedly with a somewhat whimsical, almost playful beginning. Rich in atmosphere, while stark in landscape - you find yourself as intrigued by the people as you are the monster. The remoteness of the region gives a true sense of the isolation of the real life McMurdo Sound Naval Station (as it was called when I was in the Navy) which is on the very southern tip of Ross Island in the Antarctic, and is the portal for all things going to the South Pole. I think now it's simply known as McMurdo Station, with the story taking place at a small satellite station outside (probably fictional), as McMurdo is mentioned in the film.Kurt Russell who started acting as a kid when I was a kid has never taken Hollywood too seriously, which I've always thought was pretty cool. He's done his share of trash films over the years, but there's been a handful of roles that have more than demonstrated his caliber as one of our great actors. His version of Wyatt Earp is by far the most recognized and almost as good as George C. Scott's Patton. I said almost. He's the center of a strong cast of seasoned actors with many recognizable faces and solid performances. I watched it last night with a good friend who had never seen it, and it was just as good as when I first saw it in the theater - almost 30 yeeeaaars ago. Add it to your library, you'll watch it many times . .","

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","27 October 2015","No horror movie brings you quite the icy, venereal chill of John Carpenter's The Thing. It's an undisputed horror classic that has lived on since it's slightly anticlimactic, ill received release back in the 80's (people didn't know a good fright flick when they saw it back then, I guess). Nevertheless, it's a heart stopping odyssey of ambient antarctic unease, sickening, squirm inducing practical effects, and a veil of impending danger and paranoia that blankets both the characters and the viewer, like the thick drifts of snow that blanket the screen to gorgeous effect. The story by now is timeless: a team of antarctic researchers in a remote location come across a gigantic spacecraft buried in the tundra, and unearth a grotesque, frozen creature that upon being thawed, wreaks havoc on them and their facility. It's an imitator, this monster, and can hide in plain sight, within the flesh and blood of any one of their crew. This gives way to extreme distrust, mental unraveling and mutiny as it turns them against one another. For me there's nothing quite as iconic as the opening: Ennio Morricone's ominous, rhythmical score kicks in as we see two hysterical Norwegians in a helicopter, Chasing a dog across the frozen terrain. It's one of the most dazzling, evocative entrances to a fright flick ever filmed. Kurt Russell, in his whiskered, macho glory plays Macready, the head of the team. Russell is always solid, especially in genre stuff, and he's almost as distinct and iconic here as his Snake Plissken character. T.K. Carter, Donald Moffat, Keith David Wilford Brimley and more round out the rest of the team, and I won't mention standouts because they're all just fantastic and each play their part to a T. A huge highlight is the gruesome creature effects. When the it tries to imitate something and messes up, the result is a grossly misshapen slab of slimy nondescript gore, guaranteed to freak and gross you out in equal measures. I won't spoil anything with specifics, but the dog kennel and defibrillator scenes are time capsule worthy and should be shown in special effects makeup schools as a shining example. Carpenter pulls off the second absolutely flawless horror movie of his career with this one, not an easy feat, especially in this genre. All the parts fit together perfectly, resulting in as chilling sci fi horror for the ages.","

"azathothpwiggins","28 May 2020","Director John Carpenter's THE THING has lost none of its impact over the years. The groundbreaking practical effects set the standard for all ""monster horror"" films of the 1980's and beyond. In addition, the isolation, the barren, frozen surroundings, and the all-male cast, including Kurt Russell, Keith David, and Wilford Brimley, make the setting more like a prison than an Antarctic outpost. Cooped up together for months in this small, dull space, would be enough to drive anyone crazy. Then, add in the most dangerous creature ever to land on Earth, and all bets are off!The ensuing paranoia and terror find fertile ground in the minds of these men. When they should be banding together to face the threat, they are torn apart by something among them... in them... as them.From the classic opening, with the dog and that minimalist score, we know we're in for something different. Many critics hated this movie when it came out, probably because it was such a bold departure from the original movie. Some have since repented.The aforementioned effects, complete with insane, impossible creations in goo and slime, were certainly overlooked by the shortsighted. For fans, this is the True North of all practical FX movies. Carpenter's masterpiece...","

"bensonmum2","17 August 2005","A helicopter chases a husky across the frozen landscape of Antarctica. The two Norwegians chasing the dog seem intent on killing it. The dog makes a bee-line for the American science station in what appears to be an attempt to seek safety. But is that really the dog's purpose? The Americans discover the dog's true mission only after it's too late.I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I hadn't seen The Thing since its initial theatrical run. Because so much of the movie had slowly slipped from my memory, I have never placed it on a ""favorites"" list (until now). In fact, I had forgotten more of the movie than I remembered. I can promise that I won't wait another 23 years for my third viewing. The Thing is a no-holds-barred journey though some of the best that sci-fi, horror, and action have to offer. The movie never lets up and rarely gives the viewer a chance to catch a breath.If you haven't seen this movie in a while (as I hadn't), the special effects will surely have stuck with you. They're gross, disturbing, and an excellent argument against the overuse of CGI in horror movies. Rob Bottin should have won an Academy Award for his special effects work on The Thing.But it takes more than effects and gore to make a ""good"" movie. It's the interaction between the characters and their real feelings of mistrust that elevates The Thing to the lofty status it has achieved. These are men who have worked together in extremely close quarters with little outside contact. Trust is important in this kind of atmosphere. But when it becomes clear that there may be a problem with various members of the group, they're quick to turn on one another to save their own necks. The paranoia is fascinating to watch.As far as I'm concerned, The Thing's ending is perfect. Too many movies attempt to spoon-feed viewers the answer to every question raised in the movie. The Thing leaves you with as many questions as it does answers. Good call, Carpenter!I only have one minor quibble with the movie and it's based as much on my recent viewing of The Thing from Another World as anything. Try as I might, I can't help compare the two movies. I would have really appreciated a better opportunity in The Thing to get to know who these men are. The characters can be described as paper thin. The 1951 movie was more character driven, and as a result, I cared more for the characters.","

"lost-in-limbo","18 February 2006","At a remote Antarctic research station a twelve-man American research party encounter some crazy Norwegians chasing a dog near their campsite. After shooting one of their team members, the Norwegian is shot dead. Trying to discover what made them turn out like this they head to their station, but instead they find something of unknown origin slightly burned up outside in the snow. They bring it back to find out that it's some sort of alien form that's fused together human parts. After more research into it they find out it was buried in the ice for centuries and that it's an aggressive shape-shifter. Soon enough it starts imitating the inhabitants of the base. Causing strained tension and hostile confrontations as everyone starts to turn on each other.Halloween might have been my first John Carpenter experience, but it was this one, which blew me away and got me really into the horror genre. ""The Thing"" used to always get played on late night TV and I never missed the opportunity to sit up and watch it. I always believed that it's the best time to watch this cult classic and on this occasion I did the same again, but I had to watch it on DVD this time around. Since this basically bombed at the box-office, because of the bad timing of its released. With it coming out straight after 'ET'. Pretty much it was suicide. But gradually over the years this has deservedly become a cult favourite through video amongst horror and Sci-Fi fans. The film still holds up remarkably well today and surely was unfairly dismissed when it came out. Also the poster artwork for the film is one of the best I've seen. Carpenter was on a great trot at the time and definitely was at his pinnacle, with such films like 'Escape from New York', 'The Fog', 'Halloween' and 'Assault on Precinct 13' coming before it.'The Thing' is a experimental remake of Howard Hawk's 'The Thing from another World', but instead Carpenter was far more faithful to John W. Campbell's story ""Who goes there"", by getting the alien to conceal itself inside it's victim and never seeing the being in its natural form. Compared with the walking vegetable that had a striking resemblance to Frankenstein in Hawk's version. It's hard not to compare the two, with each one having a stronger point over the other, but for me I have to go with the '82' version. Anyhow, I just gotta say I love the burning imprint of the film's title in the opening. That scene alone sends chills down my spine and tells you what's to come.The story is far from groundbreaking, but the same can't be said about Rob Bottin's daring make-up effects, which simply are astoundingly revolting. Even today they still hold a huge amount of impact in creating a horrific vibe. Really, these grotesque monster effects are incredibly menacing and freaky, but heck these creations are ugly. The gore is worked in rather nicely, with enough blood splatter involved. Like I said the story isn't something out of the ordinary, but the paranoia part of it is beautifully constructed. This is helped by a well diverse group of moody characters that start losing it slowly and Carpenter turns up the notch by seemingly tightening the confines, where the feel of isolation and tension is sustained to the very end. I thought the ambiguity of the conclusion was fitting enough to the overall context. Claustrophobic brilliance on Carpenter's part. Even the story can be class a metaphor about trust and how it's not so easy to come by now. Carpenter creates a very sombre and downbeat atmosphere that goes very well with the cold conditions of the setting. Underneath it all it has an apocalyptic awe about it, where it looks like there's nothing anybody can do about this concealed being. What complements the chilling feel of dread is Ennio Morricone's throbbing score that's simply sublime in awe. The score packs a real unsteadiness and showers the flick with such vigorousness. Pretty much it does alienate you to what's happening on screen.The performances are reasonably solid, though nothing really to write home about. Kurt Russell is perfect as the lead figure and his charismatic presence proves it. The rest are nothing more than pawns in this game of control. They do seem a little bit more one-dimensional, but still they give such raw performances that add more to the realism factor. Also the chemistry between the men is quite believable. Although, one thing that kept on bugging me, was why they would go off alone when that creature is on the loose. Although that helped on the red herrings and crackling suspense. Where the film stumbles a bit, can be found on the script. The characters were more full and dialogue less stilted, in Howard's film. That's were I thought ""The Thing from another World"" really had the wood over ""The Thing"". It built more on the characters. But saying that there was enough suspense built up and sardonic wit in the dialog here. The heated dialog did really warmed up proceedings. The production design is perfect in every inch. From the assured cinematography with many neat angle shots to the creepy, but authentic looking station and its dark and freezing corridors. Another thing to touch a nerve were the echoing sound effects, with the gusty wind making a big impression and the eerie howling from the thing just makes your hairs stand up. Carpenter's ace direction manages to mix gruesome images with psychological elements to achieve an sensational viewing that makes you grab hold of anyone/anything tightly and leaves you with some memorable sequences fresh in mind.A definite Horror / Sci-Fi milestone. Sure it isn't flawless, but it's crafted with a passion to shock, but also compel. Although it's the innovative effects, which will make sure that it's remembered for many years to come.","

"acidburn-10","3 January 2023","'The Thing' is a remake of the 1951 flick 'The Thing from Another World' and this must be if not one of the ultimate sci-fi horror classics. The movie is an intense monster feature directed by legendary horror director John Carpenter that's presented in a paranoid infused landscape of isolation and horrific sights with production drenched in an eerie foreboding atmosphere that's felt throughout its runtime.The plot follows an American research team stationed in Antarctica as they come across a disturbing discovery of a shape shifting alien being that starts to kill of the crew and assume their appearance of each victim.The real star of this flick are the outstanding special effects and the mind-blowing creature design that's wonderfully convincing as it goes from grotesque to disturbing with a wild array of morbid transformations that are genuinely unsettling and detailed to perfection. Everything works in this flick with the claustrophobic shots, the stunning landscapes and the incredible atmosphere that creates a thick ambiance, as well as the compelling mystery which is perfectly paced and keeps you guessing as to who has been consumed by the creature. The haunting original score by music legend Ennio Morricone perfectly reflects the paranoid delusion that's so well crafted on the screen and beautifully the synth scores with John Carpenters stylish filmmaking.The cast here are stellar with Kurt Russell taking on the lead role of RJ MacReady and of course being no stranger to John Carpenter's distinct style, he's fantastic in this role, deadly serious and extremely charismatic with that cool deadpan manner he commands your attention and truly shines in this iconic role. The movie's ensemble cast is what allows this movie to thrive thanks to the excellent characters. The standouts are Wilford Brimley as Dr Blair, Keith Davids as the cool and hot-tempered Childs, Donald Moffat as Garry, T. K Carter as the cook Nauls and Richard Dysart as Dr Cooper, this cast really does a remarkable job with the material as they each inject a sense of ambiguity to their roles.Overall 'The Thing' is just a pure masterpiece through and through, a true gem for any fans of horror and YES this is John Carpenter's finest movie of his directional career.","

"trnjamesbond","18 February 2010","I vote this movie ten out of ten because of the great cast and also the great suspenseful creepy feel of the film the whole deep undertones of the score of the movie keeps you very interested in whats going to happen next every time I watch it. You can tell that Mr. Carpenter had his heart and soul imposed in this tale of great suspense and horror. He was a genius when it came to that. Really wish movies were made like this today instead of props they use CGI which is hollow and see through, especially in lighted scenes CGI looks totally fake but in this film the special effects were so real looking that it still amazes me today. Kurt Russel is so spectacular in this movie I just want to keep watching.You could really tell that there was chemistry on the set between the actors in this film. A perfect combination of great talent great directing and great film work. I always love revisiting this horror classic remake of the original black and white film. Has so much more power than the original because back then Hollywood was so afraid of the world and as I watch old films that are in black and white it's almost as though they dumb down the audiences even though they were much smarter than they thought. Hollywood was different back then they couldn't do anything remotely bold on screen back then because of being afraid it would get banned. Well in this version Hollywood has evolved thanks to movies like the Exorcist,Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien. They have become much more liberal.That's the reason why this film works so well, it's because Mr. Carpenter took a movie and did the things that the original directors couldn't do like add gore and more abstract ideas because back then they couldn't. Another reason why it works is because it's a great story to tell, just ask the question what would you do in this situation stranded in the middle of nowhere being attacked by an organism that adapts to everything it touches. That's what makes this classic retelling so good it's just a movie that has a simple idea and let's the paranoia grow in your mind. Knowing that if the thing touches you your life is going to be mimicked into something that you do not know. I will always love this version don't care about future remakes won't watch it because they will just fill it with CGI and actors from popular teen dramas that's all Hollywood cares about now is how popular the actors are. They don't care about real story telling anymore all they care about is money and popularity. Screw that I'll stick with the classics until they realize what people like and crave so screw Hollywood they don't know how to make pictures anymore it's not about the art it's about cheap thrown together remakes and what makes a quick buck screw'em I'll just keep watching these great masterpieces when they still loved to make a great movie and put their heart and soul into it.","

"Dr_Coulardeau","3 August 2008","This film is a sort of Matrix for many modern films about aliens. It has antecedents for sure but they did not have enough special effects and big enough budgets enabling them not to show the zipper in the back of the monsters. The original element is the location: the Antarctica. A place that has been re-used since by a certain Predator when he met with some Aliens of a more recent generation. There, if an alien life form that can penetrate any living organism and take it over completely appears it can disrupt any human group so much that they will self destroy in order to destroy the alien thing forgetting that anyway the alien form can survive even centuries of glaciation because it is not human or animal and hence it is not even sensitive to cold. The alien is always the winner and it will sooner or later manage to learn how to be patient, penetrate a living organism and stay rampant in it long enough to be taken to real society, to millions of people concentrated in small areas That's the idea of the film. And it ends the way it has to end. Two apparently human beings are still alive. One is contaminated, probably not two, but they are going to die of cold in their human form, their human organism. Carpenter even makes one black and the other white and the circumstances he uses makes the black one dubious, suspicious, whereas the white one seems to be the normal one, but who really knows? The alien or aliens will go dormant in the cold, in hibernation. There is no escape, no end. Our human world is bound to be taken over not by more intelligent beings but by biologically more advanced life forms. And we may wonder if our intelligence will be enough to compensate for the handicap.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines","

"zardoz-13","15 October 2011","Anybody who knows anything about horror director John Carpenter knows how much he idolizes not only Howard Hawks but also the 1951 sci-fi chiller ""The Thing from Another World"" about an alien that tangles with a group of scientists who accidentally thaw out the creature out. Unlike the Hawks produced original, Carpenter and writer Bill Lancaster went back to the premise of John W. Campbell, Jr.,'s novella ""Who Goes There?"" (1938) where the creature impersonates various member of the colony while they struggle to destroy it. No, this horror movie is not for the squeamish. The eponymous monster is a slimy, creepy, critter that imitates the physical characteristics of anybody that it consumes. ""The Thing"" is the best film that John Carpenter ever directed and probably his most expensive. Rob Boktin's creatures are hair-raising, and the scene when the guy gets his arms bitten off at the elbow while he is administers CPR to a dying man is terrific. This tense, humorless, all-male yarn takes place in Antartica in 1982 and opens with a Norwegian chopper pursuing a Husky across the snow-swept terrain. The dog manages to reach another community of scientist before they can kill it and the Americans kill the insane, trigger-happy Norwegian. In other words, the dog survives and is taken in. Before long things start to happen. Kurt Russell stars a MacReedy, a rough and tough helicopter pilot who nurses Jack Daniels throughout the movie and wears a hilarious Yosemite Sam Stetson. Not to be missed. Lots of suspenseful situations.","

The fact that it manages to capture an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere, from the extreme isolation of the situation to a series of brilliant set-pieces at the end to ensure that it'll be impossible to determine who's what when it comes down to figuring out the identity of the alien in disguise amongst them. Chief among these, and a film highlight in its own sense, is the classic blood-test sequence, which is just marvelously done and never once gives away it's secret twist, which is highly creative and makes the film all the better when it's followed by a scene of incredible imagination with its disembodied head gag. It's a running theme throughout the film, of intense suspense followed by rather impressive special effects to punctuate it, all done convincingly and never really allowed to dominate one way over the other in the film. It's action is unparalleled, as the finale is a huge fire-filled battle in the basement, and it's never clear who will win out, and earlier battles are just as impressive as the film utilizes a rather oft-overlooked technique of making something to be feared known to loose in a situation where they can't escape, using the situation to its advantage throughout and never letting it go. Even the gore is impressive, offering tons of splatter to shoot across with reckless abandon and making for a never-ending series of great kills. One of the most impressive films in the genre.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and animals-in-peril","

"utgard14","5 June 2014","American researchers at an Antarctic outpost find themselves faced with a shape-shifting alien that can assume the form of any person or animal it absorbs. The rarest of the rare: a remake of a great film that is just as good, if not better, than the original. I don't know if I would say it's better but it's a damn fine film. I love both movies equally. It doesn't just copy the original. As a matter of fact, other than the bare bones of the plot, it's completely different. It adheres more closely to the short story that both Thing films were based on, which was more of a 'body snatchers' paranoia type of story.The Thing boasts one of the strongest casts of any movie made in the last forty years. There's not a weak link in the bunch. Kurt Russell's MacReady is one of his best roles. Wilford Brimley, Richard Dysart, Keith David, Richard Masur, and on down the line are great actors. Everybody gives their all. John Carpenter's direction is excellent. It's been said by many that it's his best work. It's really hard to argue with that. Surprisingly, he doesn't do the score for this one. Instead the great Ennio Morricone scores it but does so in a manner very similar to what Carpenter himself might have done. Rob Bottin's special effects are terrifically fun in the way only old school effects could be. I can't say enough good things about this movie. It's a classic.

"Sleepin_Dragon","23 December 2023","A shape shifting alien lands in Antarctica, only a small band of scientists and investigators can stop it.I'm sure we all have our favourite John Carpenter classic, for slasher fans such as myself, there's Halloween, for the more gothic horror lover, there's The Fog, and for those that love a bit of sci fi, there's The Thing.What adds to this terrific film's appeal, is that sense of paranoia, not knowing who's who, or if that creature is at large, there are some truly freaky moments.The special effects, I think are the film's greatest strength, they look remarkably good and pretty terrifying, compare that with the CGI of the remake, they just work so much better, credit to the production team.Fair play, that husky did a great job.A horror classic.9/10.","

"Pulpthatsfiction","7 August 2008","John Carpenter's The Thing Is a great classic that not that many people have seen today and for those how have seen this you know what I mean. What makes this film so great is that its so different from any movie I have ever seen. For the most part horror films have bad story telling, bad acting and is usually just bad. Thats not The Thing, The Thing is really a true masterpiece. Everything about it is just perfect, the acting, the directing, the writing just everything about this movie is perfect. The best thing about this movie would have to be the atmosphere in this movie. It feels like your in the middle of nowhere and this thing is around imitating things. I mean it could be anyone it could be you and you wont even Know that its you infected. The musical score by Ennio Morricone is spectacular and one of the best ever. The main part of the score is just to very low bass notes that just puts you in the awkward feeling that you know something bad is going to happen. The acting by everyone is very well done and is believable by everyone. The directing by John Carpenter is pitch perfect, I had never really like John Carpenter directing in any of his movies Until I saw this.","

"LagerLagerLagerShouting","1 May 2008","John Carpenter's brilliantly suspenseful flick is a great fusion of Sci-Fi and horror, adopting the classic body-swap theme and taking it to the extreme. A remake of the Howard Hawks produced 1951 original, Carpenter keeps the Cold-War themes of paranoia and trust as a backdrop of alien takeover and impending doom amidst madness and the isolation of the Antarctic setting. Carpenter's direction as always is excellent as his camera glides through the lonely world of the characters whose inhabitable environment is about to be corrupted by the primordial fear of body takeover. But here and much like the work of David Cronenberg, Carpenter doesn't hold back on the incident, as through some fantastic special effects we are witness to some insane moments of surreal gore. However, he never loses touch with the human side of the story, as in the face of everything shocking happening in front of us, we are left with perceived notions of trust and suspicion.9/10","

"allst","27 September 2003","Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite movie. My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing! The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from N.Y.) In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to do with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting. I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day the last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even the great ""Das Boot"".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror movies: Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're not interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV and watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.","

"GiraffeDoor","2 June 2019","I don't think there's much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said.This phenomenon of a picture has two main selling points:The magnificent practical affects that make a lot of recent stuff feel old fashioned. I feel like I could reach out and touch the things being show (and I could have if I was there). The technical proficiency and the grotesque imagination is perfect for anyone who obsesses over strange organisms. It's striking no matter how many times I rewatch it.The other selling point is that we have a solid piece of horror story telling here. In the isolated wilderness, the routine lives of some scientists finds something that they could never have anticipated. From the very earliest scenes with a helicopter shooting at a dog there is a feeling of unease and mystery that quietly festers among an oblivious crew (but who could have seen it coming)?It loses none of its power as it transitions from chiller, to science fiction masturbilia to taut thriller where you don't know who to trust.If you haven't seen it just see it. This will still be fresh 50 years from now because of its intelligent, folkloric writing and expertise.","

"Foreverisacastironmess123","27 May 2015","Before I even start, if you haven't seen this movie, *go* see this movie! If you enjoy tension and horror in the slightest go and see it, 'cause you will probably love it. It's one of those very special and fearsomely distinctive kinds of horror movies from yesteryear that has the rare enduring charm and quality about it that just more than stands the test of time. I suppose it's a simple and straightforward enough tale of fear, distrust, and most importantly twisted alien abominations, and how they slowly but surely invade and infect the desperate souls who are trapped in a place where none of them can hope to escape or even call for help, which of course just raises the despair and unease to new levels. This group of essentially doomed men must try and prevent the end of the world, provided they can figure out who to trust and who is still human before it's too late... Damn if it isn't so near-perfectly made, everything about it is handled so well and works out so beautifully. The starkly freezing visuals and cinematography is suffused with fear and unseen menace, with the early point in the film where they visit the grim charred remains of the Norwegian camp being especially nightmarish and creepy because unbeknownst to them, that's what's lying ahead. It just draws you right in and makes you almost feel like your in their shoes, and that's one of the things that I think a worthwhile horror picture is meant to do, it immerses you in the environment of what you're watching. I like how the cast are all interesting guys who are different from one another, and while they're not super-developed or anything you definitely care about them enough that you fully share their horror at what's befalling them. I really like the performance of the dog in the opening act which isn't all that it seems, you get a very sinister vibe from it, it doesn't look like your average plain old happy dumb dog, it looks like it's thinking and waiting for something. Way to go dog.. Never looks at the camera once! I don't believe that you can truly love this film without enjoying all the aspects of it, some love it for all the psychological atmosphere, whereas myself I lean more towards the monsterfest splatter side of things(!). But the creature appearances and the mood play off each other, every build-up is paid off, and when the Thing does explode out of nowhere when you're least expecting it, it's really the cherry on the top. I'd put my money on it as the scariest monster ever, I mean what's more alarming than the terror of your own body and mind being stolen and corrupted from within and turned against you? The horrific concept of the parasite taking over is truly used to its fullest potential. As a creature, I see the overall entity of the Thing as a giant all-consuming mouth, with each separate organism a tooth, and all that they can really do is to see how long they can, stem the jaw... The complete carnage of the monster attacks is violent and revolting, but also so undeniably fascinating that you just can't look away, it's like madness given form... My favourite is the sideways snappy-head because the legendary build up to it with the blood test is so perfectly nail-biting to me every time. The moment is so hectic that it's almost absurdly comedic, the way poor frightened Windows has his head thoroughly chewed on before being spat out! It's a picture that really shows what could be done with the technique of practical effects. I could not believe that nobody ever won any awards for those effects, or that this excellent film was so unfairly torn apart by the critics at the time of its release. That was grossly unfair and messed up, but...it does seem indeed that all good 'Things' really do come to those who wait, and over the years it has got every last bit of acclaim and recognition that it always deserved. John Carpenter may not have technically created the idea of the Thing, but it's because of this movie and his awesome vision why people recognise it to this day, it was him that breathed life into it and gave it an enduring(many!) face and identity. My god this movie is brilliant, no other adaptation holds a candle it it, it gave the original story the presentation it deserved. Thrilling, perfectly-casted and excellently written, I can honestly recommend this to anyone that loves gruesome horror or edge-of-your-seat mystery and suspense. This movie is gold, savour it on a long cold night...","

"Boggman","23 June 2005","OMG! ""The Thing"" is John Carpenters masterpiece! I watched this movie fore the first time last night; alone, in my darkened basement and it scared the living hella outta me! This movie ROCKS! Somehow, ""The Thing"" always eluded me. I never knew much about it and never really had an interest in it until I started doing a little research on the internet of horror/sci-fi movies I had not seen.First off, ""The Thing"" holds up marvelously 23 years after its release! In fact, this movie could probably be re-released today and make a ton of money. It's just THAT good. With so many of our classic horror movies being re-made these days; I doubt that this film will ever be re-made anytime soon because it just still plays so very well.Well written, acted, & shot, ""The Thing"" is one heck of a gore fest. The graphic violence in the ""The Thing"" is just amazingly shocking, realistic, and awesome! Quick plot summary: A US research team working in the Antarctic comes across a Norwegian base that has been deserted. They find a dead and deformed body and take it back for research. The end up learning that something has attacked the Norwegians and is somehow shape-shifting with detailed precision into a predatory killer. By researching the evidence left behind by the Norwegians, they find a space ship that looks like it crashed in the snow some time ago.They soon realize they are being stalked, and it could be anyone of the team. They began to lose all trust and confidence in each other and quickly began to turn against their colleagues.Will they find WHO amongst them is a ""Thing""? Can anyone kill this creature before it wipes them all out and infects our entire civilization? Kurt Russel rounds out a very nice cast of actors in this fantastic thrill ride. I was very impressed and satisfied with John Carpenter's ""The Thing"".I cant recommend this movie enough! Enjoy!!","

"HumanoidOfFlesh","10 December 2002","""The Thing"" has to be one of my favourite movies of John Carpenter.It's filled with great acting,moody lighting and jaw-droppingly excellent special effects.Carpenter's direction is great and the tension builds well.There is also plenty of stomach-churning gore to satisfy fans of splatter cinema.Finally there is no love story here(no female characters),no silly humour-just good clean horror!So if you haven't checked this one yet go and see it now!A must-see!","

"hall895","5 June 2014","The Thing is a monster movie with a twist. The monster could be the guy standing next to you. Or maybe the monster could even be you. The story unfolds at an American research outpost in Antarctica. Some crazy Norwegians show up, shooting at a dog. Before the Americans can ascertain what is going on the Norwegians are dead. Soon everyone will realize this dog is no dog at all. It's, for lack of a better term, a thing. This thing can take the appearance of other creatures it absorbs. It can become a perfect imitation of any living creature. So now how much do you trust that guy standing next to you? Paranoia overwhelms the group very quickly. This thing is, quite literally it appears, eating the group alive.Kurt Russell plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot who becomes the leader of the group as they try to stop the thing before it destroys them all. If they don't stop this thing in its tracks and it manages to make its way to civilized areas it will be the end of humankind. So some pressure on our little group then. MacReady is a take-charge kind of guy. But who's to say he's not a thing now? Certainly other members of the group have their doubts. Trust is a commodity in very short supply. Where the film fails a bit is in failing to really establish any characters beyond MacReady. A couple of them stand out because they're portrayed by actors we recognize, Wilford Brimley for example. But it's a largely faceless bunch, not a whole lot of personality in the group. And for a bunch of supposed scientists they're not the smartest group either.The movie has some decent twists and turns, leaving you guessing along with the characters as they try to determine who's still human. It's an intriguing story but it certainly would have grabbed you more if you really identified with all of the characters. As it is there are too many guys whom you really wouldn't care about should the thing make a meal of them. Characters, and the story as a whole really, too often take a backseat to the gore which director John Carpenter piles on liberally. If you're looking for a gross-out movie you'll find few better. The creature effects are very well done but maybe a little too repulsive for some people's tastes. A little more story, a little less blood and guts, probably would have served the film well. It is a very compelling story. You just wish the filmmakers trusted that story enough to allow it to carry the film. The paranoia, the mistrust, there's so much great tension there potentially. But tension loses out in the quest for gory, scary moments. In a movie such as this you want to have some good frights. But you want the scares to enhance the story, not overwhelm it. The balance in this movie is just a little bit off. It's an interesting movie but there is definitely the sense more could have been done with such a fascinating concept.","

"Movie Nuttball","4 January 2004","This is one of John Carpenter's best movie if not his best! In My opinion it is one of the best films to date! I don't want to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it yet but here I will say the following! Kurt Russell was very good! The other cast members including Wilford Brimley, Richard A. Dysart, Keith David, Donald Moffat, Charles Hallahan, and Richard Masur performed well! The movie has many thrilling moments and it does a great job at keeping you in suspense! I just love the unpredictableness! The film is very interesting and is quite scary at times! It has some gore and great effects! In My opinion in the very beginning before the credits where you see the space ship coming toward Earth is one of the greatest special effects of all time and then you see the fantastic Thing logo with such chilling music which is one of the greatest title sequences ever! Morricone's score is very good and it has that great John Carpenter sound! Carpenter directed this greatly and I love how he remade the scenes of the ship in the ice and the hole in the ice block that belonged to the missing corpse! The artwork on the movie box is excellent! If you love John Carpenter, Kurt Russell, the other cast members mentioned above, horror, action, sci-fi, thrilling, suspense, and alien movies then this is the perfect movie to watch!

"Bored_Dragon","24 March 2017","It is considered to be one of the best horrors of the '80s and maybe even one of the best horrors overall?! If that's true I do not want to see the rest of them. I cannot say it is complete crap, but it definitely is waste of time. Extremely overrated nonsense with no purpose. The basic idea is good, but it's not developed nearly enough. Characters are two-dimensional and stereotypical. The movie has no depth, does not provoke thoughts, cannot be more linear than it is, does not arouse any emotions, there's no tension, and finally, it is not even scary at all. There are movies that are very stupid, but make you crap your pants in fear. Stupid but with purpose. This one is not even that. It is as if people who were accustomed to make only low-class action movies their whole lives suddenly decided to shoot the horror. Linear, shallow and boring.4/10","

"hellholehorror","16 April 2022","The shots are perfect. The build suspense with their slow tracking and are perfectly planned with a great beginning and ending. This has to be one of the nicest shot films of this type. It started using the surround a lot but slowly became quite front-heavy. The sound was lacking in dynamic range and sounded eighties in the technical quality. The music was mostly really good but occasionally a bit dated. Dialogue was perfect except afore-mentioned technical problems. This is the definition of paranoid suspense horror. It builds on an idea into terror with perfect film-crafting. The acting is amazing and each character is distinct. The special effects are real and harrowing. Some scenes are so intense that it is almost impossible to take! A near-perfect horror that transcends its b-movie roots.","

"ThomasDrufke","23 April 2017","The Thing being the second John Carpenter film I've watched this week, I'm starting to notice why he's such a ""big deal"" in the film business, but I'm also realizing that his style may not be best suited for my tastes in film. The Thing is a remake of a 1951 Howard Hawks film, which in itself is based on a novella, and the film was once again remade in 2011. Ultimately, this story is widely popular. But the funny thing is, the story doesn't feel all that special or unique. The film adapts the ""whodunit"" or rather ""who is it"" movie trope that has been used for as long as films have been made. I don't have a problem with that, but I do have a problem with this film feeling like a rip-off to Ridley Scott's 1979 Alien film. Right down to the chest bursting scene.Some people may say that the original novella probably influenced Scott in making Alien, which may be true. But then why not change up a few plot points and shot selections instead of feeling overtly derivative from a film that is only a few years old. It also doesn't help that for all the blood, guts, jumps, and scares, we don't really get a look inside the minds of any of these characters. None of them are memorable, even Kurt Russell's flame throwing bearded helicopter pilot. Heck, we never even see the guy fly a helicopter.I hate to keep bringing up Alien, so I'll compare the recent movie, Life. That film doesn't have anything new to add to the genre of ""trapped-in-horror-thriller"", but it consistently entertains you because you get to know each character and you care about them. The Thing's cast consists of a dozen or so men ranging from 30-65, and I don't remember any of their names or backstories. Why? Because the movie didn't take the time to establish either.The Thing does do quite a few things well, though. The practical special effects are mind-blowing for a film from the early-80's. I would love to see some of the behind the scenes featurettes and how they were able to pull off some of the shots. If only the film didn't make me cringe every few minutes with its gratuitous blood spatters and gut bursting shots. The Thing also did a nice job at pacing out the deaths and jump scares where it didn't feel too overpowering at any one point but it also never got to the point of boredom either. Not to mention Ennio Morricone's haunting main theme that plays throughout the film. That will surely send chills down anyone's spine. So overall, The Thing is another Carpenter film to get a mixed response from me. He's a good filmmaker, but I highly doubt I will ever sit down a re-watch his films as religiously as some film fans do. Perhaps I'd like Howard Hawks version better.+Score+Effects-No character depth-Feels derivative6.4/10","

"Gunn","18 November 2007","To the many of you, who like me, gave this film a 10 out of 10 I cannot top your favorable reviews of this masterpiece and I do agree with almost everything you say, so I'll address the comparisons with E.T. made the same year..1982. These 2 films, although Sci-Fi are actually in different genres. E.T. is ""Sci-Fi Lite"" much like Starman, Star Trek, Star Wars, Back to the Future 3 and Galaxy Quest to mention a few. They are warm, funny in some cases, awe inspiring and fascinating. E.T. delivers 100 fold in its genre and is definitely a 10 and a classic. John Carpenter's The Thing is ""Sci-Fi Horror"" much like Alien, Aliens, Bloodsucker and Lifeforce, etc. As a horror flick it delivers with jaw-dropping effects, jump out of your seat action and palm sweating tension, and it, too, delivers 100 fold. It is a classic, still holds up after 25 years and is 10 out of 10. Both are masterpieces and it's not fair to compare them. It'd be like comparing pie & cake. Post Script: I would highly recommend viewing this film on Blu-Ray DVD as it looks spectacular. Children 13 or younger should not see this film.","

"classicsoncall","7 November 2017","Comparisons to 1951's ""The Thing From Another World"" are inevitable with this film, but it's the differences that are palpable. For this viewer, the original movie had more than it's share of unintended comical moments, not always a good thing for a sci-fi/horror flick when they interrupt the flow of the story. I'm thinking in particular of a scene in the earlier film when they brought the 'Thing', encased in a block of ice, into one of the camp buildings, and then proceeded to break a window to keep the room cold!!?? There was also a goofy suggestion to use something hot to throw against the creature in order to subdue it. The best that I can say about it was that it had some witty dialog, and James Arness in an early role as the titled creature, affecting a stance that would later becomes his signature during the opening to the TV series ""Gunsmoke"".The first thing (sic) I did coming here to IMDb was to check this movie's release date compared to ""Alien""; I wasn't sure which one came first. I would have been ready to credit ""The Thing"" with the original chest-burster concept along with the disembodied talking head that appeared in Ridley Scott's masterpiece, but it turns out ""Alien"" was first, three years earlier in 1979. I was kind of relieved about that, I've always held ""Alien"" in high regard as a monster original.But I have to say, this movie works for fans of the genre. It's a bit more detailed than it's precursor, and keeps the viewer on edge trying to guess which of the scientific crew is already infected and ready to terrorize the rest. You even begin to doubt whether Kurt Russell's character is going to come out of it unaffected, but as it turns out, there are no happy campers left by the end of the story. I thought the finale leaving MacReady and Childs (Keith David) as the lone survivors contemplating their fate to be surreally effective.The biggest surprise for me here was seeing who did the score for the picture. Ennio Morricone has supplied some of the best music ever for films in the Spaghetti Western genre and that's where I'm most familiar with his work. A quick peek at his credits here on IMDb reveals he's composed for over five hundred movies! Composing the music for ""The Thing"" might have been something of a departure from his comfort zone, but it certainly caught the terrifying mood of the story. Nicely done.","

"RainDogJr","30 April 2008","Since the very beginning we all realize that is going to be a long and difficult winter for all the men of the research station in Antarctica. Besides the fact that must be really frustrating to be working in a station like that without your family and women, the winter looks even more difficult in part because now they can't make a communication with anybody so practically nobody will hear their screams. That cold and lonely environment is perfect for the story of this film, story of paranoia, human behaviour and unknown things. That aspect of the unknown things is brilliant, first everything starts with an unusual situation: a Norwegian helicopter is pursuing a Siberian husky, trying to kill it. Not knowing why that Norwegian went crazy shooting everywhere, the men of the station kill him and the dog stays there. And since then they start to investigate, first to know more about the Norwegian station and later to know more about a thing that was defrost. Of course thanks to their science skills they obtain great information about what was really the dog and how that thing is able to imitate other life forms. Now the paranoia begins with everybody trying to survive and not trusting in anybody. Here the best part of the film begins with that thing that could be anybody. Of course every team has a leader, here is RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell) who is the helicopter pilot and definitely the smartest and the only who still can think about a possible solution, also realizing that the thing is trying to survive just like them. The last part is just great with the ""still humans"" knowing that they are not going to survive but with the hope that they can take with them the thing. In the end the only thing they can do is to wait there for a little whilesee what happens.""The Thing"" was the first studio film made by Carpenter but it was released just after ""E.T."" back in 1982 and was a theatrical failure but definitely is a terrific film with many great visual scenes; of course the ones when the thing appears are my favourites. The cast is also pretty good with Russell in his best days, just after his escape from New York and now with more hair and beard ala Morrison. The rest of the team is good too and is odd that there aren't women in the entire cast.Conclusion: ""The Thing"" is just another great film of John Carpenter that gained more audience with the video, laser-disc and DVD releases. In these days when in America there is nothing but remakes of the classics, remakes of Asian films, prequels & sequels, mixes between two films and stuff, is almost a fact that another remake of a Carpenter film is coming. Now this film is probably going to be remade and if the thing will be just like in the past years, after seeing the remake where are going to re-watch this 1982 version just to take off the bad taste in our mouths. It's true that this film is also a remake but in this case is more faithful to the original story and is just great.Region 4 DVD: Although the box doesn't say this is the single-disc collector's edition of ""The Thing"". It contains many bonus materials: the really interesting and informative 80 minutes documentary ""John Carpenter's The Thing: Terror Takes Shape"" (the only problem with this documentary is that it doesn't contain Spanish subtitles), the classic director commentary also with Kurt Russell, Production Background with the description of settings and characters, photos of the cast, Production Art and Storyboards (great concept sketches), Location Design, Production Archives, Outtakes and two scenes(frame by frame and full motion), Post Production (cool photos of the premier and posters), Production Notes, Cast and Filmmakers, Theatrical trailer. THAT'S A DVD!","

"gavin6942","21 December 2007","In Antarctica, there is a science station where Americans run experiments... but more often than not just get drunk. One day, a dog and a group of Norwegians shows up... and thanks to poor translation skills, the Norwegian is killed. Soon after, a horrible fate in unleashed upon the American station... one by one the crew become suspects in a very heinous string of murders. Who is the killer or killers? I like many -- perhaps most -- of John Carpenter's films. The original ""Halloween"" and ""They Live"" are amazing. Pretty much the bulk of his work pleases me (with a few exceptions). And ""The Thing"" is among his best, which both fans and critics alike seem to agree on. You are working with horror, which Carpenter excels at... and you are working with isolation fighting against an outside enemy (which we have seen in ""Assault in Precinct 13"", ""Pro-Life"" and elsewhere). And we have the ideal Carpenter cast: Kurt Russell as R.J. MacReady, Wilford ""The Beetis"" Brimley as Dr. Blair and Keith David as Childs.This also brings Carpenter and Dean Cundey together again. Cundey has said, ""John and Halloween really kicked off my career."" This was their fourth film together, but their first big studio (Universal) production. It was truly a passion project for Carpenter, who idolizes Howard Hawks. The Hawks version of ""The Thing"" appeared in ""Halloween"", ""Assault on Precinct 13"" was more or less a Hawks remake, and now he had the opportunity to tackle this. And wow, they did a bang up job, surpassing the original (though the two are different enough that they can both be appreciated in their own ways).The suspense and isolation work to bring the film to a crescendo of horror perfection. And science fiction fans will love it, too (the border between the two is danced upon quite heavily). But what really makes this film the masterpiece it is -- and what will make it never remakeable -- is the special effects. If you have read enough of my reviews, you will know my strong dislike for modern CGI effects and their ""cartoon"" quality. Here, we have a prime example of what I would rather see in a film: good, old-fashioned effects. More realistic than the cartoons and just visually stunning. I have no idea why they started doing things differently, but every film since ""Jurassic Park"" has let me down in some way. Rob Bottin is quite possibly the greatest effects master in cinema history.My one concern with this film, and it is very minor, is that the characters are not easy to keep straight sometimes. This goes away with repeated viewings, but aside from the main characters, the secondary characters just seem to blend together. One guy looks sort of like another, and trying to keep the names straight will take a little focus. Some of them do not appear on screen for more than five minutes or have more than a line or two of dialog, it seems. But what good is a killer if you do not have people to kill? Beyond that, what to say? Keith David and Kurt Russell? That does not sell you? Adrienne Barbeau as the computer voice? A dog that kills people with its tentacles? Even the Internet Movie Database seems to think this is one of the best films ever made (well within the top 200) so I am going to go so far as to recommend it to non-horror fans as well. There is just something very tight about this film.Appropriately, Scream! Factory has pulled all the stops and released the film as a double-disc Blu-ray. With a 2K scan, it looks better than ever. We have commentary tracks with Kurt Russell, John Carpenter and Dean Cundey. And plenty of interviews, both new and vintage. If there is not already a book about the making of ""The Thing"", someone could probably develop one based solely off the material on the set. It is, without a doubt, the must-have Blu-ray of 2016.","

"joesallen-07746","29 October 2022","I had the unbelievable chance of being able to watch this in the cinema for it's 40th anniversary and my goodness watching it on the big screen made it even better and even more tense!Having watched The Thing many times I already knew how the film played out and yet I still felt unbelievably tense and paranoid watching it again on the big screen.It's one of those films that even after the credits roll you have about 100 questions and that is what I love about it as well. The effects work on this film is absolutely brilliant as well and makes me sad that pretty much every movie today uses CGI which just doesn't look or feel as good.One of the greatest horror films ever made and one of the greatest films ever made, a true masterpiece. Please watch it if you haven't and rest assured you are in for one hell of a ride!","

"Ricky_Roma__","27 February 2006","When I first watched it, I wasn't terribly impressed by The Thing. I can't recall precisely what I didn't like about it, that first viewing being maybe a decade or so ago, but I seem to remember finding it a little confusing and I can remember not being a fan of the special effects (some would consider that last statement heresy). But watching it a second time, I enjoyed it immensely. I wouldn't place it at the top of the genre like some people would, but it wouldn't be far off.First things first, I appreciated the special effects a lot more this time round. I think the problem when I first watched it was just how bizarre it all was. Tentacles? Bloody flower guts? Giant snapping mouths? Maybe I found it hard to suspend my disbelief, or perhaps I found it repulsive  I don't mind gore in horror films, but I'm not a fan of what I'd call 'gloop' (for some reason I can happily watch limbs get blown and sawn off, or see people get shot, stabbed and eaten, but my sick trigger is sensitive to 'gloopy' film monsters  I love David Cronenberg's version of The Fly, even though it does make my stomach turn in a couple of places, but I do actually come close to gagging watching The Fly II, and not just because it's cinematic manure). So perhaps I didn't appreciate the special effects for those reasons. But they're actually pretty great. One of the best bits has to be when an imitation human head sprouts a tentacle from its mouth and pulls itself along  and earlier on when the head begins to detach itself from its body. It's nasty and unpleasant and great to watch. And then there's the bit when Palmer's face rips apart and a giant alien mouth sprouts and bites a guy in the head. Neat. (And to make it even better, the man who's getting bitten is shaken from side to side, and in a couple of shots it's obviously a dummywhich is amusing.) But not all the special effects work is great. Although I love the head being ripped off and I love it when it shoots a tentacle from its mouth, it does look silly rather than disturbing when it sprouts antennae and spidery legs. There's a fine line between great and crap. And the bit at the end isn't particularly impressive either  the bit where we see huge tentacles and a massive monster. It's overkill and the effects don't match what has come before.Much better than all the big stuff are the little bits. Right at the end, right before the silly tentacle business and the unconvincing alien dog, is a bit where Garry encounters an assimilated Blair and Blair sticks his hand in his head. It's brilliantly done. And then after that you see Blair dragging Garry along by his face. Again it's sick and nasty, but in a much more believable way.However, it's not the monster that makes The Thing such an enjoyable film, it's the confusion and the paranoia that its presence generates in the humans (I guess when I first watched it as a kid I didn't realise that confusion was the point). After all, seeing as The Thing is a shape-shifter, and it can take on any form, everyone's a suspect.This climate of paranoia and suspicion is best illustrated in the scene where MacReady (Kurt Russell) ties the surviving scientists and workers to chairs so that he can check their blood to see who's human and who's not. The scene really is tense, as you haven't got a clue who's been assimilated and who hasn't. You're not even sure if MacReady is who he says he is, as even he's been built up as a suspect. But it literally could be anybody and the scene's a powder keg.Another great scene is when MacReady declares that he knows for certain he's human and the camera slowly pans across the rest of the group. Do we believe him, and who among the group isn't what he says he is? As well as the scenes of tension, I love the creepy moments too (they're often a lot better than the 'scary' bits). My favourite is when a half assimilated Bennings is caught trying to escape the camp (he's almost a perfect copy but his hands are deformed) and he lets off an eerie howl before he's burnt to a crisp (there's a lot of torching in the filmwhich I love!). And there's also the bit where MacReady visits Blair, who's been locked in the tool shed. MacReady opens a slit and Blair's sitting there by a noose while eating cans of food. He then begs to be let out. He insists that he's much better. It's a superb scene. And as simple as they are, I love all the lingering shots of the dog. It's a creepy mutt, I tell you. It's got a thousand yard stare.Also rather creepy is the ending. After all the pyrotechnics, MacReady thinks he's the sole survivor, only Childs shows up. His explanation is that he got lost in the snow. There's a bit of an awkward conversation, and even though Mac kind of knows that it isn't the real Childs, he's become tired and resigned to his fate and shares a smoke. It's an ending that, in the best way, keeps you wondering.And on a final note, I must say how much I enjoy Mac's snow-sombrero and his bad geography. ""Hey Sweden!"" he shouts when he visits a Norwegian camp. The film's funny, too, and intentionally so.","

"RBrooks","11 August 1998","Hitting the video store late on a Saturday when all of the current films were unavailable, we ran across The Thing in the ""classic"" racks. I've seen this film at least twice before and truly enjoyed seeing it again. If it lacks plot or character development, the premise is frightening enough to make it an engrossing film. The gross-out special effects don't hurt either. For me, The Thing ranks with Alien as one of the best scary films I 've seen.","

"ccthemovieman-1","10 June 2006","This intense sci-fi film is almost horror in nature, a la ""Alien"" as it features a tremendous amount of suspense. If you liked ""Alien,"" you'll like this, the main difference of the two films being the different setting and a different cast.The cast may be different but the characters are the same: scientists-heroes who are all profane low-life-types who you would never see in professions and positions like this. Only in the world of film do you see sleazy people like this in high-tech intelligent positions such as astronauts or scientists. Who better to exemplify this in the 1980s than self-proclaimed macho man Kurt Russell?Back to the positives: besides the great suspense, the story is an involving one that hooks you in fairly early and never lets go. I have a widescreen VHS copy which looks nice, too, since the visuals definitely warranted a widescreen viewing experience.","

"Diego_rjc","4 March 2010","'The Thing' came out in 1982. Back then, John Carpenter was already a quite famous director, with hits like 'Assault on Precinct 13' or 'Halloween'. And with the success of 1981's 'Escape from New York, Universal Studios gave Carpenter a free pass to adapt John W. Campbell Jr.'s short story 'Who Goes There?'. The problem is that 'The Thing' came out only two weeks after Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.: The Extra- Terrestrial'. Therefore, 'The Thing' was a massive fail with the public, and also didn't go well with the critics, saying it was too gore and violent. Now, 28 years have passed, and 'The Thing' acquired a cult status, having the recognition it always deserved - as the best John Carpenter movie. 'The Thing' follows a group of American researchers in Antarctica that are confronted by a blood-thirsty alien creature that assumes the identity of whoever it kills. Now, they don't know who to thrust, and if the other researchers are human or alien. The movie's screenplay is based on a short story by John W. Campbell. Written in 1951, and adapted firstly for the big screen in the same year, this story clearly represents the fear of communists taking over America. But Carpenter's movie came out in 1982, so the Cold War fear is long gone, and he adapts the story in a much more present way. The paranoia subject here is also treated very nicely. The feeling of getting stuck with an alien and to don't know in who to trust builds up along the movie perfectly. There are a few things still unexplained about the movie's story, which proves how well-written this is and also explains why there are so many fans of this. The writing here also allowed John Carpenter to create some of the most scary sequences ever.The cast here is not very big and is composed only by males, and is headed by Kurt Russell, back then a rising star that also had the leading role in Carpenter's previous movie, 'Escape from New York'. He does his job pretty well, as so did all the other actors. Of course this isn't the kind of movie that depends on the acting in order to work - it's all about the writing and the directing. Aside from Russell, that aren't many famous actors, maybe with the exception of Keith David. A name that is worth mentioning is Wilford Brimley. He was certainly the best member of the cast.John Carpenter's directing work is, as always, incredible. He has a very strong style, that is present in every single frame of this movie. He manages to create completely scary sequences out of the nowhere, and it's his directing that keeps the movie going. The movie, like every Carpenter one, has that claustrophobic feel to it, and the way Carpenter handles the characters is simply amazing. The opening sequence - with the helicopter chasing the dog, is one of the best opening sequences in the horror movie industry - it settled the mood perfectly, and showed this was no ordinary horror film.The mood in here is also built by all the other aspects of the movie. The creature design is one of the best in movie's history, and the animations are perfect. As there was no CGI, the movie utilizes makeup to create the illusion of the creatures, and is considered until today a landmark on makeup special effects. It couldn't be better. Ennio Morricone's original music score also did it pretty well, with the use of bass chords pretty common on Carpenter's previous films. The cinematography is also excellent, with a dark and scary mood.Overral, 'The Thing' is easily John Carpenter's best movie. The reception of the movie when it first came out wasn't really fair to what this movie is. But now, 28 years after the release, people finally realized how good this movie is, acquiring a well-deserved cult status. The excellent writing, along with the good acting and Carpenter's perfect directing make this one of the best and most scary horror movies ever made. 10/10","

"Infofreak","24 September 2002","Unfortunately I spend much of my time berating John Carpenter in regards to his recent lazy and mediocre efforts. What a refreshing change it is to relive his earlier  seminal work and remember just why he once had a reputation as one of America's most exciting and inventive film makers! 'The Thing' is quite possible the best movie Carpenter has ever made, and sadly it seems, ever will make. He is at the height of his powers with this dark, tense and claustrophobic thriller, and is blessed with a superb ensemble cast, and (a rarity for him these days) a decent script will believable, fully rounded characters. Kurt Russell gives his best work for Carpenter here, in arguably his strongest performance to date. The supporting cast is flawless, and includes fine character actors such as Wilford Brimley ('Cocoon'), Keith David ('Dead Presidents'), Richard Dysart ('Being There'), Richard Masur ('Who'll Stop The Rain)', and Donald Moffat ('The Right Stuff'). I highly recommend the DVD version of this movie which features one of the most entertaining and informative commentaries I've ever heard. (from Carpenter and Russell) Much maligned when it was first released, 'The Thing' now looks like a masterpiece of paranoid science fiction, one of the very few remakes that surpasses the original version, and absolutely essential viewing for any self respecting horror or SF fan. It really doesn't get much better than this! Highly recommended!","

"Hey_Sweden","6 November 2011","John Carpenters' intense, grim, shocking, and garish monster movie has transcended its poor box office performance back in 1982 to take its place as one of the great experiences of its kind, and one of the directors' finest achievements. A more faithful adaptation of the John W. Campbell, Jr. short story ""Who Goes There?"" than the 1951 Howard Hawks production ""The Thing from Another World"", it gets a lot of impact from the central conceit of the story, dropped by the makers of the Hawks movie.Here, the rampaging alien has the ability to assume the appearance of any living thing that it consumes, leading to an overwhelming sense of paranoia as the men of the story have to come to terms with the reality that they can't trust each other any more.The Antarctic setting is perfect for such a story, with our characters completely cut off from contact with civilization, isolated and forced to work to save themselves. While the story is an extremely serious one, with a tone of dread established immediately, there are memorable doses of humour at select points that provide much needed and highly amusing relief. Ennio Morricones' subtle, scary music, unfairly nominated for a Razzie at the time, is appropriate to the story. Carpenter collaborates with a first rate creative team (especially production designer John Lloyd and cinematographer Dean Cundey) who lend their considerable talents to make an incredible looking movie. Carpenter uses his standard Panavision aspect ratio of 2.35:1 to arrange people and objects within the frame to great effect. Makeup effects expert Rob Bottin creates one of the most striking monsters to be seen in the science fiction genre, displaying a delightful macabre imagination all the way through; the scenes are now indelibly etched in the minds of those that have seen them. (Stan Winstons' contribution, done as a favour in order to help Bottin with the workload, should not be overlooked.)Carpenters' frequent leading man Kurt Russell delivers a superbly understated performance as the reluctant hero MacReady, and receives rock solid supporting performances from a well chosen cast of familiar character actors - Wilford Brimley, T.K. Carter, David Clennon, Keith David, Richard Dysart, Charles Hallahan, Peter Maloney, Richard Masur, Donald Moffat, Joel Polis, and Thomas Waites.Carpenters' somewhat slow pace - at least in the early going - allows the creepiness and sense of mystery to really take hold until the nature of the threat is finally exposed. The story devastatingly illustrates just how ugly things can get when a chain of command is broken and a group of men start to mistrust and fear each other. (It's a brave move on the part of Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster to exclude female characters, something that wouldn't fly nowadays.)No matter how badly this may have fared both critically and commercially back in 1982, its following has done nothing but grown stronger in the over 30 years since its release. It represents a great effort from everybody involved.Nine out of 10.","

"unreasonableboy","4 February 2007","The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies. Of course it was ground breaking special effects at the time of it's release that impressed me so much, back in 1982 it just blew my mind, I'd never seen anything like that! However, although the effects themselves made the movie more horrific, it was the story itself, the music score , the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the doomed research station that makes it a classic. Movies don't get any better than this! In the opening scene with the the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored scientists from some station letting of some steam. Yet when you see them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain of cabin fever. Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score that sets the tempo! You just know that something is not right! At this point it's a mystery until 'the thing' reveals itself. However, the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha Christie ""who dunnit"" ( i.e. ten little Indians movie) sci-fi style as the members don't know which one of their team is really an alien. Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien. The mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses until the final showdown.After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making production the special effects in ""the Thing"" don't carry the same weight as it did in 1982, but other than that it holds up very well all round with some great performances by the cast.","

"kosmasp","30 October 2021","And there is a lot to see - no pun intended. Mainly the special effects of course. Practical effects and they have aged as fine as anything can age. Then there is also the music - fantastic (and John Carpenter let someone else help him - Ennio Morricone to be exact). So having fantastic people in all departments is something that always helps. Behind the camera (Winston, Morricone, Carpenter himself and many more) and in front of it.But I got quite ahead of myself. The movie can be considered a remake of sorts - although it is quite different than the movie that was made many decades before this hit the screens - again no pun intended. The story is strong enough and I do like the original movie too, but it was made with different intentions. You actually will not find many people comparing or calling this a remake. If you search for The thing remake you'll find the 2011 movie - which is not a remake. It is meant to be a prequel to the Carpenter movie.Well this all may be too much to comprehend, but the one thing you need to know: if you can stomach it (this is quite brutal and scary, so not for the faint of heart), this is the definitve The Thing movie that exists, which is based on the short story ""Who goes there"".I could write so many things ... about the thing - but I'll leave it at that - I just will not be able to give you an ending as great as this movie has in store for you ...","

"mnpollio","21 April 2011","There is a good reason why the 1951 The Thing is a classic. Howard Hawks influence is obvious and it packs the excitement, bravado and camaraderie that he brought to his westerns. It introduces us to a variety of characters that are amiable and sympathetic, and balances that with the conflict that erupts between the scientists and military in dealing with the alien threat that confronts them.Looking for anything of similar depth or entertainment value in John Carpenter's woebegone remake is pointless because it simply does not exist. This film adheres a bit more closely to the source novella by John W. Campbell Jr. Carpenter's version adopts an Invasion of the Body Snatchers mentality, wherein a creature ""infects"" others and takes on their appearances to move about at will. It is an interesting concept, but it becomes apparent that the sole interest Carpenter has is in crafting progressively gorier and grotesque effects to gross-out the viewer.The film keeps the same setting in Antarctica and opens with some Norwegians attempting to kill a sled dog. The chase intersects with a group of Americans at a neighboring research facility, who think the Norwegians are crazy. When the dog is sheltered in the American facility, it is revealed to be The Thing of the title. The remainder of the film is basically a guessing game as to who is really human and who has become an assimilation of The Thing.The storyline sounds infinitely more exciting than it plays out. Carpenter has little to no interest in the characters populating his thriller. There are no women at the base and the men have little to no discernible personalities. There is not a role that is not filled by a capable actor, but no one manages to make much of an impression. Even lead Kurt Russell - doing another one of his lamentable John Wayne imitations - just blends into the bland background of bottled testosterone. Unlike Invasion of the Body Snatchers, where it seemed a distinct tragedy that the central characters were being turned into cold, unfeeling beings, the characters in this film are already relatively emotionless and so we feel no tragedy over their assimilation.It is easy to understand why Carpenter has no interest in plot, character development, or even building genuine suspense, his attention is too focused on the next special effects/make-up freak show extravaganza. All of the imagination seems to have been funneled into the next gore scene. The initial scene where The Thing departs its guise of the sled dog and launches an attack on the other dogs in the kennel is revolting on more levels than one can care to count. The dog's head splits open and the tentacled creature goes on a bloody rampage assimilating animals all around into a giant writhing wall of quivering flesh and fur that splits open in various spots to reveal writhing bloody innards. Animal lovers be forewarned. Full disclosure, when I initially attempted to watch this film (and being a fan of the 1951 original) I actually walked out of the theater shortly after this sequence. Several years later, I decided to give the film another chance and made it all the way through to the end.Later sequences are just as repellent. Body parts fly to and fro, chests are crushed, arms are bitten off, limbs take on lives of their own and try to skitter away. Again, lots of imagination, but it would have been far more impressive if Carpenter had channeled this initiative into more substantial areas of his epic. At the time, this depiction was a bit of a surprise coming from Carpenter, whose thrillers had heretofore largely eschewed graphic violence. Here, he makes up for it a hundred fold.Gradually the men are wittled away. Unfortunately, no one cares. There is no sense of urgency or concern for any of these people. They are all unknowable ciphers and easily interchangeable. We truly cannot tell who The Thing has infected less because of its diabolical nature than because the men are all written and played as colorless cookie-cutter tough guys from the average grade-C action film. Carpenter seems to have no idea how people would genuinely act in such a tense situation and there is no camaraderie amongst the men at all. None of them seem to be friends or work well together - they are a gaggle of lone wolf Marlboro Men braving the great unknown. Despite being isolated together and living in close quarters for months, none of them seem to know even the most minor of things about each other.The vague, ambiguous ending with two of the characters resting amongst the carnage, sharing a drink and trying to ascertain if the other one is human or The Thing is exceptionally vacuous. For one thing, knowing that The Thing propagates itself through body fluids, why in the world would the two men chance sharing a drink from the same bottle? Then again, do we really care about either of these guys? The answer would be a resounding no.Interestingly, the film has developed a cult following and fanatics talk about it like it is some sort of a classic. Unfortunately, nothing could have been further from the truth. At the time of release the film was a major box office disappointment and the majority of critical reviews were scathing. In fact, the only people who really seem to consider this some lost classic are gore hounds who think bloodletting should trump storytelling.","

"kclipper","31 July 2011","This is the classic John Carpenter re-visitation/tribute to the original 'The Thing From Another World' which was adapted from John W. Campbell's book, 'Who Goes There?', and it begins like a slick and subtle action in the Antarctic movie just before it gradually develops into a spectacle of mind-blowing special effects and paranoid tension.Kurt Russell, Keith David and Wilford Brimley are among the occupants of a remote research station in the Antarctic when they discover the remains of an alien creature frozen in the ice that is able to assimilate any living organism by reproducing its cell-structure. This premise provides Carpenter with the perfect disposition to build an overwhelming sense of distrust, for anyone could possibly be 'The Thing', and Rob Bottin's make-up crew magically provides some of the most amazing creature effects that still haven't been matched to this day, making this one of the most ghastly science fiction movies ever made. Carpenter has a knack for creating music and tone that induces a feeling of uneasiness and dread, and the William Lancaster script focuses on suspense rather than dialog and characterization. The most memorable and terrifying scenes include; A dog that is actually the alien is abruptly stopped just as it is about to imitate the other dogs in the first scene where the creature shows itself, and not to forget to mention the infamous ""spider head"" scene which for many is the film's most gruesome highlight. This is one of the great films that forged itself timelessly from the world of nightmares and unknown horrors, and will remain as a major contribution to monster effects history.","

"moviemonstersuk","5 May 2008","I think this is one of the best sci-fi horror movies ever. The setting is brilliant, the isolation is total and the paranoia feels believable. The creature itself without giving too much away has a very simple and understandable desire to survive. You can imagine if it had ended up somewhere less remote and although you get little information about its origins it doesn't matter because like the aliens in the movie Aliens you know enough about it to know it's damn scary.The effects have held up fairly well, there are bits that still make me jump but the point is that it's a very well told story and the characters are likable and though thinly sketched also feel like real people. I loved this movie and I have watched it many times since it came out, if you haven't seen it then treat yourself to a night of quality entertainment.I'd rate this gem as highly as Aliens, it's simply brilliant and the dogs acting easily beats most of Hollywoods current 'talent' hands or paws down.","

"briancham1994","26 April 2021","This film is hot on the heels of Alien (1979) with an otherworldly creature taking over a small crew in a limited, isolated environment. The defining feature of the ""Thing"" is that it takes over living organisms to create perfect imitations. This contributes to a sense of paranoid mystery that burns slowly from the beginning, starting with the Norwegians trying to kill a dog which puts everyone on alert. From there, everyone goes insane as they are picked off one by one - but they do not know whom is affected! The special effects of the creature makes it completely disturbing and revolting, while the setting is inhospitable and harsh. The he characters are quite stereotypical unlike the ones from Alien, but the acting is still great when it shows the paranoid panic and violence that afflicts the crew when they scrutinise the creature and each other. Lovecraft would be proud!","

"Smells_Like_Cheese","29 May 2004","I swear I thought ""The Thing"" was a thousand times scarier than ""Alien"". The orginal movie is kind of boring. It's a classic, but this is one of those rare occasions the remake is needed. Besides the awesome effects, the acting is phenominal. Kurt Russell is amazing. How everyone just turns against each other was so natural. The make up was incredable. I couldn't believe that this movie was made in 1982. I think ""The Thing"" is very under rated in it's 7.8 star status. I think it should be higher. Maybe even reach up to the top 250. I'm not kidding, I loved ""The Thing"". I would recommend it.10/10","

"lukem-52760","15 August 2018","The Thing is a true classic movie & has become so well loved & has a huge fan base & i can see why!!!I love this film, the whole creepy atmosphere & dark cinematography by the legend Dean Cundy is superb & the awesome music by Carpenter is excellent & of course the AMAZING practical FX & the awesome casting.........except it's missing the perfect guy for this film the legendary Horror icon TOM ATKINS!!! It makes No sense as to why he's not cast? I mean he was good friends with John Carpenter at the time he had just starred in carpenters The Fog (1980) & Escape from New York (1981) & Tom said in an interview that he had discussed how much he loved the 50's original film & so did carpenter, so they talked about the movie & John must've known how excited Tom would have been to be apart of it & yet he cast every other guy but him? Makes No sense & Tom Atkins would have lifted the movie even more in quality, he would have been the best in it!!! Anyway that was a huge missed opportunity.The cast is an ensemble cast of know the face actors & Carpenter regulars, i love the paranoid mood of the movie & the thick Atmosphere of dread that hangs over the film, this is one of Carpenters best films!!!I used to watch this on video & absolutely loved everything about it & i still do!!! ""The Thing"" yes it's a classic gory horror film & many class this as Carpenters masterpiece, my personal fave carpenter movie is ""THE FOG (1980)"" but i can see why many love this great movie, it's in my top 5 of Carpenters films & in my all time favourite top 20 films list.The always great Kurt Russell (a childhood hero of mine) gives an iconic performance & has created another Classic character as he did in other John Carpenter films such as ""Escape from New York"" & ""Big Trouble in little China"" as we know Carpenter & kurt work perfectly together.Kurt Russell is awesome,cool & iconic as ""Mcready"" & the location is isolated & scary & like i said the fx are amazing so much better than the silly cheap looking c.g.i today!!!The Thing is a Horror CLASSIC.I love John Carpenter films & i consider him my favourite Director.All in all this 1982 sci-fi Horror is a Classic of it's genre & is one of Carpenters best films!!!Check out the equally excellent ""The Thing"" 2011 prequel, it's just as great & surprisingly still very atmospheric & exciting.","

"DanLives1980","5 October 2011","Very few horror films remain locked under cult favourite status while at the same time being hailed by critics and widespread audiences as possibly the greatest horror film of all time.While it has been pointed out by movie legends such as George Romero and Stephen King that people love being scared by a good horror movie, it is not specifically the case with majority audiences. Films such as The Exorcist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween may be classed as the best of all time, they have also proved too much for the mainstream, who like their horror slightly more psychological, less physical and most often promising a happy ending.This may explain why master filmmaker John Carpenter's 1982 powerhouse science-fiction horror 'The Thing' did so poorly at the cinema box office, besides the unfortunate fact that the darling of Hollywood, Steven Spielberg, had released E.T: The Extra Terrestrial at the same time.The film is cold, dark, uncompromising, you can cut the paranoid and petrified atmosphere with a knife, but you'd do better to incinerate it with a flamethrower just to feel that little bit safer before you go to bed. There are no warm and endearing characters to care for, every moment this mysterious but absurdly terrifying Thing from another world strikes, you are left with goosebumps, your imagination running scared and out of control and in the end... have you made up your mind how the end will come? An American Scientific Research base isolated in the Antarctic finds itself witness to an incident where the members of a not too distant Norwegian base have seemingly gone mad. The Norwegians are killed in regrettable circumstances. leaving no answers as to their actions leaving chronically drunk and depressed helicopter pilot MacReady with no choice but to fly a couple of the concerned scientists over to the Norwegian base where they discover a horrific aftermath of grisly death and destruction. The remains of a mutated and seemingly inhuman corpse is found within the cinders of a burned out bonfire and very quickly the tone is set and the scientists' reality turned upside down.Aliens are amongst us! Very quickly, shock and disgust turn to fear, fear gives birth to anger and paranoia sets in deep as the remaining life-form next targets the American base and secretly multiplies within their ranks in the hopes of outnumbering the remaining humans before it is discovered and destroyed.Hopes of containing the alien life-form, before it is discovered that it is not only an intelligent life-form but also a very contagious one, fade very quickly as the whiskey and sleep deprived R.J. MacReady - played with literal ice cold awesomeness by the one and only Kurt Russell - and the few men he feels he can trust begin to fall apart under the strain of fear and isolation, setting themselves apart from those they feel will only lessen their chances of survival.As time grows short and the numbers die off, it becomes clear that nobody can be trusted and the only way of stopping this nightmare is by effectively ending their very own chances of survival.Carpenter writes possibly his best ever script, the scenes setting the way for a nightmarish Cold War paranoia tale where the fate of the world could very well be put at risk by the fears of a handful of men. There is nowhere to run and hide. Outside, Antarctic Winter is setting in and deadly sub-zero temperatures make it impossible to escape. Where safety in numbers ought to make a man feel safe, the danger is multiplied and to sit alone in the dark is practically suicide. The dog pound is a slaughterhouse, the medical bay is contaminated, people are losing their minds and cabin fever is setting in and the Thing never sleeps...An eerie theme by musical genius Ennio Morricone sets the tone; dark, depressed, suspenseful and doom-inspired. Master of animatronic special-effects Rick Bottin provides the most ghastly practical horrors ever devoted to film and a craftily untypical and notably mature ensemble cast (Kurt Russell, Keith David, Donald Moffat, Thomas G. Waites and Wilford Brimley) provide a sense of reality that no kid that wants to make yet another slasher/zombie flick could ever hope to.If you haven't seen this film before and for some reason you have an intolerance to anything outside of CGI, pop music soundtracks, laugh a minute characters and damsels in distress in any shape or form then I dare you to see what a real horror film is and watch this. Call it an education because there is not a director out there who will ever rival John Carpenter or make a film as cold and creepy as The Thing!","

"Rammstein-2","7 November 2000","This is an interesting film, mainly because it is one filled with some of the most disgusting special effects I have ever seen - though I admit that I am fairly new to horror flicks of this kind.What's good about it? For one thing, it is a very clever touch not to reveal who has been infected and who hasn't until it is absolutely necessary. It is completely impossible to tell who is who, and the suspense raises sky-high because of that.Also, the performances are actually pretty good, considering the cramped confinement of the set and the sparse and somewhat lame dialogue. These are ordinary men talking, though most of them seem to be more or less criminal in some way.The beginning is very clever, and it takes quite a while before one gets the hang of why these crazy Norwegian are so eager to hunt the dog with machine guns and hand grenades (!) that they injure one of the Americans in the process. Of course, the first time I saw it, I knew what was coming, but it makes it better nonetheless.I have a favorite scene in this movie, it is one I will remember forever: when the doctor is trying to resuscitate one of the team members, who has been infected, he gets his hands caught in some weird mouth that opens right in the guy's chest. That is awful. It doesn't matter much that the doc's hands seem to break off by themselves...What else? Well...it's a cult classic, and deserves it. Like many of those, it's very far from brilliant, but are nonetheless very good and entertaining to watch.","

"TheOneThatYouWanted","20 September 2023","This is one of John Carpenter's favorite movies for a reason! It is so, so, so very outstanding!A good old fashion classical punch in the face. And this thing builds and builds. Funny how much value in a horror film you can get it of just by having a basic plot mixed with flushed out characters. This monster is a relevant today as it was in the 80s as it was in the 1950s version. Pure brilliance of the direction of a masterful director. They will never make another movie like this! You had to be there! There is simply nothing in the world of entertainment like this masterpiece of high art! I love it all!","

"poe426","4 February 2005","The critical response to THE THING was par for the course: having been brainwashed by kiddie corn like E.T., they could hardly be expected to view objectively what has turned out to be a timeless masterpiece. From an opening evocative of any of a number of 50's sci-fi schlockers (not to mention the closing moments of Carpenter's DARK STAR, itself) to an ambiguous though not unsatisfying ending, it's clear that this masterfully macabre monsterpiece is a bona fide tour de force- a coup de grace, par excellence.The 50's version, which plays out more like the James Whale FRANKENSTEIN, pales by comparison. Carpenter is a meticulous craftsman (he has contemporaries, but no peer) and, for those of us who like our flights of fancy tempered with a bit of storytelling, he does not disappoint: by simply returning to the source material and notching up the suspense in his patented manner, he and scenarist Bill Lancaster have fashioned a claustrophobic chiller that plays the e-t incognito exactly the way it should've been played the first time around. The players, to a man, are excellent. Carpenter's overriding concern is clearly this band of enjoyably eccentric misfits and their reactions to the malevolent monster in their midst. He navigates the tight rope between fantasy and reality like an expert. (Which he is: this is his frightening forte.) The ""thing"" itself is truly the stuff of which nightmares are made: the movie showcases, without catering to, some marvelous mechanical makeup effects by master monster maker Rob Bottin. Under Carpenter's artistic aegis, these effects are utilized as dramatically as possible. If there's another candidate in the running for greatest monster movie of all time, I haven't seen it. Nothing else comes close.","

"perica-43151","10 July 2018","Few movies manage to outdo so many things as this one did. Better the first version of the movie, check. Be arguably better than one of the classic cult masterpieces, namely Alien, of the time, that it was originally accused of being a ripoff, check. Be vindicated as a cult masterpiece in time despite of negative reaction from both public and original critics, check. Be inspiration for many movies that followed, but never approached the original, check. Bring novelty on many levels, check. Have innovative special effects that look WAY better, more convincing and frightening than any CGI produced by modern supercomputers and expensive teams of animators decades later, check. Having memorable atmosphere, keen fan base and generally being perfect even in its flaws (that play as a lovely curiosity, like the chess engine), check.In short, there is a good reason this masterpiece is loved. It is, because it has and always had substantive true value. Together with Blade Runner, now remembered as one of the best sci fi movies of last century, but also transcending many genres, this is one heck of a GREAT movie.","

"barnabyrudge","27 June 2004","Based on the famous short story Who Goes There? (which was previously filmed as The Thing From Another World), this 1982 version of The Thing is an exciting and fairly gruesome slice of science fiction. It has its fair share of shortcomings, which I will mention later, but on the whole this is a commendable film. A bunch of US researchers at a secluded Antarctic base rescue a stray dog. Little do they realise that the dog's body has been inhabited by a deadly alien organism which can take the shape of its victims so that no-one knows it is there. Seems that some Norweigan scientists at a nearby base unearthed the murderous extra terrestrial from the ice, where it had laid frozen for hundreds of thousands of years. Pretty soon, the guys in the American research team are being infected by ""The Thing"" one by one.... but how can they tell who is who when it can imitate any one of them with such accuracy? The Antarctic setting complements the suspense perfectly. The isolation of a scientific station in the middle of nowhere is an ideal metaphor for the fearful isolation that each character experiences, miles from help and surrounded by other characters who may or may not be what they seem. Rob Bottin's make-up effects and Albert Whitlock's visual effects are memorably (and intentionally) unpleasant. And some performances, notably Kurt Russell as the suicidal hero, are absolutely spot-on. As I touched upon earlier, the film has a few shortcomings. There is never a satisfactory explanation as to how the alien actually infects its victims, and some moments near the end seem illogical (e.g. what's going on with A. Wilford Brimley's character in his last scene, and why does Keith David go running around alone knowing that the alien is on the prowl?) Also there are clumsy goofs - for instance, it is widely-known that Antarctica experiences six months of uninterrupted daylight and six months of uninterrupted darkness, so how come day and night occur on a daily basis in this film? The film is best enjoyed as an exercise in suspense and a show-stopping display of innovative special effects, but if you start to unpick the plot in closer detail the holes begin to show.","

I've gone to sleep with more comforting thoughts.When the rest of these idiots are not smoking grass or pouring liquor into their electronic equipment (that was smart), they try to help figure out what to do next, however futile their various suggestions and actions may be.John Carpenter's take on the 1951 'classic', though you might want to take a rain-check on this and watch the original instead.","

"hnt_dnl","18 August 2013","Being a fan of several of John Carpenter's early oeuvre of works (Halloween, The Fog, Big Trouble in Little China, They Live), I've got to say that I was disappointed in recently getting around to watching his remake of THE THING (1982) and am a tad surprised by how revered this movie is. Having seen the original 1951 Howard Hawks' classic a few times, I was stunned that Carpenter's remake is actually SLOWER than the original film, which moves at a brisker pace, never lets up, and is still fun to watch even over 60s years later! Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a ""slow"" film if there's a method to the madness, but there is none here. The Thing just drags and drags and drags and really goes nowhere.Not to mention, I was not much impressed by the casting in this 1982 remake. I thought most of the performances were rather monotonous and lifeless throughout, which a bunch of interchangeable characters. Even the usually reliable Kurt Russell really brought very little to the table in terms of personality. The ONLY character the remotely piqued my interest was the one played by the veteran actor Wilfrid Brimley, and low and behold, Carpenter sidelined him for virtually the entire 2nd and 3rd acts! Other than the talented Brimley, the rest of the cast was literally just there.Getting off to an interesting start, with an alien spaceship hurtling toward Earth, we are immediately introduced to the crew of an Antarctic research and discovery station, who witness the pilot of a helicopter from a nearby station shooting at a seemingly harmless dog. The station captain kills the pilot and they take in the dog, who turns out is an alien beast that kills it's prey, then replicates them in every detail. So that this remake ends up functioning as a mystery-whodunit, as the station crew become paranoid (although it's hard to tell through all the mediocre acting) for the rest of the movie not knowing who is really who.I found this remake to be overly long and very slow. It literally got to a point where I thought the film was over, then it went on for about another 45 minutes! Some of the stuff in the climax was kind of interesting, whittling down the crew to the remaining ""humans"", but the getting there was very tedious. I found it strange that as soon as they found out they were dealing with an alien life form, none of them seem flabbergasted or blown away by their discovery. Also, I wondered why they didn't try harder to call for help as the alien threat became increasingly ominous. Plus, the ending left a LOT to be desired. A bit too ambiguous even for my taste. Also, the initially shocking, gory effects wore off quickly as the film progressed and became redundant.Carpenter's film usually have a penchant for thrills and suspense (see aforementioned movies of his that I actually LIKE in my first paragraph), but this one strangely left me cold (pardon the pun!). However, I do give it points (thus, the 5 out of 10 rating), for having some obviously unique (if a bit too gory) effects and piquing my interest early on, just not being able to maintain my attention.","

"Tweekums","4 January 2012","From the beginning the viewer knows that there is something alien in the Antarctic as we are shown an alien vessel in the opening scene. The next thing we see is somebody trying to shoot a dog from a helicopter; as the dog reaches an American base it looks as if the people in the helicopter aren't quite sane as the man with the rifle wounds one of the Americans while trying to shoot the dog; realising they are in danger they shot him and take the dog into their camp. Of course this was a very bad mistake; one which will cost many lives. The dog wasn't actually a dog; it had been taken over entirely by an alien creature at a cellular level; an alien that isn't content to take the form of a mere dog! When the people realise what they are up against paranoia sets in; anybody could be alien and nobody trusts anybody else. Each time they thing of a way to identify or beat the creature it is thwarted and eventually they realise if they are to prevent it getting off Antarctica and infecting everybody on the planet they may all need to die.This is a classic horror where a group of people are trapped in a confined area with no means of communication or escape to the outside world. In the respect it reminded me of the superior 'Alien' although the way the alien here could mimic its victims increased the sense of paranoia. The effects looked pretty good and were delightfully grotesque in a way that could only be achieved with models and make-up rather that the CGI that would inevitable be used today. The cast, led by Kurt Russell did a fine job as did director John Carpenter; they managed to keep the frights coming right till the end and even then there was some ambiguity about the creatures survival!","

"HorrorDisasterGuy-90617","8 September 2023","The story is done really well and is developed throughout. It's interesting with a movie about a alien parasite that imitates other organisms and the characters trying to stop it. The creepiness factor works really well on how its mostly paranoia on how the characters starting to learn that they no longer trust each other due to one of them being a imitation. We see how the characters try to figure who is a imitation and how to survive against it. And they make a couple of good decisions throughout that helps them stay living for a while. The atmosphere works out well with it taking place in a isolated environment with no way on escaping and how cold is it. Also the movie have a lot of suspenseful moments in it and makes the climax really enjoyable. One thing this movie does is having mystery to it. There's about four scenes that left a mystery and it's never revealed who or what happened in that current scene. It works really well over the atmosphere of the movie and its really fun to come up with theories for each of these mysterious scenes and try to figured out what really happened.","

"view_and_review","10 September 2018","You know what I appreciate most about this film? The title. There are hundreds, if not thousands of movies out there about foreign creatures and a lot of them have the name of said creature in the title: Gremlins, Ghoulies, Critters, Alien, Leprechauns, Pumpkinhead, etc. This movie kept it--as they say--100 (or as we said when I was young, ""real""). They didn't know what it was and I know that when I don't know what something is, it's a ""thing"".The movie was as good as the title. This was a quality production for 1982 and one harrowing situation. Imagine being stuck in Antarctica, nothing but ice and polar bears around for hundreds of miles, incommunicado with the rest of civilization, a deadly storm brewing, and a creature in your midst that consumes its host and assumes its identity. I, for one, would be scared to death. If it weren't for everyone else having the same fears I'd have thought that cabin fever had set in and was causing me to be paranoid.""The Thing"" played out exactly how it should have. There was rampant fear and distrust with everyone ready to take the life of his mate at any moment. The few times this thing showed itself it was a thing of nightmares and again I have to say that it was good special effects for the 80's. I never saw this movie as a kid, thank God, but seeing it today I know I would've been spooked watching this.","

"Taske95","4 November 2022","I watched this film for the first time in 2022, exactly 40 years after its release. John Carpenter has created a masterpiece that will last forever, partly because there are no CGI effects in this film, so everything seems more real and therefore scarier, and partly because film effects are outstanding. This film puts forth a lot talent in all departments but what singles it out for me is the story. It really jumps off the screen and let's you maintain a close relationship with the characters but also remain separate enough to just observe the situation. This atmospheric film will forever sink into the parts of your mind, and live in you without you even noticing ;)","

"FlashCallahan","10 April 2015","An American scientific expedition to the frozen wastes of the Antarctic is interrupted by a group of seemingly mad Norwegians pursuing and shooting a dog. The helicopter pursuing the dog explodes, eventually leaving no explanation for the chase. During the night, the dog mutates and attacks other dogs in the cage and members of the team that investigate. The team soon realises that an alien life-form with the ability to take over other bodies is on the loose and they don't know who may already have been taken over.....It seemed in the eighties, well the majority of the decade, Carpenter made a career defining movie, every time he made a movie, especially if it starred Kurtz Russell.He changed the face of horror for over twenty years with Halloween, Changed the attitude of Science Fiction with Escape from New York, BTILC, They Live, and this, probably his greatest film of the eighties.And it's great because its so simple, it's tense because you put yourself in their situation, in the middle of nowhere,with literally nowhere to go or to hide, and not being able to trust anyone.And that's the premise, it could be any film, any genre, any setting, but the fact that its in the middle of the coldest place on earth, and the inclusion of a body morphing alien, that generates the terror, and it generates it in droves.Before anything happens alien wise, there is still an air of tension between the crew, after all they are confined to the setting, so they must get tired of each other from time to time.And then the dog arrives.After that, it just goes bonkers, and even almost thirty five years after its initial release, those special effects are still amazing, oh to see this on its initial release must have been something else.The cast are brilliant, Russell appears and acts a lot advanced in his years, and the film keeps you guessing until the end.If you do enough research, one of the survivors isn't as he seems during the final reel, and it makes it all the more chilling.Groundbreaking stuff.","

"Aylmer","21 December 2021","Over the years this film is up there with ALIEN and DAWN OF THE DEAD as the horror movie I have gone back and rewatched the most times. There's just so much to appreciate. Much like both of those films, it is not strictly of one genre. It is a horror film as well as a psychological paranoia thriller, an explosion and gunfire-filled action movie, and a plausible science fiction movie. On top of that, it vaguely realistically depicts life in an antarctic research station, a setting that has not yet been fully explored to my satisfaction. There's a few goofups there such as an antarctic base housing a subterranean generator room (wouldn't they be concerned that such a thing would melt the ice out from under the buildings?).It's the mindblowing special effects that make this film so memorable. Body horror and transformation effects have never been so gooey, gross, and realistically done outside of one or two David Cronenberg career highlights. Much like Cronenberg, Carpenter complements the effects with a grim and uncompromising tone that never falls into camp or forced comedic relief. Thankfully there is zero romantic subplot at all to get in the way of things, which focuses the film in a way that few horror movies do. Sure in ALIEN and DAWN, characters seemed to have preexisting relationships but none of it drew particular attention away from the horrific goings on. The characters here feel a little underdeveloped on first viewing but they feel like real human beings with realistic reactions to their surroundings and little expository dialog.My favorite characterization in the film goes to The Thing itself, which acts more alien and animalistic than aliens in any other film. When we think about how contact will go with an extraterrestrial organism, it's easy to make it either fully hostile or friendly and all-knowing, without fully examining the middle ground that it may be even more fully evolved to focus exclusively on its own survival. It doesn't really care about communication or technical achievement. It's just out to defend itself at any cost.This gives rise to many intriguing concepts that the film hints at; what is consciousness if an alien can replicate and project the personality of a human so easily? Is someone infected or replaced by a Thing even aware that they are no longer human? Is the Thing more like a virus or a collective animal such as a Portuguese Man-o-War with certain cells' sole function to perform specific tasks (such as stinging or ""taking over"" other organisms)? What we see the creature do leads to more and more questions, which leaves the door wide open for further explorations of this universe through novelizations etc., an abhorrent prequel, video games, and, best of all, our own imagination.The Thing is an intriguing, shocking, and exciting film. It's hard to find a lot of flaw in it outside of a few banal lines and continuity goofs here and there. My main complaint is that didn't go a little further in depicting alien behavior and could have used a much more clever finale than the somewhat disappointing standoff that we get. It's almost as though the budget ran out or the crew and screenwriter all just collectively got tired toward the end of the process after creating so much brilliance for 90 minutes.","

It is somewhat funny, the spin history can put on things, because now as a Lucas-like special edition has failed to reinvigorate interest in the family-friendly box office hit, The Thing has found a new life as a cult piece. This is not to put down Spielberg's career-building piece, as it is a well-made film in its own right. But years after I have forgotten Spielberg's effort, and dismissed it after he tried to make even more suitable only for infants, I still remember the mood it put me in, the first time I saw The Thing, and watched as the creepiest score I have heard in at least a thousand films played over elegantly understated credits. Put simply, The Thing should be shown to film-making students as an example of how you build suspense.The film starts out innocently enough, with what appears to be a husky running from a helicopter as a (lousy) sharpshooter tries to kill it. Running and flying into an American research station, the husky tries to bond with the present staff as the sharpshooter emerges and tries to warn them in broken-sounding Norwegian. As the helicopter is accidentally destroyed and the sharpshooter shot dead, the husky works its way into the confidence of the camp, eventually placed in the kennel at the insistence of one of its edgier residents. The new husky soon reveals itself to be an alien creature, not that this is any surprise to the audience. As the alien absorbs the other huskies, the men at the research centre are fortunate enough to get to it before it finishes. Whether one of them has already been absorbed before two of them pay a visit to the station the Norwegians came from is a matter of debate, but things take a definite turn for the worse when they bring back some artifacts from the site.Screenwriters like Ehren Kruger could learn a lot from The Thing. Although the scenario itself is incredibly harrowing, especially when you consider what could happen if the chameleon found its way into civilisation, its the details that make the story what it is. One of the men, considering the what could happen question, destroys every means the team has to call for help or leave, cutting them off completely. While most of the others do nothing quite so dramatic, their anatognism towards one another makes scenes that would normally be test patterns into something that may make viewers bite their nails. In contrast to the The Thing From Another World, this tension comes from the important fact that destroying the evil alien is almost secondary to identifying it. And in one of those happy coincidences, the scene where our hero does learn to identify the alien is far from the end of the tension. In point of fact, the scene in which he administers the test to identify who has been absored is unequalled in American film when it comes to tension. I still leap out of my seat in the quick shot where the ""infected"" blood sample is tested.Although it is generally bad for a film to rely on its special effects, both the story and said effects are top of the line here. The Thing was the eighth film on which Rob Bottin provided special makeup effects, and is among the films cited when his godlike reputation in the field is discussed. Regardless of whether one considers makeup effects an extension of special effects or otherwise, both can be summed up as an art where the goal is to fool people into believing they are seeing something they're not. I doubt that anyone is going to believe they are seeing an alien organism of any kind until it becomes commonplace, but like the acting, writing, and music, Bottin's artwork is a wall in a tense atmosphere that dares the viewer to look away. As in all the best films that ask the viewer to accept unreal elements, The Thing does this the right way, by suspending disbelief in graduating steps. By the time the most outrageous unrealities are unleashed upon us, we have been so drawn into the world of the story that there is no going back. It never ceases to amaze me how much the filmmakers of the 1980s could get away with in terms of stretching reality compared to their present-day cousins.This would be (at least) the third of many collaborations between Kurt Russell and John Carpenter. The two never work better than when they work together. Russell has shown a number of different modes under Carpenter's direction, from the loud arrogance of Big Trouble In Little China to the hoarse understatement of Escape From New York. In The Thing, Russell starts at the latter end of his acting spectrum and ends a couple of steps toward the former. Not that Russell is the most versatile actor in the world, but this film calls for an everyday man type, and Russell more than fits the bill. The audio commentary recorded for the Laserdisc goes into the less than noble motivations the men have for being at the research station, and Russell is best among this cast at giving the viewer a character they can see the events through the eyes of. Not that the rest of the cast let the side down in any way. Everyone from Wilford Brimley to David Clennon gives their character all three dimensions, and the story benefits enourmously from it.I gave The Thing a ten out of ten. In a season of remakes for the sake of remakes, see this for an example of a remake done right.","

"jcbutthead86","27 May 2012","John Carpenter's The Thing is in my opinion the Greatest horror film ever made. A brilliant mixture of great direction,acting,special effects,score and screenplay making this a all time classic horror film. This is Carpenter's greatest film and It's not only my all time favorite Horror film it's one of my favorite films of all time period.The Thing tells the story of 12 researchers in a u.s outpost in Antarctica with nothing really happening until the researchers discover that an alien that came to earth years before is stalking them and killing them and imitating them. Which raises the question:Who can you trust?Released in the Summer of 1982,John Carpenter's The Thing came out at a bad time having been released three weeks after Director Steven Spielberg's Blockbuster E.T. The Extra Terrestrial a much lighter take on Alien life and The Thing was ignored by audiences and hated by critics. Thankfully,The Thing has become a Cult Film and is now considered a classic and one of the best Horror films of all-time and the praise is rightfully deserved. The Thing is a film I love for many reasons because it brilliantly works as Horror film and Remake. One of the reasons I love the film besides the direction and special effects is the paranoia aspect of the film and when the characters stop trusting each other and start wondering who's human and who's not and Carpenter creates a dark end of the world feeling where the end will come from either aliens or man's own disturbing self destruction. The film is scary and frightening not just because of the effects and atmosphere but because of the characters and how they react when the alien invasion happens. It's very believable,scary and gives the film it's edge. This film was released before AIDS and HIV was more known around the world and Carpenter's film could be a metaphor. Even though The Thing is a Horror film,the issues and themes of fear,paranoia and distrust is still relevant in today's world.The screenplay by Bill Lancaster is superb and well-written giving the film and characters great lines and dialog. We don't know much about the characters and who they are but,we know them well enough to feel sorry for them and don't paint the characters as faceless victims. The snow and cold adds to the dark and frightening claustrophobic feel of the film and you feel isolated like the films characters where you feel that there's no where to go and no salvation for the men. The only film that can match the chilling and dark atmosphere is Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. Both films in my opinion are the two of the most terrifying films ever set in the winter and make me never,ever want to stay in a house or a hotel by myself in the snow. The Thing also succeeds as a remake and one of the rare occasions where the remake was different and better than the original.Where in Howard Hawks The Thing From Another World the alien was a big and large Frankenstein-like creature,The Thing in this film looks different every time it transforms so the alien can look and different and sound different each time and it's very inventive and terrifying. The Thing was the first in Carpenter's great apocalypse trilogy which also includes other Carpenter classics Prince Of Darkness and In The Mouth Of Madness. While none of these three films have nothing in common in terms of story lines or characters the thing they all have in common is the concept about the end of the world. The Thing is my favorite and the best of the trilogy because of the storyline themes,characters and great ending which has been discussed for many years. The Thing also moves at a fast pace and never slows down until the very end. The violence and gore in the film are intense and brutal truly match the horrifying tone of the film and the violence happens you as the viewer will feel it and will be disturbed. The ending of The Thing is uncompromising,dark and will have viewers talking about the ending for years,leaving you with many unanswered questions than easy answers and wouldn't fly in today's Hollywood and it's one of my all time favorite movie endings and one of the reasons the film is truly brilliant and why I love The Thing. The whole cast does a great job in their roles. Kurt Russell is excellent as R.J MacReady,the man who becomes the leader when things fall apart. A.Wilford Brimley is great as Dr Blair the doctor who goes crazy. Keith David is wonderful as Childs and is tough as nails. Donald Moffat is effective as Garry bringing depth and sympathy to the role. T.K Carter is great as Nauls and brings some humor to the film. Richard Dysart(Dr.Copper),David Clennon(Palmer),Richard Masur(Clark),Charles Hallahan(Norris),Thomas Waites(Windows),Joel Polis(Fuchs)and Peter Maloney(Bennings)give great performances as well.The direction by John Carpenter is brilliant because Carpenter is always moving the camera giving the film a since of dread,eeriness and doom of not knowing what's going to happen or where. Great direction by Carpenter.The score by Ennio Morricone is frightening and scary and matches the dark,grim tone of the film. One of Morricone's best scores.The special effects by Rob Bottin are excellent some of the most ingenious,bloody,gory imaginative effects in film history. Shocking,surprising and unexpected,Bottin's effects set the standard for make-up effects still hold up years later.In final word,John Carpenter's The Thing is a flawless Horror classic that is amazing from beginning to end and is a film that belongs in every Horror fan and movie buffs collection and is John Carpenter's greatest film. Highly Recommended. 10/10.","

"paul_haakonsen","9 June 2018","John Carpenter really did manage to create something unique with this movie. And throughout the many years, this movie has proved again and again that it is more than capable of withstanding the test of time,And while the special effects certainly show their age, they are actually still good when taking into consideration the time in which the movie was made.""The Thing"" is driven by a good storyline, although it seems to have suffered somewhat at the cutting board and certain scenes seem to have been artificially reduced to save time.The movie could have benefitted so well from an extended version release. I am not familiar with any done, but of course there might just be such. They have just eluded my attention.The cast in Carpenter's ""The Thing"" from 1982 was good, and they each brought something unique to the movie.""The Thing"" is a classic by all means, and if you haven't already seen this movie then it is about due time to do so. Especially so if you enjoy a good Lovecraftian inspired horror movie, because this is definitely tainted, pardon my French, by his unique style of cosmic dread.","

"hentschellm","4 April 2007","The ThingI'm going to give the full review using my standard formula. Let's Begin.This is in my opinion the 2nd greatest horror film ever only inferior to Alien. The movie is a loose remake of the horror classic The Thing From Another World. But for those who say all remakes sucks, try and answer to this. This movie is in my opinion superior to the original. The alien is much more unique, and because of this it's a lot scarier. Not to say the original wasn't scary.Plot: The plot is great. 12 men in Antarctica see a Norwegian shooting at a dog. They kill the shooter, and take the dog in. I am just setting you up, I won't get anymore into it than that.Acting: The acting is great. I only recognized two people in this movie, Kurt Russell and Keith Davids. Kurt Russell gave a superb performance as MacReady, a helicopter pilot who must cope with the madness growing in his friends. Everyone gave a great performance in this movie. Using an all male cast everyone gave a convincing performance with fear, anxiety, mental instability, and a loss of trust for best friends.Horror: Like my title says, in my opinion this is the 2nd greatest horror film ever made inferior only to Alien. John Carpenter gives the perfect idea of fear with an alien who takes control of an organism's body and makes a perfect imitation, looking and sounding like the person, remembering the same thing the person or animal remembers, and acting the same way as well. This goes into the scariest part of the movie, the loss of trust between best friends. As the movie goes along you see the former friends attempting to murder, interrogate, and coerce each other. Also the idea of being isolated in Antarctica is the perfect idea for a horror film. The special effects are great. Rob Bottin did an amazing job with this movie. He started by making sketches of things that had never been done before. He did them and made them spectacular. The music was a very underrated part of the movie. Ennio Morricine made a fabulous score which helped make the movie scary like Halloween.In my opinion this even beats out horror classics like Halloween and The Birds. It provided a scary premise with a bit taken from the original and the rest taken from the short story. For big horror fans, see this movie right away. If you are truly a horror fan you will see the genius of this horror film. Even if you're not a big horror fan you will see the genius of this movie.10/10","

"Coventry","28 October 2003","It was about time I watched this movie again. I was 12 when I first saw it and it scared the living hell out of me. Ever since then I'm careful when I see a Hushky...John Carpenter's version of the ""Who Goes There"" story is fascinating, scary and pretty gore at several times but it surely is highly recommended. The creepy atmosphere is unique and very few movies equal to it or even come close. The Thing is some sort of Alien monster that has been safely frozen for the last 100.000 years but now it has thawed. That's the fault of a few Norwegian guys...In the form of a innocent looking dog, the thing ends up in an American Station. This is the greatest power of the enemy. It's fully capable to take over any life form and therefore it's hard to detect. And ... even more importantly ... it doesn't take long before anyone can be trusted. Everyone could in fact be ""The Thing"" This rather simple - but at the same time original and innovative - aspect about the enemy allows the story to create a unique claustrophobic atmosphere. First of all, you have the isolated landscape of the Antarctic Circle. The groups ' space to run and hide is very limited since it's unbearably cold and there are lots of storms. Secondly, the Thing to itself is very unpredictable. The tension between the characters can almost be smelled by the viewer and I think that's Carpenter biggest achievement about this movie. Although, there ain't much dialog in this film , you're kept close to the screen in order not to miss anything. Basically, Carpenter does pretty much the same as in his other horror classic Halloween. Although this is a complete different plot and complete different setting, there's not a message to detect, no psychological undertone or no form of humanity what so ever. Just a raw battle to survive between a bunch of tough men.And last but certainly not least ... some credit for the special effects and make-up department. This crew is just brilliant and pretty explicit for the 80's if you ask me. They managed to visualize a perfectly scary looking creature. Several shocking scenes will haunt your head long after you've seen this movie. Don't matter if you're a hardened horror fan already or not, but the images of a splitting dog and a human head marching on spider legs won't leave you senseless. Excellent Class A horror. Also worth a mention: the subtle but memorable score by Ennio Morricone... Highly recommend to all film-fans, a must see for horror freaks. The original version from 1951 is highly recommended as well. Lovely 50's SciFi-movie, that is !!Favorite ""rewind""-scene : The Doctor desperately tries to save a crew-member and prepares himself to give him a heart-massage. At the moment that his hands touch the guy's chest, it splits open and grabs the doctor with filthy looking teeth ...Enjoy !!","

"Boba_Fett1138","25 January 2009","It had been quite some years since I had last seen this movie and the earlier brilliant and fresh movie version ""The Thing from Another World"" from 1951 was more fresh on my mind. I think I can say that ""The Thing"" is actually even a better movie. It's a great horror with a touch of science-fiction.To put it boldly, this movie is like ""Alien"", only set at the Antarctic. It has the same sort of atmosphere, build up, look and of course a killer alien on the loose. However this is not an ""Alien"" clone. The movie is just too good for that to call it one.I think I can say that this is one of the most paranoid movies ever made. It's actually quite easy to make a good and effective horror movie once you know to create a certain level of paranoia into the movie. In this movie you just never known who the alien is, which makes you very uncertain of things and makes you literally trust no one or his motivations throughout the movie. With this given element the movie knows to build up a great tension and atmosphere for the movie. It's horror elements mostly gets feed from these elements and it's what makes ""The Thing"" such a superior and classic movie within its genre.You really have to give John Carpenter credit for this movie. He has done lots of classic horror movies throughout his career but this one perhaps is his most brilliant one. He builds up the movie extremely well and very effectively. What also helps with this are Ennio Morricone's moody musical score (while normally Carpenter composes the music himself for all of his movies) and the camera-work from later Oscar-nominee Dean Cundey. Why doesn't he do horror movies anymore? Now days he mostly makes bright looking, happy movies, while in the past he did the camera-work for some fine and classic horror flicks, including ""The Fog"" and ""Halloween"", which also got directed by John Carpenter.It's also a quite gory movie to watch. The still at the time very young Rob Bottin did a very good job with all of its make-up effects. Some truly gory and unexpected things are happening throughout this movie, so know what to expect.It also knows to remain a realistic movie throughout, even though it of course doesn't feature a very likely main plot. It's because of its directing handling, acting and its writing that the movie works out that way.The movie doesn't feature many characters and also no big names playing them, except for Kurt Russell of course. This also keeps the movie realistic and keeps all characters on the same level. It helps for the atmosphere of the movie, since you also don't know who is going to die next and where and how. It increases also the overall paranoid feeling of the movie.A brilliant classic atmospheric genre-piece!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"Paragon240","27 August 2022","The Thing might be the greatest horror creature film ever made. In an age where aliens were cute and friendly like E. T., John Carpenter's The Thing depicted a disturbing, grotesque creature of nightmare responsible for some of film's most terrifying body horror. The Thing was so far ahead of its time in horror and effects that it brought the terror into reality. Carpenter's brilliant decision to set the film in the frozen wilderness of Antarctica deepens the isolation and paranoia of every second. The practical effects are unbelievable and so impressive, allowing the actors to interact with the horror and make their performances that much more genuine and frightening. The Thing personifies paranoia as Kurt Russell's MacReady attempts to discover who is alien and who is not, with disgusting and disastrous consequences. Carpenter's The Thing is a gut-wrenching horror masterpiece that deserved so much more acclaim and recognition than it received upon its release.","

"stallone-9","9 March 2008","The tag line says it all.This is indeed scary stuff.This movie is a timeless masterpiece,Kurt Russel's best movie and John Carpenter's best movie too.In my opinion this is scarier than Alien and that means a lot.The atmosphere is creepy-cold,windy Antarctica.This is the perfect setting for this kind of movies.I remember the 1st time I ever watched The Thing.I was with my cousin and we were on the edges of our sits.This is really gross stuff.The make up effects are superb.Even today 26 years later they still look good as ever.Creator Rob Bottin and his team really did an outstanding job.The effects really help make the alien look terrifying.The best part is that this thing can mimic anything organic it touches.That's the best thing about the movie you can't tell who is who.If you want to be scared a lot this is the perfect choice for you.This might be the scariest film of all time.If you're into sci-fi and horror I can't think of a better picture than this-great characters,perfect setting,non stop chills,thrills and horror.","

"VikingBurialService","15 September 2022","The best John Carpenter movie. My favorite movie of all time. A perfect film in all facets.Story/Plot/Pacing: Perfect. The movie starts with a very simple concept (an alien wants to disguise itself as people) which it introduces early. The rest of the plot revolves around the crew trying to distinguish humans from imposters, and destroying the imposters. Carpenter builds suspense and paranoia right from the start, and carries it all the way through to the end.Visuals/Cinematography: Perfect. Some of the best practical special effects in any movie ever. The animatronics used for the different versions of the Thing are gory, visceral, disgusting, and stick to the mind. Combined with the dark, frozen setting of an antarctic research base, it adds to the horror/suspenseful tone.Characters: Perfect. The characters react intelligently to their situation. They don't do things without reason. They're defined by actions early on, and the character personalities fit their role. Great example is Palmer. Early on, he's shown as a lazy, pretty-unlikeable guy. Later on, when he turns out to be a thing, it's not a big deal, because he was unlikeable to start with.Dialogue: Perfect. Concise. Economical. Characters don't monologue. They don't exposition-dump.Theme/Tone: Perfect. Isolation/Paranoia/Suspense/Horror
Score: John Carpenter and Ennio Morricone? Together? Obviously perfect.","

"morrison-dylan-fan","21 July 2019","When DVD's were starting to take off in the late 90's, a close family friend called Guy Morgan told me that he had picked up The Thing DVD a year before he got a player,in order for it to be the first DVD he'd watch. Whilst Guy introduced me and my family to countless other great films over the years,he mentioned that The Thing was still his all-time favourite film.In early March 2019,Guy suddenly passed away at age 46. Wanting to pay a lasting online tribute,I decided that my IMDb reviews 1996-2000 would be reviews of his top films,which led to this 2000th review being of Guy's favourite film.View on the film:Iced out with a new 4K restoration, Arrow present an incredible transfer, where the finely balanced soundtrack and glittering restored image are joined by extensive extras.Proving the third time to be the charm, Kurt Russell reunites with his friend and gives an incredibly subtle, brooding performance, gradually building on MacReady's isolation in withdrawn, back to the wall body language, raging with fear over who is the thing. In the middle of nowhere from anywhere else in the world, the rest of the cast give outstanding performances as the fellow research scientists,with Keith David as the ambiguous Childs and Richard Dysart as the fearful Dr. Copper being two of the highlights of the cast.Being the first ""outside"" composer for the director,and ending up with a ""Razzie"" nomination for his work,Ennio Morricone drills a utterly chilling, low-key score,pressing on the loner state of the team with shards of the score casting cracks across the ice. Continuing to build on the visual themes that run across his work, directing auteur John Carpenter reunites with cinematographer Dean Cundey and masterfully expands on their distinctive dolly shots, in the long, slow wide-shot dollys down corridors with a single figure or shadow haunting the location. Tangling the research scientists in Rob Bottin's spectacular,otherworldly practical monster effects, Carpenter and Cundey continue to build on their themes for contrasting appearances for the outside/inside locations, as the inside horror of a blood red monster and the dripping with tension wide group-shots being stabbed in the merciless outdoors of the low-lighting miles of snow in the wilderness.The first feature film by Carpenter that he did not write himself, the screenplay by Bill (son of Burt) Lancaster impressively continues to expand on Carpenter's theme of ""The Shape"", thanks to not giving the monster any dialogue (or dry exposition),and instead focusing on characters attempt to survive the unrelenting onslaught of The Shape. Not featuring a single woman in the film or in the crew, Lancaster makes this isolation of masculinity one which is fuelled on fear and mistrust, exploding in MacReady holding back from making a true attachment to any of his fellow scientists, leaving him shaking with a nihilistic fear over being left in doubt over if he has confronted all of the thing.","

"kenjha","9 August 2011","An alien with the ability to take the forms of humans and animals infiltrates a scientific outpost in the Antarctic. This big-budget remake of the 1951 film proves that bigger isn't better, marred by poor acting, directing, and script. Carpenter thinks that slimy creatures and graphic mutilations are entertaining, but it's just disgusting. There is no subtlety at work here. This film has parallels to ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (the original) and ""Alien,"" but one of the reasons it falls far short of those landmark sci-fi classics is that there's little build-up of suspense. The characters are one-dimensional. It's all about special effects.","

"justin-fencsak","22 July 2017","This movie still resonates 35 years after it came out. Released during the year of ET and other huge summer classics, it failed to connect with its audience due to its graphic imagery and desolate setting. It was also a remake of a cult movie that was featured in Carpenter's most successful movie, Halloween, during a pivotal scene in that movie. It would find new life on home media during the holiday season and became a cult classic in its own right and ranks among the greatest horror films of all time. The visual effects, soundtrack, acting, and cinematography are top notch. The budget of this was more than his previous films combined!!! I suggest you get the Scream Factory collector's edition, since it has a treasure trove of special features, a restored 2k print of the movie (Arrow video in the UK has a 4k print coming out in the fall) along with a newly mixed 4.1 track from the 70mm Dolby Stereo six track reels, and a reversable slip cover that is common with Shout blurays.","

"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","30 November 2019","The Thing is a classic film and in my opinion without a doubt one of my personal favorite horror monster creature flicks of all time. John Carpenter's best movie in my opinion! Some people don't like this movie I don't know why I love this movie to death! To me it is better than Halloween (1978) that movie get's all the praise but The Thing get's hate from harsh critics and reviewers on IMDb. I don't get the hate because I love this film to death. The Thing is the third ultimate John Carpenter / Kurt Russell collaboration between two working together. One of the best monster horror movies I have ever seen of the 80's. It is in my top 10 favorite horror movies of all time. I Love the great 80s classic horror movies and The Thing, it is a great classic sci fi horror movie by John Carpenter with Prince of Darkness.The Thing is a remake of the 1951 movie The Thing from Another World which this remake to me is much way better, more atmospheric and creepy than the original. Kurt Russell's best performance ever, he looks great and very clear on blu ray in HD with a great cinematography worth getting for any horror fan. I love it, I love this movie to death. The movie begins in Antarctica during winter 1982 in the opening scene we see two Norwegian pilots hunting a sled dog in the helicopter. They land in American research station and Norwegian accidentally throws a grande and blows up his helicopter. Than Norwegian fires with his rifle and shouts at the Americans, they don't undestand what is he saying, later he is killed in self defence by Garry (Donald Moffat). When researchers invevestigate what happened they discover an alien burried under the snow over 100.000 years. The sled dog they bring in the station, turns in to shape-shifting alien that assumes the appearance of the dogs and the group is firing with the rifles at the thing, Childs (Keith David) one of the members torchers the monster with flamethrower. It turns out that there are more shape-shifting aliens out there in the base and they assume appearance of the men. Now group has to fight for their survival. No one trust anyone anymore. They have to figure it who is human and who is not a human and a shape-shifting alien, while The Thing keep killing researchers one by one and wreak havoc terror.I love this movie to death, I love the FX and special effects for the Alien thing. Creature effects were degined by Rob Bottin and Stan Winston was brought in to help complete the effect. It was operated on a raised set with puppeteers working below. Stan Winston worked on Aliens (1986) creature effects and desigen and Leviathan (1989). I love the custom and great effects for the creature it is not dated people who are saying those harsh things about this movie I disagree with them! The effects hold up great nowdays for this movie! Visuals and lighting, the story, the idea are great and they are briliant! This movie is great till its day, I am glad the The Thing get's fanbase. John Carpenter's favorite horror movie of mine from the 80's an end of days on an apocalyptic way. Prince of Darkness is my number one Carpenter movie this is my second favorite one I just love this movie to death, it is amazing!The cast everyone in this movie is great: I love R.J. MacReady played by Russell him self it is my favorite character. It is a bad-ass character. Clark played by Richard Masur I love him because he love dogs, I am a dog lover my self. When MacReady fiers at the dog and kills him Clark shouts NO and he stopps MacReady. He love dogs and I respect him so much. Childs played by Keith David was awesome, he reunited in 1989 with John Carpenter in movie They Live. Windows played by Thomas G. Waites I love Windows he was great. I love Garry played by Donald Moffat with a gun he was excellent. Nauls played by T.K. Carter was great I love the cast evan Norwegian actors are great. Great music score by Ennio Morricone who wrote several music scores for the movie. Carpenter loved his music score.This movie come out three years later after the realese of Alien (1979) and in my opinion The Thing is better than Alien (1979). That movie is overrated but it is a classic and it is great. But just like fans are saying that Alien is a masterpiece, well The Thing deserves to be called a masterpiece too. I love the script for this movie writen by Bill Lancaster. Great dialogue and great lines.This movie belongs with Aliens (1986) that I just love to death I love this two movies and it is one of my personal favorite horror films. The Thing is a classic masterpiece by a horror master John Carpenter. I recommend this movie to any horror fan.","

"DeBBss","31 May 2020","The Thing is regarded to be one of the best horror movies of all time, and I can see why. It has the intensity, the uncertainty, and the atmosphere. I love The Thing as a horror movie so much because it doesn't use the classic jump scare technique to scare it's audience. In fact, The Thing is more intense than actually scary, and in my opinion, it's better that way.The plot is so clever and unique for it's time. The Thing is about an alien who imitates organisms by consuming it. This plot is so perfect for creating an intense and uncertain atmosphere. The screenplay is one of the smartest horror screenplays of all time. The screenplay purposefully focuses on MacReady and no else. By doing this technique, it makes all of the characters suspicious, even MacReady at times. There is one issue with not focusing on all of other the characters; it's very hard to know who's who, but by the third act it narrows down and gets less confusing.One of the most important aspects of a horror movie is its setting. The Thing takes place in Antarctica, which is one of the first horrors to take place in such a setting. The Thing uses Antarctica as a setting not just because it adds in isolation, but it's necessary for the plot. The thing (alien) wants to be frozen for it to live on; so the setting is actually important for the plot, instead of it being added in just because Antarctica is scary.The special effects are masterfully done too. Since The Thing was released in 1982, there has to be practical effects. The Thing uses practical effects in such a smart way that it actually makes it scarier than CGI. The special effects were truly ahead of it's time, and it's really sad that there was only one nomination for the special effects.The Thing was truly ahead of it's time. It's brilliantly filmed, the special are perfect, and the screenplay is smart. The Thing is one of the most intense movies I have ever seen, and maybe one of the scariest. The Thing will go down in history as John Carpenter's best movie and one of the most legendary horrors of all time.","

"sol-kay","4 July 2005","***SPOILERS*** As the film ""The Thing"" opens we see this sled dog trudging through the vast Antarctic wasteland of ice and snow being chased by a helicopter. Opening fire on the dog the Norwegian pilot, Larry J. Franco, seems to be terribly agitated at the dog escaping his rifle fire and then opens up a grenade canister and throws it at the fleeing canine. After what seems like forever the dog reaches the US scientific outpost #31 and as the men stationed there run out to see what's happening the pilot starts shooting and throwing grenades all over the place like a man gone insane. He's then shot and killed by Garry, Donald Moffat, after the crazed pilot earlier ended up accidentally blowing up his helicopter with a loose grenades. Finding a partly burned map of the outpost that the dead pilot came from Dr. Copper, Richard A. Dysart, together with US Army helicopter pilot MacReady, Kurt Russell, fly out to the place only to find it burnt-out with everyone there frozen or burned to death. By MacReady and Dr, Copper taking back one of the dead bodies to be examined they brought,together with the runaway dog that was already taken into in the US encampment,into play one of the most hideous monsters that was ever put into a motion picture. A monster that laid dormant for tens of thousands of years until the Norwegian Antarctic expedition dug it out of the ice and inadvertently released it. A horror that within three years could very will wipe out the entire human race by first replicating and then destroying it. Unlike the original 1951 movie ""The Thing from another World"" the John Carpanter directed films storyline follows very closely the famous 1938 Sci-Fi short story ""Who Goes There"" by John W. Campball that both films were based on. Surviving through the process of replicating itself in it's host body ""The Thing"", after wiping out the Norwegian outpost, turned itself into a sled dog and then ended up getting into the US base #31. At the base ""The Thing"" started to take over the bodies of first the sled dog and then the men stationed there by initially infecting them in order to enter their system. Then, like an unending row of domino's, ""The Thing"" goes from one person to another until ""It"" destroyed every living thing, human animal and plant, on earth. Looking something like a cross between a giant spider and octopus ""The Thing"", when it was in it's natural state, looked like a nightmare that came straight out of hell. But when it infected and took over someone on the base, and hid itself inside the persons body, it acted perfectly normal and human until the opportunity presented itself for ""It"" to strike again. It was only too late that the US military men and scientists at the base-camp began to realize that once ""The Thing"" got into their camp the only way that it could be stopped was for them to destroy everything living that it came in contact with, the entire base-camp with them along with it. Not making the same mistake that the Norwegians did by unknowingly allowing it enter their encampment and then later escape, after wiping them out, and continue it's murderous rampage on earth. With the fires that were started by him and his men, battling ""The Thing"", slowly burning themselves out MacReady and Childs,Keith David, the last two survivors of this inferno wait for the bitter minus 100 degree Antarctic winter to set in and thus put them out of there miseries. Shearing a bottle of R&B whiskey to numb their senses they both sit and wait for the end to come knowing that with their actions they put an end to ""The Thing"" and it's ability to use them to farther it's demonic goal in destroying all of mankind.","

"bscrivener-50810","17 January 2016","The Thing is a 1982 sci-fi horror film directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell as Mack MacReady, a researcher based in Antarctica and our protagonist in the film. Upon its release, The Thing was met with a lot of mixed reviews and overall a negative reception, however over the years has gone on to gain a cult following and a legendary status in the history of sci-fi, horror and cinema as a whole. While The Thing does have its moments, as in the grand special effects of the horrific, repulsive monster itself which still don't look particularly dated by todays standards and the great sense of vulnerability in our characters. It is in these characters that lies the problem. Not one of them is particularly likable or relatable, even Kurt Russell himself. You never get a great sense of caring or hoping for a certain character to make it out alive, rooting for a character just doesn't happen in The Thing. We are also left hanging in the balance by the end of the film with no real climactic epic fight or showdown. The Thing can be tense and generally scary at times, but in reality is a pure gross-out film rather than a well crafted horror. The music however is another strong point which does add to the suspense and the very clever idea of blood samples in the latter part of the film really has us guessing and wondering who is human and who is the monster. While I don't agree the statement that The Thing is one of the greatest horror movies of all time, it does have its tense, pseudo horror moments and shrieking horror soundtrack to build on this. Overall it does feel more of a gross-out, gore-fest with unfortunately unlikeable characters, some rushed scenes and disappointing third act which leaves it feeling incomplete, but with brilliant special effects. 6/10","

"michaelplewa","22 March 2007","This is a note-perfect film, from beginning to end. From the snowy, desolation of the Research Outpost to the gloriously realized special effects, there isn't one moment of misstep in this whole film. Sublime casting and a truly satisfying ending cement this film as one of the greatest ever made.You will be on the edge of your seat during the ""petry dish"" test scene. Giving more away would be too much a spoiler. You did see it parodied on South Park (perhaps) last night, but in the context of this paranoic film, it's the best scene of many outstanding scenes.I've had the pleasure of seeing the 50's original on the big screen. John Carpenter purportedly idolizes Howard Hawks, but he surpasses his hero with this ""remake."" The 1950's version is something special, a time-capsule treasure of Hollywood's yesteryear - Carpenter's The Thing is the essential telling of the story.Enjoy for all the years to come. It will leave you in chills.","

"cosmorados","9 June 2008","It's the antarctic, it's an American research centre and it's f**king cold outside. However, when a rival Norwegian research team turn up shooting at a dog, it looks like they've gone stir crazy and are put down for their own good. However as time progresses it becomes extremely apparent that they were very much in possession of their faculties and were not only fighting for their survival but for the survival of the human race.This is the start of John Carpenter's masterpiece (Rather then Halloween) and the film is made memorable for two things, first the effects, that never cease to amaze and dazzle the viewer in their complex and unending ability to shock, terrify and bemuse. Let's get something right that Spielberg recently had a bone with over the first three Indy films. matte paintings that look good are fine, CGI that looks like a play station game is not. The effects in this film are real, you know you're looking at something real and this makes for a film that is all the more unsettling.Next the acting and the script. In this film we feel the sweat and unpleasant camaraderie that people cooped up in this kind of environment feel. There are uneasy alliances and downright detestation of some people, they're not friends they're colleagues and it shares with Alien the distinction of putting these human relations in perfect transfer to the big screen. The script and acting make the effects real because you believe in how the people are with each other. Its ordinariness makes it real.For those of you who have not seen it watch past the first 30 minutes when you might think you're watching a kitchen sink drama in the Antarctic. Trust me, it's worth the wait.Nuff said Em","

"dilbertsuperman","18 September 2007","I remember peeking into this movie in the movie theatre when I was too young to see it- and seeing the most famous scene right at that moment. I was both shocked and scarred and excited at the same time- this was a movie that had just short circuited me- I had to see the rest of it!And I did- and I have watched it several times since then. I have also watched the interviews with the director etc...Carpenter has made some CRAP films in his day. This is not one of them- and in the interviews he blames short schedules and low budgets for the crappiness of some of his films (not in so many words) and judging by this masterpiece of science fiction horror I think he's onto something. Give John Carpenter enough time and money to do it- and he'll do it right!The Thing is based on a science fiction novel called ""Who Goes There"" and was inspired by Carpenter's repetitive viewing of an earlier film of the same title- but this version is a thousand times better, scarier, and also much more true to the original written story and it also captures such an awesome feeling of isolation and spookiness with the scenery and the camera angles and lighting.What can I say- it's a masterpiece.PLOT: A number of scientists and their support team are out in the arctic doing research- one day a crazy Norwegian shows up wanting to kill a friendly dog. They keep the dog.big mistake. What ensues next is a captivating tale of horror and suspense with special effects that still hold up to today's standards- more than 20 damn years later. I can't praise this film enough. It is a classic for the genre that has already stood the test of time.","

"tavm","12 October 2009","Having just rewatched Howard Hawks' The Thing from Another World, I finally decided to see John Carpenter's The Thing on the HD DVD my dad ordered months ago. In this version, the title alien starts to inhabit many of the dogs and people that are stationed in the Antarctic Circle. Among the crew: R. J. MacReady (Kurt Russell), Nauls (T. K. Carter), Dr. Blair (A. Wilford Brimley without his familiar mustache and glasses), Vance Norris (Charles Hallahan), Garry (Donald Moffat), Clark (Richard Masur), Dr. Cooper (Richard Dysart), and others. I'll stop there and just say how fascinatingly weird and gory this movie is. I mean from the dog scene to yet another creature-coming-out-of-someone's-body sequence, there's plenty of entertaining blood-drenched visual effects courtesy of Rob Bottin and Stan Winston. And the pulsating score of Ennio Morricone is positively riveting. I can't always make sense of the dialogue in Bill Lancaster's screenplay but as long as those monster effects come on, I'm never bored. So on that note, I highly recommend John Carpenter's The Thing.","

"CinemaClown","30 September 2015","A masterpiece of unrelenting terror, nail-biting suspense & persistently looming paranoia, John Carpenter's The Thing is one of the greatest films of its genre(s) that presents its esteemed filmmaker at the apex of his talents for the remarkable simplicity with which Carpenter succeeds in infusing the storyline with a chilling sense of dread, tension & uncertainty right from its opening moments and then effortlessly sustaining those vital horror elements throughout the film's runtime is no mere achievement in itself.Set in Antarctica, the story of The Thing follows the crew of an American research facility whose expedition is interrupted when a couple of seemingly delusional Norwegians barge into their station while pursuing & shooting a dog, and are killed in defence. But when the dog mutates and reveals its true identity, the crew deduces that they are being confronted by a parasitic alien lifeform that assimilates other organisms and in turn imitates them perfectly. With no one really sure of who's human & who's the imitator among them, paranoia develops within the group.Directed by John Carpenter (the mastermind behind Assault on Precinct 13 & Halloween), The Thing is without a doubt my favourite film of his. The plot creates an atmosphere of impending doom right from the beginning as we can sense that something is definitely not right with the dog, and thanks to the minimal but menacing track that accompanies that sequence, the build-up is quick & effective. Bill Lancaster's screenplay deserves a mention too for it retains the mystery from start to finish, keeps the premise unpredictable & although the characters aren't fleshed out that well, they do have an identity.The technical aspects further help in setting the film's desired tone & atmosphere, starting with its isolated set pieces that have this sort of a raw, unrefined feel to it which, in addition to its remote location, cleverly brings the element of claustrophobia into the narrative. Cinematography makes excellent use of its camera for the wisely chosen angles, minimal lighting & slow but fluid movements encapsulate the whole picture with an unsettling vibe which only amplifies as the story progresses. Editing is carried out in a very methodical manner as it allows the suspense to settle in at its own pace and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats throughout its 109 minutes of runtime.The work in the special effects & make-up department might have been groundbreaking during its time of release but it looks a tad dated now and at times, unintentionally funny as well and yet it fits & work in favour of this narrative for the most part. However, the most impressive aspect of The Thing in my opinion is its background score, composed by Ennio Morricone. What's amazing about the soundtrack is that it sounds exactly the way Carpenter himself would've scored it, with simple, synthesised tracks that help enhance the sinister mood of the picture and elevate it to a nerve-wracking level. It's quite possibly the best John Carpenter score that wasn't composed by John Carpenter.Coming to the performances, Kurt Russell spearheads the rest of the cast with a good show and plays the role of the research team's helicopter pilot. The script doesn't delve into the background of its various characters but it does give each one of these scripted people their deserving moment on the screen. There is much similarity to Ridley Scott's Alien as far as its casting goes for each character has a role to play here and even if we don't get to know enough about any of them, their predicament and the situation they find themselves in on the isolated continent is deeply felt. Also, both Russell & the rest of the supporting cast do well with what they're given and deliver truly convincing performances.On an overall scale, The Thing is as suspenseful as any cinema can get. It deserves to be ranked amongst the greatest horror films ever made, has aged amazingly well over the years despite its dated effects and still remains John Carpenter's finest directional effort to date. It may not be scary on a visceral level but its tense ambiance, claustrophobic setting & the omnipresent danger of the unknown can run havoc on the senses plus it leaves enough pieces for viewers to put together once the whole story has concluded. Immortal for its contribution to cinema, absolutely living up to its legacy, and continuing to inspire & influence modern chillers, John Carpenter's magnum opus is one chiller no horror fanatic should miss out on. Strongly recommended.","

"betchaareoffendedeasily","8 March 2018","When I viewed ""The Thing"" for the first time at 16yrs it scared the living daylights out of me, and I had trouble sleeping for days afterwards. However, My 6yr younger brother, watched it a few months later and was not at all scared by it. I don't think there is such a thing as ""scariest movie of all time"", for sure some are scarier than others, but when it comes down to the best scary movies, some will affect more than others because of their inherent content. Some people think John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is terrifying, I didn't find it scary in the least, but it is a very good movie none-the-less. I recommend knowing as little about the thing as possible, and not expecting it to be really scary, just enjoy it for what it is; a well-mace piece of sci-fi horror.I won't say anything about the plot, especially any of it's revelations, it
is best enjoyed going in blind. This is not a fast paced movie, it takes it's time to develop and if that bugs you, don't watch, but it is this slower pace that can make it creep under your skin, the shots are often lingering on the creatures, and we are able to spend a decent amount of time with each of the characters in the film simpler because of it's limited cast and location. The arctic location makes it feel bleak and desolate just by nature, and also gives it a vast sense of hopelessness.I enjoyed many of the characters, from Mcready's crustiness, to Window & Palmer's sarcastic nature, to Blair's intelligence and paranoia, to Rawls incessant music and rollerskating. The characters are all distinct and likeable, even if not all of them are necessarily compelling. This is something that really distinguishes it from most sci-fi and most horror films.The score is always effective and interesting, it is one of the best scores of any movie I can think of, and is integral to the overall success of the film, it is never over bear and always adds to the moods of the moment within the film.The cinematography is beautiful, especially the arctic shots, and there inside shots are well-done, they set the claustrophobic mood right out of the gate, often making the cramped quarters seem even more cramped, even in the larger open areas, even outside, simply because of the below freezing arctic temperatures.If this movie doesn't scare you, hopefully you can at least appreciate the effects in the film. One of the greatest achievements of this film, is the practical effects that pushed the boundaries of those effects to their limit, and with a $10,000,000 budget($33,000,000 today), it has the budget to allow this, unlike most sci-fi/horror films, which have tight budget constraints. The effects are grotesque, but not so much for the sake of being grotesque, but rather by necessity, this is one case where a more is more approach actually works, each grotesque sequence often topping the next. I am always amazing, every single time, by the effects that were achieved, now some 36 years ago.The 2011 ""The Thing"" prequel really proves just why practical effects often work so much better than digital ones, the digital effects often are to fast and jaunty, and over time, tend to look cartoonish; even mediocre practical effects do not suffer from this as much as digital ones. This is exactly why there has been a move back towards practical effects recently, they will almost always look more real. I believe both have their place, but in some movies, they have no place at all, and the original thing proves this, the only place the original thing may have benefited from digital effects, is in the last 20 minutes.We only ever know as much as the characters in the movie know, and that isn't much, so if that bugs you, you probably shouldn't watch this. This is a who-dunnit in a way, and things do not wrap up in a neat package, not at all, why this will drive some crazy, it is one of the best things about the movie, you never have all the answers, and you never will.","

"reb-warrior","24 October 2015","This movie is very suspenseful. A nail biter. It reminded me of the Alien movies: an isolated group of people with little to no outside communications, and little to no way of escaping. All they can do is track the thing(ha). There was a keen sense of very rightful paranoia. As you see, this thing, is a chameleon, and could be anyone or more than one.There's lots of gory grossness, and may even be scary to some people. I mainly found it suspenseful. What's missing, is well, a Ripley. Or any female for that matter. The entire cast is male. Mmmn, I could overlook that, but kept feeling a lack of something, and I think that was it.It has a great little track of a suspenseful sound effect, almost like a heartbeat slowed down and with the pitched changed. All the acting was very good. The ending was a little disappointing. I don't know if they were setting up for a sequel, or the director wanted to leave it mysterious. I would have preferred a more defined ending.I just watched it for the first time, and for 1982, it has held up very well. If you like the Alien movies I think you will definitely like this movie.","

"Darkside-Reviewer","2 May 2019","The Thing is an absolute classic combining body horror with intense thriller to make something that stands out in every aspect.The Idea is that the thing organism absorbs a living organism and copies it perfectly to blend in with its environment and assimilate all other organisms while hiding among them just a single cell from the thing is a creature in itself that will fight to survive if separated from the main body nothing organic is safe.The movie takes place in Antarctica in a small research base where a small crew become infected the trouble is who has been assimilated and who hasn't who can you trust when your eyes can't see the threat.The intense thriller aspect is done very well as knowbody knows who to trust and could transform at a moments notice people become paranoid and violent and fight or flight response kicks in.The body horror and gore effects for the transformations into the creatures is very graphic and detailed made with practical effects that look so real and well made better than any CGI could ever be.The cast is great Kurt Russell is iconic in this movie and the dedication from the actors and crew is amazing.If you haven't seen The thing by some miracle I strongly recommend you watch it even if your not one for horror it's hard not to appreciate a movie so well made and spine chilling.Just a suggestion to anyone who watches the movie on Blu Ray the main menu screen shows small cuts from the movie in flashes and it shows a lot or key moments that spoil the film so if you plan to watch the movie on Blu Ray I suggest making sure your ready before putting the disk in and when the main menu starts pressing play on the movie ASAP as you can use the pop up menu to put the subtitles on and change the language and such without having the movie spoiled for you enjoy it spoiler free.","

"oOoBarracuda","30 January 2017","The Thing, the 1982 film by John Carpenter came highly recommended from several close film sources in which I trust. It is a horror movie, it's directed by a horror master, what's not to love for a fan of the genre. No one was more surprised than me that The Thing couldn't even hold my attention, necessitating 3 viewings before I could complete it. Mental note: if you fall asleep during a movie not once, but twice, it just may not be the film experience for you. I persevered, however, because I truly thought I would appreciate the film. The film stars Carpenter's most often collaborator, Kurt Russell as a researcher stationed in Antarctica that is suddenly impacted by an alien life form. A seemingly engaging premise left a lackadaisical impression and further left me with the idea that I may not like John Carpenter as much as I thought I did. During the first ****amn week of winter, a team of American explorers in Antarctica are shocked to find their base being swarmed by a Norwegian helicopter from a nearby base. When the helicopter crashes, the American team goes to investigate only to discover everyone at the base dead or missing. The team does find something of interest, however, when they happen upon the burned remains of an unidentified creature. The team gathers the charred remains, and take it to the base with them where they deduce that it is an alien life form. The most shocking aspect of the remains are that the creature can assimilate into any lifeform it inhabits, and it inhabits like a virus, easily spreading to person to person. The implications of this discovery mean that any member of the team may be inhabited by The Thing, creating tension between the group as they each struggle to distinguish between the unaffected members and the ones The Thing has taken over.I don't even know where to start here. I'm not typically a science fiction fan, and this film had a much more sci-fi than horror feel to it. As far as Carpenter's other work goes, I've only seen Halloween and Big Trouble in Little China, hardly enough examples to lay blame with the director. The narrative seemed to rely largely on an ominous feeling that was never properly established. Maybe my main qualm lies with the poor title. I do know that this film is a remake, I have never seen the 1951 original, but in Carpenter's film, I never knew what I was supposed to be scared of. A shapeshifting organelle that inhabits its host without them knowing is a good premise for a fearful mood, but it never materialized as such for me. There seemed to be several opportunities for more (or better) scares that were not seized upon. I'm so disheartened to learn that the directors I thought I enjoyed were really just responsible for one or two films that I enjoyed rather than the director himself. Wes Craven immediately comes to mind as I have now seen a few of his films, none of which replicating the magic of the original A Nightmare on Elm Street, for me. Of course, I must see more of Carpenter's work before writing him off, but The Thing isn't the film to convince me to put any of his films at the top of my watchlist.","

I now watch it regularly and I still marvel at the brilliant effects and the amazing acting from every single actor, especially Kurt Russell who happens to be my favourite actor.
I don't think I've seen a film with such tension and atmosphere, this film does it perfectly and then some, it's just phenomenal.
This will always be my favourite horror, nothing will ever take its place and I don't think it will ever lose its appeal and cult following.Fantastic.","

"Theo Robertson","14 June 2002","I was round about 15 when I heard about THE THING. A couple of trailers were shown on television promoting the cinema release . A few months later friends started discussing it in class ( They had seen it on pirate video . Obviously I will not condone this but it was very very common to watch pirate videos in the early 80s because that was the only way you`d get see the latest Hollywood blockbusters in those days ) So as soon as I could get my hands on a legal rental  copy of THE THING I did so , mainly due to people saying things like "" Watch THE THING Theo . The special effects are brilliant "" and I was very very disappointed with it. Not only that but I became educated to the fact that good special effects usually = bad film .Over the years however THE THING has grown on me slightly . It`s a scary disturbing film but one that is ultimately destroyed by its characterisation and plot holes . For example why should we feel sorry for people who are totally unsympathetic in anyway ? I was under the impression that when writing a script you are to feel for the characters in it . I felt absolutely nothing for the men in the base in the Antartic , though maybe I`m doing Bill Lancaster a great disservice and the characters are written in such a cold way to match their surroundings . But the script suffers from several plot holes , the most obvious one being the fact that a research base in the South Pole comes equipped by endless supplies of explosives , guns and flamethrowers . What may I ask do you need all that for ? Is that in case you get attacked by a gang of vicious penguins ? And there`s a ( *****POSSIBLE SPOILER*****)  credibility defying scene in which the base members - who have all been proven not to be infected by the alien -  all split up for no other reason except to have an ambiguous ending where one of them might be infected by the alien after all . If they`d all stuck together the alien would have been unambiguously killed.THE THING does have its good points, though not very many. Best plus point is the special effects. If it`d been made 10 or 15 years later it would have been CGI dominated. I think CGI is a pretty poor and unconvincing effect and I`m sick and tired of seeing it constantly used in movies , the effects in this are much better than what we have been used to recently.  This is an extremely dark bleak film , perhaps too dark and bleak which caused its disappointing box office sales, and lets not forget it was released at exactly the same time as ET. I`m a big DOCTOR WHO fan so I expect aliens to be nasty scumbags  who have got a really nasty streak towards the human race , I don`t expect to see them befriend middle American children or fly around on bicycles , but that`s what aliens did in the 1980s , so I guess that THE THING was the last "" they`re coming to get us "" sci fi movie to come out of Hollywood for a while","

"ma-cortes","4 January 2012","The Thing (1982) deals with a lonely group (Kurt Russell , Charles Hallahan , Donald Moffat , Wilford Brimley , Richard Dysart , Richard Masur, T. K. Carter, David Clennon) of scientists who discover bizarre events , as the research bunch are menaced by a shape-changing . Antarctica: an extraordinary continent of awesome beauty . It is also home to an isolated outpost where a discovery full of scientific possibility becomes a mission of survival when an alien from outer space is unearthed by a crew of international scientists. The shape-shifting creature, accidentally unleashed at this marooned colony, has the ability to turn itself into a perfect replica of any living being . It can look just like you or me, but inside, it remains inhuman. In this thriller The Thing , paranoia spreads like an epidemic among a group of researchers as they're infected, one by one, by a mystery from another planet. But it is about to wake up. When an alien frees from its frozen prison , the protagonist (Kurt Russell) must avoid it from killing them off one by one at a time . And in this vast , intense land, a parasite that can mimic anything it touches will pit human against human as it tries to survive and flourish.One of the great Sci-Fi classics , the gradual built-up suspense is quite superb as when the monster is shown largely to create a real menace¨. Monster movie in which an alien menaces an isolated scientific community , that looks and feels just like a stunning remake . This exciting film packs chills , thrills , guessing , paranoia , absence of all characterisation , spectacular FX , including a loathing chest-burning scene . It takes a liberal stand in exposing the tension of men when confronted with a weird being . Based on the novel by John Campbell , the screen-writer Bill Lancaster rejects out the hand the idea that the alien might be worth attempting to understand or communicate with research team . It contains thrilling and intriguing musical score by the great maestro Ennio Morricone . As well as colorful and appropriate cinematography by Dean Cundey . ¨The thing¨ produced by Larry Franco emerges as distinctly Carpenter movie and one might be recommending for its FX , masterfully made by Rob Bottin . B-Film or not , though it's still a masterpiece .The earlier first version results to be ¨The Thing from another world¨ by Christian Nyby and Howard Hawks with Kenneth Tobey , Margaret Sheridan and James Arness as the monster ; it holds a subtle but efficient intrigue . The modern version is The Thing (2011) by Mattijs Heijmingen with Eic Olsen , Ulrich Thomsen , it serves as a prelude to John Carpenter's classic 1982 film of the same name in which a Paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has traveled to the desolate region for the expedition of her lifetime. Joining a Norwegian scientific team that has stumbled across an extraterrestrial ship buried in the ice, she discovers an organism that seems to have died in the crash eons ago.","

"geminiredblue","17 December 2013","If the tag-line for ALIEN was ""In space no one can hear you scream"", then THE THING might have a tag-line that read: ""In Antarctica, no one can hear you scream."" Originally, The Thing started life as a novella called WHO GOES THERE? by John W. Campbell. In 1951, Howard Hawks made a loosely-based version called THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD. It became a classic, bridging the gap between sci-fi and horror, displaying a cast of witty and smart characters and an infuriatingly tough alien. Then in the early 80s, John Carpenter and his crew set out to remake THE THING. Many viewers who had seen the earlier film were put off by it, remarking on the graphic content. What many viewers may not have known is that John Carpenter's version is much closer to the source material. Having read the book, I must admit it was quite original. Now the story: In Antarctica, a US scientific team take in a dog that's running from a couple of Norwegians. However, nothing is as it seems... Not wanting to reveal too many details, let's just say The Thing appears and terrorizes the team. Many of the graphic deaths and mutations remain intact from the book, as well as the claustrophobic locations and growing sense of dread and suspicion. Kurt Russell (a John Carpenter regular) plays the role of R.J. MacReady perfectly, as do the rest of the cast (many of whom are veteran actors). The dripping, nauseating special effects are some of the creepiest ever filmed. And mercifully, Carpenter allows the film to retain the book's terrifying, downbeat ending. For you, the gentle bloodthirsty viewer, there's a little something for everyone to find scary in this one. So make this required viewing, and if you're an avid reader, hunt down WHO GOES THERE? It's equally as strong!!!","

"tiagocampos-02918","31 January 2019","The Thing truly is the ultimate in horror. The special effects are perfect, the best I've ever seen! It's a movie that scares you with little to no jumpscares because it presents you with superb visual effects that will make you look away at the horrific mutated monsters, the chilling and claustrophobic environment and the uneasy feeling of distrust regarding all characters in the picture. You never know who's human and who's pretending to be human and you never know what is lurking inside, what the infection is, where it is, what it is doing when it might be right in front of you, etc. It's right there, haunting and destroying you but you can't see it, feel it, hear it, touch it. The mystery is frightening and the tension is palpable! Do yourself a favour and watch this movie! The mastery of it outshines everything that might be a little less perfect. Best horror movie ever made!","

"christopher-underwood","19 May 2020","This is really quite splendid and it is evident watching it once more, this time on Blu-ray, that it will easily bear multiple viewings. What happens and the order that it happens in matters less than the whole believability of the situation and the grittiness. This may not look like the kind of crew you might expect to find at an American research station at the North Pole, but they are a likeable bunch. The dialogue is good, with the rapport and humour in abundance, despite or because of the pending doom. Then there are the special effects, different every time and mind boggling and the degree to which we buy into these transformations figures heavily when the guys partake in the blood testing. A fantastic and central sequence where we believe nobody knows whether they are possessed or not and feel their individual fear as the Russian roulette type ritual is undergone. Full credit, of course to Carpenter and the young effects man but here Kurt Russell really gives his all and helps make this such a convincing and marvellously horrible experience.","

"FeastMode","7 July 2020","This movie had some of the best practical effects i've seen. they were legit terrifying every time. and that's the only thing i liked about this movie.everything else was really boring with very little suspense or creepiness. it's filled with OMA (old movie attributes) like unnecessarily long shots of nothing, like 18 seconds of watching a helicopter flying, no change in angles or anything, just 18 FULL SECONDS of a helicopter flying in one direction. or three other scenes of a helicopter landing, very slowly, all the way until it touches the ground. why? i think the director has a helicopter fetishthis movie is also REALLY dumb. i could make fun of a thousand things. (mild spoilers) like why the one guy had to tell macready this secret outside away from everyone, why not just tell everyone, since it was vitally important to know. or how a doctor thinks it's perfectly natural to just pull out human organs, since you know, they're just floating around inside us, not attached to anything. or a magical computer that answers questions it's never encountered before and has no programming for, complete with unprogrammed animations. or how they magically know that mixing fake blood with real blood will cause a reaction.i can't take this kind of stuff. OMA is a heavy factor in my negative opinion on most old movie ""classics."" this movie also lacked any entertainment value or suspense. characters depth, good dialogue and an intriguing plot were missing. but in 1982, people didn't really care (1 viewing, 7/6/2020)","

"strong-122-478885","16 May 2014","I rate this Sci-Fi/Alien Invasion movie 5 stars solely on the merits of its gooey, fantastically over-the-top monster-effects that were artfully created by brilliant effects-wizard, Rob Bottin.Man, Bottin really outdid himself this time with some of the most wild and grotesquely imaginative alien assimilation sequences ever seen in a pre-CGI horror picture. The awesome ""blood test"" scene was the absolute best of all.This movie only comes to life when Bottin's excellent handiwork is the focus of the action. Without his cool creations The Thing, under John Carpenter's lame direction, just sucked.It would be an understatement to say that this picture has lost a lot of its initial clout over the past 35 years.As well, none of the characters were at all likable, especially Kurt Russell's MacReady, who was nothing but a suck, a drunk, and a sore-loser who couldn't stand to be beaten in a game of chess by his computer-opponent.I thought that this film's opening sequence with the Norwegians (flying in a helicopter) repeatedly attempting to shoot down an escaped husky and missing their target every time (even though the dog was an easy target), was one of the most pathetic ""hot pursuit"" scenes ever captured in a big-budget horror movie.Boo! Hiss! to John Carpenter for dishing up this kind of crap.","

"martinlucas-469-207968","12 April 2019","As most of the reviewers for this film will agree, this is a genuinely gripping story from start to finish, as well as being a horror classic. But it's also an important milestone for two reasons.
First it was one of the very first horror films to actually give you in detail, a really good look at the various monstrous expressions of the key villain. Up to that time most horrors were implied and as soon as you saw the the rather dodgy special effects representing the actual monster, the illusion started to fade.
Secondly, despite this challenge, absolutely no CGI or anything like it was used. Computer graphics in those days were so primitive that it took the makers several days to create a simple computer screen showing the cells of the monster transforming into those of a host. Instead the special effects team took a delirious joy in dreaming up ingenious ways to show various horrors using simple techniques like reversing the film, the use of plentiful amounts of plasticine, string and goo, and stop motion photography.
Lastly there was brilliant use of a trained Alsatian dog. The strange stillness and focus of its gaze before it's finally revealed that it has been invaded by the alien sends a chill down the back and was completely convincing.
Watch and enjoy!","

"Jacques98","18 October 2008","Let me get this out of the way: I am not a biased fan of this movie. I did not grow up with it, I did not see it once, get scared, and then love it when I was older, and I did not watch it with any hype or weighted opinion whatsoever. I'm not really a John Carpenter fan. I am a hardcore horror fan who has seen the majority of what the genre has to offer. I am an adult, and I watched this last night, 9/17/08. I'm not sure it's possible to find an opinion that is more unbiased than mine when I say: The Thing rocked.First and foremost, the reason The Thing works is because it does not bash your over the head with a block of cheese, unlike most ""classic"" horror movies. Some of the effects are a bit outdated, despite what the lifetime fans would have you believe, but not so much as to look cheesy. At all. There is very little gorenothing that the average parent wouldn't let a 8-year-old seeand the gore effects are also outdated, but it doesn't take away from the movie. I just found it downright refreshing to watch a movie that didn't try to kick me in the balls. I've watched so many ultra-gory movies lately, The Thing made me remember what it was like when movies didn't use gore to make the viewer feel like crap, but instead used gore as part of the actual story. It's the perfect movie to watch on a snowy night with your girlfriend/wife or your kids.The reason The Thing isn't cheesy is because it submerges you in atmosphere and suspense and mystery, then it punches you. The creatures are not generic whatsoever, and some of them are downright weirdly awesome. (Spider-head, anyone?) The plot is pretty generic, if you can even call it a plot at all. Here is one of the greatest movies of all time, and it does something that you wouldn't expect: it doesn't really have a plot. No, The Thing is true survival horror. There is nothing here except the desire to survive, and that is the only plot. The opening scene hints that the creatures are aliens, but, really, the movie never says much about their origins other than that. Watching this movie is almost like watching people in an arena try to surviveyou don't watch it for the story. What makes The Thing original and different from the other movies like it is the small details, like setting, the creature designs, the characters, the ending, and so on.People who get bored with this movie don't understand suspense. I can understand that, because in the generation that we live in, suspense is dead and buried. Suspense has been replaced with either (1) lame action, or (2) lame dialogue scenes that ""build characters"", even though the characters are pure clichés. Suspense is the feeling of ""I know everyone is going to die . . ."" that you get before anything happens. I can count the amount of movies that get suspense right on one hand, but The Thing honestly pulls it off. If you're a fan of suspense moviesand no, I don't mean Wolf Creek, I mean like AlienI do not know why you haven't seen this movie already.Then there is one more thing I need to mention: The Thing isn't Alien. It never will be Alien. It is not quite as good as Alien, though it has more action. It is, however, the only movie I would ever mention in the same breath as Alien, because it does come very, very close.Overall: This is by far the best Carpenter movie I've seen, and one of the few movies I've ever seen that understands suspense. It's easily one of the best horror movies of all time, and I'm saying that as someone who find most ""classic"" horror movies pure cheese. Watch this movie. Watch it now.9/10","

"nickenchuggets","31 July 2021","Some time ago, I wrote about The Thing From Another World, a classic 50s sci-fi movie that focuses on an almost unkillable alien creature rampaging through a base in the arctic and causing destruction. John Carpenter, being the avid fan of horror he is, was probably a big fan of that movie and wanted to reinvent it in a newer style for modern audiences. The movie bears a lot of similarities with its predecessor, the most distinctive being the similar setting. However, the 50s film takes place at the north pole, while this takes place in Antarctica. They both involve tons of snow and frigid temperatures so it can be easy to forget which is which. Despite essentially being an unofficial followup to the 50s movie, The Thing's plot is drastically different in many ways. It begins with a vehicle that was around during the filming of the original, but was not featured: a helicopter. One belonging to a team of Norwegian explorers to be specific. They are flying near the south pole and chasing some kind of dog with the flying machine, which leads them to an american base. After landing, the norwegian helicopter blows up and everyone onboard is killed. An american named MacReady (Kurt Russell) is stationed at the base and takes a helicopter ride of his own to the base the norwegians were a part of, only to find a strange creature that appears to be dead. MacReady takes it back to base for study, and Blair, a doctor, finds perfectly healthy organs inside of it. Meanwhile, the dog the helicopter was chasing earlier gets locked up with some other ones, when all of a sudden it transforms into a grotesque, gory mess of tentacles and bones. The researchers manage to fend it off with a flamethrower, and shortly after, learn about a buried alien spaceship. Things get worse when the alien starts to kill personnel all around the base and prevents it from being reinforced. It also becomes apparent the alien has the ability to steal the appearance of any one of the team members, meaning nobody can be trusted. The alien continues to infect and kill the remaining members of the base, and MacReady is forced to lay explosive charges all around the area in a last ditch attempt to get rid of the creature. Blair is killed and his body is taken over by the alien, who uses it to attack MacReady. Nevertheless, the base explodes anyway, and MacReady (alongside Childs, the only other survivor) grab a beer. When it was released back in 1982, this movie was so hated and misunderstood that it was called ""instant junk."" The thing is (no pun intended), this probably came about because of bad timing. E. T. Was released the same year, and also featured an alien. The difference is that it had a much more lighthearted mood and was easier and less violent to watch. Interestingly, the theme for this movie was done by Ennio Morricone, which was unexpected. The special effects in this movie are what really steal the show, since they're quite disturbing, especially when the alien is able to steal people's bodies and make all their skin peel off. During its release, lots of people hated this movie because of how graphic it is, and also because of its cynical attitude of not being able to trust anyone, since after all, they might be the alien. John Carpenter said he was greatly upset when he heard people at the time hated this movie, saying how ""he takes every failure hard."" Many of his movies, like Halloween, also have this gory, slasher feel to them, and this contrasted deeply with Spielberg's ET. Still, more recent reviews have been more positive, citing that the movie didn't get admiration when it came out and thus deserves some now. The synthesizer music is really creepy, and the thought of being stuck in -70 degree weather where nobody can help you is pretty disturbing. When compared with the 50s original, I feel that The Thing is an inferior but still worthy remake. The original set the standard and had a different monster, one that was visible to all the members of the base. This one can be anywhere at any time. I still think it's odd how a remake ended up more popular than the original, because without that movie, this one wouldn't exist.","

"robsta23","24 February 2015","I was very surprised by what this film achieved. I went in with low expectations even though it had a spot on IMDb's 250; man was I wrong.From the start of the film we are immediately asking questions for which we want answers. Is that helicopter crew shooting at the dog? What are they afraid of? Why did they attempt to destroy the American base in Antarctica? When these questions are answered, we ask the more important question: which of these men have been infected by the titular ""thing?""Such a simple premise, yet so powerful to get our hearts racing and question humanity. Blair may seem mad, but he is very rational trying to destroy transportation so the thing cannot reach the world outside of Antarctica. What I love is that saving humanity is an implied motivation for various characters within the film, but it is hardly stated by any of the characters.This movie is a thrill ride, science fiction film with a concept not unlike ""And Then There Were None."" One thing bothered me in this film: remember how I said Blair is rational? This is due to a lazy bit of writing, in which a computer states before the camera that humanity could be wiped out in a short amount of time due to this thing, and this is based on a few seconds of analysis by the computer. I just found it cheesy.The conclusion of the film had me in awe, questioning humanity while the two survivors simply wait for a sign that either of them are a double until they ultimately perish.","

"bsinc","6 August 2003","Carpenter actually managed to make his ""The Thing"" far inferior to its predecessor , the 1951 ""The Thing From Another World"". If you have read my comment on the latter you may know what I'm talking about, but the fact remains that you cannot make this sort of movie based purely on some cheesy monster, it has to be character driven first; that's why ""Predator"", the whole ""Alien"" franchise and some other monster movies work. And what does ""The Thing"" have to offer; well not much; Kurt Russel is his hillbilly self, taking the leader role from the very start and the rest of the cast doesn't amount to much either. The best part of the whole movie is the opener which really got me thinking and hoping what Carpenter had in store, but it just proved to be a disappointment. The movie also excluded some of the best scenes from the original, like showing  the discovery of the space ship. The 1951 movie made that scene very thrilling, showing less than more, making the viewer yearn for a glimpse but never getting one. And don't get me started on the monsters; the comments I read from the IMDb users make you want to think the effects are better and scarier than anything you've ever seen, but the honest to God truth is I'd choose even the original creature from ""Alien"" any day. There are just so many things popping and bursting out of those creatures it's hard to swallow, and the head-turn-to-spider scene is a real gem when it comes to idiotic comedy. Plus it shows just how much the special effects creators were influenced by ""Alien"" which came out only a couple of years ago; the thing even lived off of the same thing, it needed a host and then it just ate whatever it could find. There were even similarities with the whole blood scene; alien's was acid, this one just lived forever and didn't like fire. I thought Morricone's score was quite good, the whole 5 minutes of it which I'm guessing is one of the reasons it got a Razzie nomination. Ha. Overall, a movie that doesn't pay much tribute to the original, nor does it manage to surpass it, not by a long shot. Not enough atmosphere, a poor script and a bad climax don't amount to much and probably the most inventive and positive thing in this whole mess is the very ending, which reminds us ""The Thing"" is definitely a Carpenter movie, sadly just not one of the better ones. 5/10","

"Kanadiz","16 September 2009","It's not so often I encounter the chance to revisit a classic on the big screen yet yesterday I had that privilege to watch John Carpenter's cult horror classic 'The Thing' at the Cineworld Cinema near Piccadilly Circus. The film begins in the midst of the Antarctic snowfield where a helicopter is circling an American research base chasing down a husky with a sniper. When the helicopter crashes and the pilot is killed, the passenger survives only to continue his mission of pursuing and killing the dog and in the process shots one of the members of the research team to get to the dog. The gunman who appears to be Norwegian is shot down by the captain of the base as he obviously appears to be steered crazy and incredibly dangerous.When they eventually find out that this dog isn't what it appears to be, two members of the team, one being MacReady (played by Kurt Russel who gives a fine performance here), goes on a search for the Norwegian base to see what clues they can find. When they do find the abandoned base, they find a large block of ice which looks as if something had been frozen in it for centuries and a half burnt corps that looks like something they've never seen. Of course this corps is brought back to the base, and after a few autopsies are made, one of the doctors makes the shocking discovery of a creature that imitates cells When one of the members of the base is left alone with the remains of the creature, another team member enters the room only to discover the creature is not dead and is now in fact imitating a member of the team. When help comes forth, the creature has almost finished the process and looks exactly like the team member except for a few last features. This is where the tension really begins; paranoia hits everyone and hits them hard. Did they kill the creature? Are there any remains of the creature left? If so, has it taken shape of any other team members? Who is human and who is the creature? Who can they trust? You can even feel the tension in the atmosphere of the base, the silence, the darkness, and the reactions of the team members when they suspect another team member.If one person gets out of their sight for an instant then that person is automatically a suspect. The best example of paranoia is shown by Dr. Blair played by Wilford Brimley who delivers the best performance in the film. He discovers that if this creature reaches civilization, it will eventually imitate mankind little by little and this drives him over the edge and wants no one from the base to escape for the sake of mankind. I felt quite fortunate as to have previously visited Howard Hawk's original Sci-Fi classic 'The Thing from Another World' which is quite an impressive film especially for 1951, did not feature a shape-shifting creature, instead it featured a gigantic creature that required human blood in order to reproduce. The director John Carpenter, being a fan of Howard Hawks did not try to copy the original; instead he went back to the original novel 'Who Goes There?' by John W. Campbell Jr. from 1939 which did feature a shape-shifting creature, thus making the film more tense and more suspenseful.John Carpenter has never been known for his character build up; in fact the villains in his movies are usually mindless and lack emotion or personality as shown in this film and many others such as Michael Myers in his merciless masterpiece 'Halloween', the car Christine in 'Christine' or the zombie-like ghosts from 'The Fog'. But he is famous for his tense scenes and his dark and creepy shots as hardly any of his movies contain more than ten minutes of daylight. This is a well paced, well shot film and with these sorts of movies, that's rare.Watching 'The Thing' again I couldn't help but be reminded of Don Siegel's Sci-Fi classic 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' from 1956, where a doctor in a small town practise finds numerous patients of his claiming that their relatives or close friends are not who they seem to be but in fact impostors who look exactly them. These two films feature the same sort of paranoia, only John Carpenter makes the decision of showing the shape-shifting commence by using extremely grotesque and gory special effects. Although I am not a fan of grotesque special effects, especially as over blown as they are here, John Carpenter's version of 'The Thing' still succeeds as a haunting tale of paranoia and is a highly entertaining and action packed sci-fi film that is sure to entertain even if it's not as great as Don Siegel's classic.Upon the film's release back in 1982, the film did not do so well in the box office, maybe because it came out only two weeks after the phenomenon 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' or maybe it's simply due to its extensive use gore and violence which it earned it an ""R"" rating by the Motion Picture Association of America. It instead went on to become a cult favourite and is now considered to be one of the best and scariest horror films ever made.","

"cherold","4 September 2013","The Thing has an interesting start as a man makes a determined effort to kill a dog. It's a disquieting scene, creating a sense of mystery. The movie continues its sense of disquiet for a while, letting you worry without quite knowing why.Unfortunately, after that the movie becomes focused on special effects and explosions. The characters are generic, the story is a little muddled, and some of the most effective scenes are also the least realistic. For me, the most interesting thing about the movie was how much Kurt Russel looked like someone from the band the Bee Gees. I always think of his as Snake Pliskin, but here, in spite of an authoritative role and bushy beard, his baby face and blow-dried hair make him look like a Hollywood actor pretending to be a tough guy. I wish they'd made him a little scragglier. To be fair. I didn't care much for the original movie from the 1950s either. So perhaps this is just not the story for me.","

"theinaniloquent","7 May 2012","Long story short: I had large expectations for this film. It's been coined one of the scariest films of all time. The Shining and Exorcist are also coined the same thing, which are actually scary. It had a great plot. I loved the whole mystery thing it had going on, not knowing what 'it' is. And it was made by John Carpenter. He's the director who has created the iconic character of Michael Myers and made the classic horror film. So with all these added up, I was really excited to see what was to come. It had all these things that had it coming, but here's the biggest shocker: it was horrible. The Thing has all the components of a horror film, and the strangest thing is that it uses them, but for what reason? So the beginning was done fantastic. My expectations were huge, kept me wondering what this film could do. Ready to be scared off my seat. But maybe my expectations were too high.. Carpenter thinks he can create an eerie feeling throughout the entire thing, which he's half right/half wrong. The sense of paranoia IS there, but it just dies down every time something happens. Carpenter also takes the gimmicky effect of gore itself, and uses it to make these far-fetched images, that he thinks will scare us, but then comes off a bit silly. One scene was this guys turn into some crawling creature, which way back in 1982 would surely look stupid. And it does. And Carpenter's vision of aliens itself are just absurd. I imagine aliens as short, green fellows with one eye and a laser gun; the stereotypical vision of them. Carpenter thinks they are shape-shifting guys that we never get to see. And that's the problem with me. Carpenter uses the gimmick to not show the aliens, which sort of comes of as a mixture of stupid and curiosity, but for me? I sat in half-confusion, half-bored. There was no sense of tension between the characters, and the slow-burn pacing never helped either. So I wouldn't recommend The Thing. It's cracked up to be one of the greatest horror films of all time, but it never ever shows this. It's was boring, slow, pointless, and tension-less. It's not even one of those horror films that you want to watch with your friends, because all you would be doing is watching the gross-out scenes that seamlessly go nowhere. If you loved Halloween, and hate the gimmicky effect of gore, The Thing will be hated by you. If you hate Halloween, love gore, love horror movies that come out today, then this is your sort of film. I didn't like it, my opinion, my fact. The end.4/10.","

"bheadher","21 July 2019","The use of eerie music and visuals is superb; John Carpenter had a clear vision of what he wanted to create...while this version only touches on the original's plot, it does so to actually enhance the story. CGI was only a glint in someones eye at the time, and if you blink you miss the fact that they used no CGI at all.Yes, this is definitely a masterpiece of the highest order, and reminds the viewer that the very best horror movies are all in the presentation; both visually and psychologically","

"lindahl-klas","2 January 2008","The Thing is in my humble opinion maybe the greatest of all of Carpenter's films. It's great on so many levels, I'm having trouble deciding what I will start with.All right, first of all, the story is great. We follow a group of researchers, on expedition in Antarctica, far away from civilization. The thought of being helpless in freezing cold conditions without the chance of getting any help is disturbing enough. And as an extra layer of complexity, we have the paranoia and mind-bending element of who-can-I-trust?. Since the group is faced with a never-before seen threat that spreads like a virus no-one knows what to do or who to trust. And the longer times go, and the more of the crew gets tainted by the alien, the more the paranoia grows. I think essentially why I love this movie so much is because I always try and imagine myself in their situation. Would I panic? Would I turn into MacReady or would I become ""the thing""? I get goose bumps just thinking about it.The score, for once not made by John Carpenter, is really really good. We usually hear Ennio Morricone's music in western movies, but he has done a tremendous job with the music to The Thing. Since the music is so essential to the feeling of a certain film, the composer has a crucial task upon him. Morricone made it with brilliance and finesse, and the mood of the picture hits you right at the first credits. Awesome!So the special effects might not be comparable with todays CGI technology. That doesn't matter, really, in my opinion. It's not only the realism in monsters that decide how good the scares are in all horror movies. Really good horror movies can always depend on the mood setting, the story and the (un)expectation from the viewer. And those things are all as good as they can be in The Thing. Also, the effects aren't bad to begin with, I just wanted to prove a point.The ending is fantastic. MacReady does the right thing, and ends the film being a hero. He knew his life (or any other's) couldn't be saved, but instead of crawling into a corner and cry like a little baby he did the only right thing. He went out and put an end to the whole thing by blowing up the place, leaving nothing but the bister winter to keep him company (and Childs who cared to show up some explosions too late). When the end credits roll I'm really impressed by this movie. It has me captured frame-by-frame all through the runtime every time I see it. The Thing undoubtedly has an important quality -- it makes you think and it makes you involved, and it makes you want to watch compellingly all the way to the end.","

"gbill-74877","3 January 2019","An intelligent and reasonably tight story set in a research outpost in Antarctica, where scientists have inadvertently dug up some form of parasitic, shapeshifting alien out of the ice. It quickly becomes a study in paranoia, where behavior amongst the men becomes a game as difficult as that chess match against the computer Kurt Russell has early on: if one of your colleagues may not be what he seems to be, what's the best move? Attempting to determine who it might be, and selectively isolating him? Destroying everyone so that you might survive? Attempting to use reason and science in a helter skelter, chaotic situation? I loved the setting and the very cool ways in which the thing manifests itself, which at the time seemed so excessive that it turned reviewers off, but which today appears highly creative and refreshing in light of modern CGI, at least for me. There may be a couple of moments when one wonders about character motivations and it's a pretty simple story, but the latter keeps it focused, and the pace of the film is good. Kurt Russell and Keith David stand out in the cast, which also includes A. Wilford Brimley and Donald Moffat.","

"aidanratesmovies","16 October 2021","My favorite horror movie of all time, an entertaining masterpiece with Carpenter at the top of his game- The Thing is by far the best remake of any film ever made and is easily some of the best work I have ever seen on screen to this day. From its insane all-out practical effects to Russell's stellar performance, there is absolutely nothing to not love about this film. The cinematography is incredible, and the setting provides a perfect background for the claustrophobic events that happen on screen. Kurt Russell is fantastic as always as the films obvious standout, as well as the rest of the stellar supporting cast- especially Keith David. The special effects are glorious and a pure example of why many Horror films lack the scares and timelessness that films like this do- and honestly prove to hold up better than the already dated CGI effects from the 2011 version. As I said before, Carpenter and Producer Debra Hill are at the top of their game in this one and are able to craft a story that is not only endlessly fun to watch and see unfold but endlessly suspenseful and emotional to watch as well. In my book, it's the best horror film ever made, and I honestly could never get tired of watching it.My Rating: 10/10.","

"moonspinner55","23 March 2009","John Carpenter's nightmarish variation on the well-regarded 1951 chiller ""The Thing From Another World"" features a colorless cast of macho dullards led by Kurt Russell who tangle with unseen enemy at an Antarctic outpost. Overloaded with gross-out special effects, the movie seems destined to appeal mainly to connoisseurs of splatter-cinema (and, in that regard, it was somewhat ahead of its time). Carpenter, working from a weak screenplay, does all he can to raise shudders with the minimal material, but his atmospherics are disappointing, as are the performances. Still, the outlandishness of the violence stays with one--it's memorably disgusting. *1/2 from ****","

"akshatmahajan","25 July 2021","From so many years I have been hearing so much great about this movie. People even call it one of the best horror movie ever made. This rose my expectations but I was not that much satisfied with the movie as much other people are. I really wanted to like this film. But if I'm honest with myself, I ended up being a little disappointed.For me, the movie was not that much scary or tense. There are some good tense scenes such as the one where they test the blood. But for the most part, I felt like I was watching just an ordinary drama.If we talk about performances, I loved Kurt Russell and others were okay. Direction by John Carpenter was just like his other movies such as Halloween. There was some issues with pacing but it will not effect the overall experience.Overall, the movie is good and different for it's time. It was just that I expected too much and I found it underwhelming.","

"gbbonkers","15 June 2022","I thought it was dumb in 1982 and watching it again 40 years later, it's even dumber. I honestly don't understand how anyone can call it anything but amateurish. I suppose Carpenter learned some lessons making it, so that might make it worth something. One dimensional characters - just a bunch of names - and who put MacReady in charge? Simple minded gore fest, if anything.","

"TwistedContent","3 January 2020","Even after seeing the majority of John Carpenter's films, ""The Thing"" has still very strongly remained my favorite of his, and, let's be frank, it is one of the best horror movies ever made. From its awesome opening sequence to the ominous ending, ""The Thing"" is an atmospheric and cold journey through a siege against the unknown, masculinity in crisis, distrust, and, to this day, the most amazing practical effects galore.John Carpenter's initially underappreciated horror gem is perhaps not exactly flawless, but it is, in my opinion, one of the very best exercises in the horror genre of the 20th century. Taking place in a remote research outpost in Antarctica, ""The Thing"" executes a kind of a haunted-house atmosphere and finds the horror in the tension between the all-male inhabitants. The Thing is found (well, the Thing finds them) and an icy bucket of fear, stress, paranoia and distrust is thrown onto the characters. On one hand, the characters are not very deep or multi-dimensional, Kurt Russell's MacReady has as much character as Clint Eastwood in most of his westerns, who is merely a clever and brave hero figure with good morale; on the other hand, during my every watch of ""The Thing"", it has never mattered much. As far as I'm concerned, there's no space for more. Although ""The Thing"" is most likely best known for its special effects, I think that the horror and atmosphere exist there independently, a work of a great director at his prime. The special effects are the tastiest cherry on the cake ever - gory, gooey, macabre, highly creatively and professionally made, the kind to remember and get impressed at every next visit. On top of everything, the cast seems to be enjoying their every minute & Ennio Morricone delivers the least Morricone original score ever, and makes it as disturbing as the film demands..
Whenever the topics of wintery, gory, sci-fi or 80's horror movies get brought up, or the theme of best horror movies ever for that matter, ""The Thing"" is one of the first movies popping up in my head. Thank god for John Carpenter. If you somehow haven't seen it yet, December is the time. My rating: 10/10.","

"lambiepie-2","12 November 2002","I cannot believe I never added my two cents about this film as yet!This is one of the best films of all time. Many critics and movie-goers alike talk of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" for setting trends and being ""his best work"". Those folks have not seen this version of ""The Thing"" because it is right up there with ""Halloween"".John Carpenter's work shines in this film. He took a film that was already made and instead of ""re-making"" the film, he made the book the first film was based on! Brilliant.The casting of each man was great, the tension between them was real, it made me scream, made me scared, made me guess, made me laugh, made me question, even up to today ""who goes there?"" in that film. This film had no Hollywood sweetie pie or funny-type ending, and what a bold move not to have one in 1982. Another brilliant move.I was at the screening for this film when I was on vacation in Southern California. The audience at the screening went wild! I carry those memories for years, it was so much fun! We all thought that there was no way on God's green earth this film was not going to be a hit. But by box office receipts, it was a dud because of ""ET, The Extra Terrestrial"" and ""Poltergeist"" two very good family oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this film came out.This film was what I, as a horror film adult buff was looking for, a horror/thriller with an adult script, and real adult actors. Not kids playing adults. Not little Miss ""big-breasted"" scream-queen of the day running around screaming for titilation BUT real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues you'll ever hear. Heck, being a feminist, I didn't even MISS women in this film! And good for Mr. Carpenter by not putting one in there, it really wouldn't have made sense! (Unless, ""The Thing"" was actually feminine! Something to think about!)I saw special effects of that time I had never seen before, I saw makeup that made me sit up a few nights. This is what horror/thrillers of today are missing. Today, the Directors wimp out. Today, the Studios wimp out. Too much CGI and not enough belief, too much CGI and not enough story, not enough imagination. You leave the theater and in a week -- or less  -- you forget about the film and move onto the next grand film opening. This one stays with ya. That's one of the marks of an excellent film.On many reviews I've written how now paying $10 for a film is horrid. For films like this one, you'd pay it and not feel slighted. This film is NOT for everyone.I find it horrific that they lable this film a ""cult"" film. I find that the audience is broader than many would lead you to belive and although not a commercial success in 1982, this is an example of how releasing a darn good film on the wrong date can make a darn good film look bad. After John Carpenter's film, many people copied many techniques, make-up, special effects and story lines from this version of ""The Thing"".I am now excitd to go on record and state that this film is one of the best films of all time, very much under rated. Please see it uncut, please see it in letterbox and please hear it digitally. You'll talk about it for years as well.","

"departed07","16 March 2008","""Paranoia, paranoia, everybody's coming to get me!"" Harvey Danger, Flagpole Sitta John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is a remake of the 1950's classic science fiction movie where in his updated version, paranoia has never gotten so creepy. After his 1978 movie ""Halloween"" where horror pictures proved that evil will never die, Carpenter takes evil to a whole new game.Set in the Antarctica region where like ""Alien,"" nobody would hear anybody scream, a group of researchers doing God-knows-what happen to stumble upon a Norwegian rifleman shooting at a dog where after the gunman is shot down, questions are being asked by the group including the no nonsense pilot R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russell) in which they see more what they bargain for.During the film after an attack scene involving an alien dog, the investigation group fears that something has hit them and will never get out. Paranoia leads to fear, fear leads to questioning and those seeking questions will finally have their answers.John Carpenter's The Thing is a ""don't turn off the lights"" movie where even during it's time despite the fact that E.T. hogged all the credits, it proves to be a classic thriller from icky special effects to make you either scream or shield your mouth to scenes that you'll remember in your nightmares.","

"gridoon","19 September 2000","The jaw-dropping special effects are practically the only worthy aspect of this surprisingly dull (and wildly overrated) horror movie. Lifeless and uninvolving, filled with uninteresting characters and potentially tense scenes (the attempt at trying to figure out who is infected by examining blood samples) that don't pay off. Don't ask me why, they just don't. Carpenter's followers sometimes seem willing to admire all his efforts, but this time he misses the mark.  (*1/2)","

"pc95","27 August 2023","It has been over a decade since I'd seen John Carpenters' 'The Thing'. There are not alot of competently to say anything of good sci-fi-horror mixes made. 'Alien' is the 'head of the class'. Some might mention 'Aliens' but that seemed more of a sci-fi war movie."" Anyway 'The Thing' is top notch. The concept is from one John Campbell novella, and Carpenter does well to adapt into a full movie - the paranoia is wonderful . The cast is very good. Kurt Russell was a great action lead in the 80s and 90s, and he's great here too. Also liked Donald Moffat and Keith David's performances. The affects still hold up pretty well and were strong for 1982, and the setting is well done and mostly believable looking. Recommended - 8/10.","

"cthirlby","2 November 2022","The Thing is a classic and I'm glad I saw this on the big screen for the 40th anniversary with the legendary Kurt Russell. The entire cast is pretty great and they work together well to create a high tension story where nobody trusts one another. I think the prosthetics and makeup in the movie are absolutely fantastic considering the time even more so. The movie is set in a place where everything is about the same colour palette (even the buildings) and I think when characters are on screen or the thing or fire which is commonly used it makes all that pop out a lot creating a really unique visual look. Again seeing the cast go against one another in a high tension kind of mystery thriller where even the audience is unsure of who the thing is at times is great for the story and makes everything more effective! You really get into the shoes of the characters in the story as you feel what they feel and are constantly on edge and guessing. It has psychological elements in the movie which I always love in movies, I'd say it thrives more off that element and creating a guessing game which is insanely tense instead of showing the monster all the time and it definitely succeeds. It's a great high tension horror movie with a unique monster and a awesome main character to follow!","

"dannylee-78082","5 March 2023","I've watched the film on one of those 20 min movie summaries and that did not do it justice. Though I knew that the dog was infected by The Thing from the start, the movie still had its suspense and paranoia for 100 minutes. While I agree that the special effects and the grotesque visuals were amazingly creative for a movie made 40 years ago, I think the movie's strong suit lies in its writing. The script is airtight and Mr. Carpenter's direction doesn't allow us for any room for breathing. Everybody is at constant paranoia and doubt of each other in the isolated Antarctica camp, and such fear does not feel forced or arbitrary. The only one that the audience is certain that is not infected is MacReady, because he is the main character. However, the character does not feel like he's invulnerable because he's been put at plenty of danger, even the suspicions of his own teammates. His fate remains unknown as he faces Childs, whom many argue online that is the final Thing, which I agree with.Music was also another nice touch, composed by the legendary Ennio Morricone, which I just realized he passed in 2020. I was so out of things at that time. RIP to the legend. I'm very glad I got to watch this movie now. Certainly a milestone in the movies of the 80s. Genuinely hard to understand why it was so critically panned in its release. Really puts things in perspectives that movies do get reevaluated and rise above the test of time.","

"Degree7","19 August 2013","John Carpenter's update of 'Who Goes There' and 'The Thing From Another World' came out 31 years ago to seemingly little fan-fare and even less critical reception. Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.' released the same year was a more popular take on the alien invasion story. Apparently people weren't too keen on seeing hideous creatures from outer space wreaking havoc in the same way.Which is a shame, because 'The Thing' has a lot going for it. The opening sequence with a pair of Norwegians in a helicopter chasing down a sled dog, with the steady synthesized beat of the soundtrack, proves something eerie, and leads into a brilliant set up.Unfortunately, once things go wrong and sh*t hits the fan, the paper thin characterizations of the cast come to the forefront. All of these 'scientists' and researchers on this base are rather bland, and the viewer never gets a sense of having known these guys. For example, in 'Alien', you feel like there is real camaraderie among the crew of the Nostromo, with subtle rivalries and edgy small talk providing so much detail and backstory to their characters (much of it ad libbed). But in 'The Thing', you never get a chance to hear these guys talk, or develop as interesting human beings at all. The most you see is them playing ping pong or getting high. The only insightful one is Kurt Russell's ""Macready"". Everyone else is simply fodder for the alien.Carpenter seems to rely on mantaining the viewer's interest with the next highly inventive, but over the top special effects gore scene. Some say that ""the less you see, the more frightening it is"". Well someone forgot to tell Carpenter this on set, because each creature appearance is gooier and more in-your-face than the last. Even worse is the concept of the shape-shifting alien itself. It seemingly has the ability to transform into whatever shape with whatever powers it wants. A lot of it seems to depend on the amount of material (people) it absorbs, but in some cases the survival of the characters seems entirely arbitrary and not down to the rules that should have been established in the beginning. The main concept is that each piece of the alien is a living whole. But the film doesn't account for the idea that even the tiniest, invisible molecules that float through the air are part alien. And if the alien transmits itself through bodily fluids, why can't it just breathe onto someone and absorb them that way. Because of this and the weakly written roles, the atmosphere of paranoia and claustrophobia that should be developing is instead undercooked, and leads to many of the characters going crazy and acting unrealistically way too soon.It's literally only 10 minutes into the assimilation process, when one key scientist character realizes that mankind would be doomed within a year of the alien reaching the mainland. So what does he do? Round everyone up like a sensible person and try to weed out the alien? No, he suddenly destroys the radio and the helicopter, therefore dooming his companions to be trapped on a remote base with an enemy they can't see. Oh, and he tries to kill them all.Of course, the alien isn't too smart either. Rather than laying low and maintaining its disguise, it would rather transform at the most inopportune moments to get itself destroyed.Honestly, the film has little depth to its story or plot, and is really just a B-grade slasher flick, like Carpenter's last film 'Halloween'. With characters that seemingly want to die, how else could you describe it?","

"sqeaston9","27 May 2010","This is, and will likely remain, one of my favourite movies. It's as near perfect within it's genre as any movie I've ever seen. The cast, the sets, the script, the special effects: all excellent.To my mind, there are two ways to make a really entertaining horror film. Play it straight, or throw in a heavy element of comedy. This movie plays it straight right down the line, although that's not to say there aren't a few laughs to be had, there are some classic lines of dialogue.The movie's soundtrack and score establish a sense of foreboding from the get go, and as the characters witness one scene of unimaginable horror after another, the fear and paranoia grows palpably. The imagination and thought put into the special effects lifts the movie to a level as yet unsurpassed, Rob Bottin deserved an Oscar for his work here, with an honourable mention going to Stan Winston who stepped in to alleviate the workload, providing a particularly memourable scene.I can't believe I didn't see this at the cinema at the time of it's release. This is partly down to the critics, who should hang their heads in shame for panning this film. But beyond that, the trailer was awful, failing completely to convey the brilliance on display here.Another criticism levelled at this movie is there are no female cast members, but there really wasn't any need for them. The last thing this movie needed is a romantic sub plot.Much as I love Alien, I prefer this. To quote John Carpenter, this monster isn't just some guy in a suit. This is the best of the best.You've probably seen this movie already, but if not and you like horror (particularly of a Lovecraftian flavour), I urge you do so at the earliest opportunity.","

"TheMovieDiorama","24 February 2018","I knew I was in for a good time due to the massive cult following, but damn I was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. Having watched the sequel/prequel first, I was aware of the story and concept. A remote research facility in Antarctica is invaded by an otherworldly organism that is able to imitate other cells. Not everyone is human, so the remaining workers must figure out who to trust. That is where the horror and thrills arise. Push aside the gruesome, terrifying, hideous looking aliens that are constructed to precision for now. It's the isolation that sends chills down the spine. An enormous sense of claustrophobia where trust issues are the major concern. The characters are well established, well developed and well acted enough to, finally, create an involving story. Seriously, the plot is so welcoming that it invites you to figure out who might be ""The Thing"". Tense, gritty, dark...just how I like my horrors. Now we can throw in the inventive practical effects to enhance the film onto a-whole-nother level. Wow. It was so disgustingly delicious that I had to rewind back, hold up my phone on snapchat, and record those scenes so that all my friends can appreciate what I went through. Even the cries that ""The Thing"" yelps is nightmare inducing. John Carpenter's direction was slow, but it worked! He took his time to bring life to the characters and to create the chilling tension. I found the scene transitions slightly basic and jarring, simply fading to black. Also the ending was a tad underwhelming, was hoping for a final minute twist or something. But these are small nitpicks. The Thing has stood the test of time and is still engaging as it was when it was initially released. I've finally watched it, and suggest you all do the same as well. I won't look at huskies the same way now...","

"nathangoffnett","3 March 2023","The Thing is a claustrophobic, paranoia-driven horror film that follows a crew of American scientists trying to fend off an extraterrestrial monster before it picks them all off, one by one.The film is incredibly grounded, in a way that increases the horror and tension surrounding our main cast. In the beginning, the story takes its time, building on the threat and fear of the creature. But this slowly transitions into a paranoia-stricken thriller that has everyone painted as a potential threat. This worked really well, keeping the audience constantly on their toes not knowing who to trust. Throughout the course of the film, there is not an incredible amount of action. The movie thrives on the tension that slowly builds through the characters distrust, but this lends itself to making the more action-packed scenes that much more effective. The prosthetic and prop department did such an incredible job on the effects. There are some really twisted scenes combining body gore and genuine horror that was ahead of its time.Technically, this film is superb. The acting is great all around, but Kurt Russell shines in this role, taking over every scene he is in. The score is subtle but adds a sense of ominousness to the film that I really appreciated. Cinematography is top notch, with some impressive set designs and creative shots that create a great amount of immersion.Overall, this film is amazing. Although it does impact me as much as Halloween did, it is still an instant classic that should go down as John Carpenter's 1B to his Halloween masterpiece.Score: 91%
Verdict: Excellent.","

"Captain_Couth","19 August 2005","The Thing (1982) was another one of those classic horror films that was being remade during the eighties. But this time hot director John Carpenter was given the green light to re-invent the film. Carpenter decided wisely to remain faithful to the original story line and created a dark and depressing movie about alien mutations and co-habitation within humans. He also create an atmosphere of hopelessness with no light at the end of the tunnel. This film is also the first part of his Apocalyptic Trilogy.A group of scientist and technicians are living inside a U.S. research base in the middle of Antarctica. Nothing but the cold and cabin fever accompanies them. One day they get a taste of excitement when a helicopter from a nearby Norwegian research base is chasing a dog. They fail to kill the dog and die in the process. The guys were left wondering why they wanted to kill that husky so bad. unfortunately they do find out but by then it's too late. A mutating copy cat alien is living within the base. One by one it kills off the crew refusing to show itself. Paranoia and madness soon sets in and no one trusts anyone. By the end of the film, the men destroy their own refuge. The last two survivors sit in the ruins not trusting one another and die in the cold Antarctic wastelands with weapons in hand waiting for the other to show their true self.Another great film from John Carpenter. Too bad he couldn't keep the streak going. His next film was a unwise choice. Due to the lack of box office drawing power, Carpenter was forced to jump on the Stephen King band wagon and adapt one of his works for the silver screen. It was a failure as well, but nowhere as cool as THE THING.Highly recommended.","

"jacksflicks","22 July 2010","Horror, like hot sauce, is a kind of self-indulgence. It's considered part of the sport to try to push the envelope, be it a seared mouth or a heart attack. I think John Carpenter has designed a movie for the audience who says, ""C'mon scare us to death.""Every element of this movie is exquisitely crafted -- from the soundtrack to the cutting and pacing to the uncompromising, unrelenting savagery -- all packaged in sharp, handsome photography and skilled acting. The buildup is a crescendo of violence and gore.But what's the point of all these fine production values? A message? Existential dread? Survival? Compare this one to Alien. Both climax with the hero calling out the great terror. Like cowboys. You know, the outlaws move into town and kill everybody until they meet the lone hero in the final showdown. Here, the story is just a vehicle for the real purpose of this film: pure horror.Almost 30 years later, and John Carpenter's The Thing is still the scariest movie I've ever seen. If I lived for being scared to death, then I'd give it a 10.","

"avik-basu1889","21 April 2016","'The Thing' was one of those big cinematic blind spots for me. This film like many cult classics didn't enjoy critical or box office success at the time of its release, but has gradually over the years become a very popular and loved movie. This was my first viewing of the film and my review is based on a single viewing.I don't think it is possible to watch 'The Thing' and not get reminded of Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. Both films came out in round about the same time within a span of 3 years. Both films are about a team of people isolated in the middle of nowhere being hounded by an alien monster. However, 'The Thing' didn't impress me anywhere near as much as 'Alien' does every time I watch it.Let me first point out the elements of the film that I liked. The practical effects that are on show in the film are some of the best ever put on screen. There are moments of sheer terror due to the convincing nature of the practical effects. Another positive aspect of the film is that John Carpenter really knows how to build up the tension. He knows how to subtly move the camera or hold a shot for just the right amount of time to create a sense of dread in the mind of the viewer. Another great aspect of the film is the dog that we meet right at the beginning. Carpenter somehow got the dog to perform as well as any animal I have ever seen perform on screen. My problems with the film stem from the lack of depth in the script and lack of depth in the characters. 'Alien' works so well because it has so much going on underneath the monster film surface. It is a commentary on the gradual loss of human qualities in the age of capitalism along with the exploration of disturbing themes like rape and unwanted pregnancies. Unfortunately I did not find any subtext in 'The Thing'. I have read some articles where people have tried to find an allegory for the Cold War, but I just didn't observe any depth in the screenplay to think along those lines. Another huge problem is that I found the characters to be very bland with no depth what so ever. In 'Alien' we don't get much back story about the characters either, but Ridley Scott used multiple scenes where we found the characters engaging in small talk and being as realistic as possible allowing us to relate with them. 'The Thing' has almost no quiet scenes where the characters are talking about ordinary, banal stuff. That just didn't make the characters interesting enough and since the characters weren't compelling enough, I found myself losing interest slowly and at the climax of the film I really got bored.As I wrote earlier, this review contains my opinions about the film after watching it once. I might change my stance with subsequent viewings. But right now, I have to say 'The Thing' left me underwhelmed.","

"morphricky","1 July 2012","Let's start with the good: The special effects are fantastic, the actors are good (despite what they have to work with) and the over all setting is good.So why do I dislike it so much? First of all, the characters have very little personality. Besides their work and their mood, there isn't much to define them by. Bennings and Garry are supposed to have been friends for ten years, but you wouldn't ever have guessed so since you never hear about them actually having known each other that long until Garry says so. When somebody dies, nobody seems bothered. Garry is the only one making a halfhearted attempt to not make Macready burn Bennings body... only to join in and watch Bennings burn. When I first saw the movie, I was confused as to why nobody suspected Garry be a monster... who would be so casual about their best friend for ten years dying? After Bennings is burned, Garry never mentions him again as if they never met. It's also kinda ironic that Macready is the one calling Bennings ""George"", but Garry never does.And the characters are so unbelievably stupid. Of course there is always somebody ending up alone or walking off alone, making them at risk to be contaminated. And in the end, they have figured out the only one who could possibly be contaminated is Blair. They have figured out flamethrowers will kill the monsters in just a few second. They have figured out that staying together is the best option. So what do they do? They split up to look for Blair and they blow up the whole base with dynamite! So of course someone dies because they walked alone, but then they realize they will freeze to death because they blew up the whole base. Which they didn't need to since Blair was underground! Who thought that was a good idea? Of course they never actually show a scene where they agree it is a good idea..Overall, if you can look past the glaringly obvious stupidity of the movie (everybody keeps walking off alone all the time despite knowing they can get contaminated), the lack of character development (if any), then you got an action-packed movie with an eerie setting and some of the best special effects of its time.","

"Bob-45","10 September 2004","It's impossible for me to discuss John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" without also discussing several works that provided its inspiration. J.w. Campbell's classic story ""Who Goes There"" was also the inspiration for the Howard Hawks/Christian Nyby version in 1950. Since Hawks/Nyby lacked the technology to portray Campbell's shape-shifting, assimilating creature, they focus on Campbell's theme of the ""red scare"". It's absolutely true communists occupied high positions in our government, including the CIA at the time Campbell wrote ""Who Goes There"". Hawks/Nyby focused on the camaraderie of the artic crew to represent ""the American way of life,"" while making the creature a ""walking vegetable,"" feeding on blood and preparing its occupation of the earth through asexual reproduction. Thus, the creature represented the ""Communist menace"" and the scientist a ""fellow traveler. By 1955, the US government, through oppressive laws against communist in this nation, as well as the Hollywood Blacklist,had created a backlash against ""McCarthyism"". As a result, ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" presented the humans as communists and the ""pod people"" as the ""fascist oppressors"". Also, in 1955, the UK released ""The Quatermass Experiment,"" AKA ""The Creeping Unknown,"" which presented a creature that possessed the assimilation half of Campbell's ""Thing"". By the time of the unsuccessful release of John Carpenter's film, the ""red scare"" portion had been utterly discarded. However, the paranoic theme of ""do you ever really 'know' somebody?"" essence of Campbell's story remained. Even better, ""movie magic"" technology had made it possible to represent the creature as Campbell presented him: a communal shape-shifter capable of masking his actual identities, but capable of viciously revealing it true multiple natures when threatened or ""hungry"". Carpenter wisely retained most of Campbell's story. Especially effective is the scene where each of the Antarctic station's crew member is tested by having a hot wire submerged in his blood. It's a pity Carpenter didn't retain Campbell's ending, which was to discover that the creature was using equipment parts to build a communicator to alert his kind that the earth was ripe for invasion. Carpenter's ending is not as plausible, but it is certainly more exciting.The television version of the movie adds narrative exposition, providing the background of each character. I believe that was improvement over the initial movie release. After all, the characters start dying off so quickly, it's difficult to identify them, much less develop some empathy. Nonetheless, ""John Carpenter's The Thing"" is taut and terrifying, a genuine classic that did not deserve it's box office failure. Kurt Russell, Keith David, Richard Dysart, Wilford Brimley and the rest of the cast turn in fine performances. Ennio Morricone's terrific music perfectly complements the dark, moody cinematography and editing. The creature effects are outstanding and quite gruesome. Only the short animation sequence lacks plausibility.""John Carpenter's The Thing"" has finally become a bonafide classic, and that's a good thing (pardon the pun). I give it an ""8"".","

"gigan-92","23 January 2012","A+ Not just my favorite John Carpenter film of all time, but one of my favorite films of ALL TIME. I'm very familiar with Carpenter's work, but this one takes the cake by far. Let me say right off the bat the cast is gold. Everyone gives very convincing performances, the top favorite of mine being Kurt Russell (obviously), Wilford Brimley and Keith David whom many may recognize as King in Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"". The story which is indeed a re-make in some regards, is by Bill Lancaster, and is extraordinarily well done. It's a familiar sci-fi/horror plot premise, but never done as well it is here, or since. It keeps you guessing right up until the end, and I don't exaggerate.The effects by Albert Whitlock and Rob Batitin are extremely bad ass, all before the times it got so easy with CGI. It's grotesque and beautiful all at once, being one of the high-points in effects history. The stop motion animation is one of the best of its kind, and continues to terrify. And to top it all off the legendary composer Ennio Morricone does the score. You might recognize the name from the Spaghetti Western glory days, seeing as he composed for all three films of the Man with No Name trilogy. The score is chilling and definitely one to remember.It's a spectacle in film history by many means, and I shall revere it eternally.","

"gregsrants","12 November 2003","Watching John Carpenter's The Thing, I was reminded of how good a filmmaker he used to be.  In the 1970's John brought us Assault on Precinct 13, Elvis and one of the most profitable and copied films of all time, Halloween.  In the 1980's he was involved with no less than 8 films including Escape from New York, The Fog, Big Trouble in Little China and Starman.  However, it was his 1982 release of The Thing that is most revered in the new millennium and now it is re-mastered and re-issued on home DVD.Based loosely on the original 1951 film, Thing From Another Planet, John Carpenter set out to remake the film keeping only a few of the original ideas in tact.  To ensure success, John assembled an A-list of B-list stars including Wilfred Brimley, Keith David, Richard Mauser and Richard Dysart and circled them around best friend Kurt Russell (Escape from L.A.) in an isolated compound in the Arctic. The film begins with an encounter with a Norwegian group of men who are trying to shoot and destroy a dog from their helicopter.  The chopper is soon destroyed and the Norwegian killed, so Kurt (Mac) and the others set out to discover the origin of their visitors.  Upon arrival at the Norwegian camp, they discover dead frozen bodies and a block of ice that seems to have transported something to the compound.  Outside, they find the burned remains of a creature that has human-like qualities and they inevitably bring this hideous piece of flesh and bone back for examination.  
It's not long before the dog they took in exposes itself to the group as an alien lifeform that can take on the identity of another being, and soon one by one, the humans become victims and hosts to the alien's intentions. 
Shot almost 23 years ago, I am amazed at how the special effects still hold up today.  The creature effects by Roy Arbogast (Jaws, Return of the Jedi), have not been bettered by new technology and the scene where Norris (Charles Hallahan) has his chest collapse and literally loses his head and we watch it grow spider legs and run out of the room, is as potent and memorable as John Hurt's creature birth in the original Alien.This movie had a lot of things going against it in 1982.  It had a cast that consisted of only men (not one woman appears in the film), it had effects deemed too gory for the times and most importantly, it was released the same year as Steven Speilberg's cute alien movie E.T.  However, where E.T. ,upon present day viewing, shows signs of dating and blue screen special effects, The Thing continues to show like it was made just yesterday with precision and craftsmanship.  The movie has a sense of claustrophobia and urgency and its end, which is far from Hollywood typical, might leave room for a sequel possibility, but not with the same cast of characters.  I also appreciated that John Carpenter did not fall prey to the typical horror film ending that we are now so accustomed, where just when you think it is all over, the killing entity gets one last cheap fright out of the audience.The 90's and post 2000 have not been kind to Mr. Carpenter.  He has directed such stinkers as Ghosts of Mars and Escape to L.A. and Body Bags, and John's reluctance to work under the Hollywood umbrella of a major studio and budget now show with his cheesy effects and locations.  However, he and Kurt Russell can look back proud to the summer of 1982 when they put one of the best horror films in history on celluloid.","

"neil-476","21 April 2011","John Carpenter takes Howard Hawks seminal science fiction tale about the remote polar research station beset by an alien invasion (by which I mean invasion by an alien) and updates it from the 50s to the 80s - in colour, some genuinely low temperatures, and some state of the art mechanical effects rather than James Arness in a rubber carrot costume.It's pretty good. The sense of claustrophobia and paranoia is well generated and maintained, the performances are all good (and Kurt Russell is an excellent lead), and the effects are imaginative, shocking, and extremely well executed.Remakes often fall short of the originals: this one surpasses its predecessor by a clear margin.","

The Thing is a 1982 film directed by John Carpenter (who i am a fan of) it stars Kurt Russell. The story is an alien crash lands in the middle of winter in Antarctica or somewhere i can't quite remember and it can take over the body of anyone or anything. It takes over anyone who poses a threat so it ca wipe out the enemies around it so it has won and has no more enemies.**/*****","

"a_chinn","15 January 2018","I've of course seen this film many many times before, edited for TV, on VHS, laserdisc, DVD, and now in crisp HD, and am happy to report that John Carpenter's classic horror film still holds up today as just as shocking, grotesque, claustrophobic, and as scary as hell as when it first came out in 1982. Also, my favorite line in the film still holds up. ""I dunno what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off."" Without spoiling too much of the plot, Kurt Russell is part of a US outpost in Antarctica who encounter an alien life form that kills and then assumes the form of outpost members, leaving those still human unable to figure out who is friend or foe, ALA ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" A remake of the Howard Hawks produced ""The Thing from Another World,"" Carpenter ups the suspense tenfold by not having one alien terrorizing the isolated team, but has any and all of the characters a potential enemy. It's utterly chilling when at one point a desperate Russell tells the group, ""I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack me right now, so some of you are still human."" Members of that team are played by an excellent and varied group of actors who include Keith David (""They Live"" ""Pitch Black""), Wilford Brimley (""The Firm"" ""The Natural""), T. K. Carter (""Runaway Train"" ""Southern Comfort""), Richard Dysart (""LA Law"" ""Being There""), Richard Masur (""Risky Business"" ""My Girl""), Donald Moffat (""The Right Stuff"" ""Clear and Present Danger""), and other character actors you'd know their face if not their names. The script is credited to Bill Lancaster (son of Burt), and is his only original film script outside of ""The Bad News Bears"" (arguably the greatest sports film of all time) and an okay sequel, ""The Bad News Bears Go to Japan."" The script is efficient and stripped down in a way that perfectly matches Carpenter's directorial sensibilities. When this film originally came out it was considered wildly gory in its graphic violence, courtesy of special effects wizard Rob Bottin. SPOILER ALERT! I remember my mind exploding the first time is saw the a head extricate itself from it's burning torso and then sprout spider-like legs to escape. The same can be said for the chest cavity opening up to bite off Richard Dysart's arms, and for so many other wild moments that are a result of Bottin's truly monstrous creations. All of this is masterfully shot and edited by Carpenter and crew. The crisp, stark photography by Carpenter's regular DP Dean Cundey, who'd later go on to work regularly with Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard on high profile Hollywood films, is absolutely dynamite. And enough cannot be said for the score by Ennio Morricone, which interestingly sounds more similar to a John Carpenter score than most Morricone scores. Morricone at this point had done some work for Hollywood films (""Days of Heaven"" and ""The Exorcist II""), but this is the film that really started landing him bigger Hollywood pictures such as ""The Untouchables"" and ""In the Line of Fire."" It's also fun to watch rewatch this film if you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"" due to Tarantino's many nods, intentional or not, to Carpenter's film. Overall, if there was ever a perfect marriage of science fiction and horror, ""The Thing"" is that film. And if you ever want to have a vigorous argument with me, let's start a discussion about what is the most perfect horro film of all time.","

"Kdosda_Hegen","18 May 2020","Horror movie which proves Practical effects are superior over CGI and increase the actors' performances.
The practical monster effects looked disgusting and realistic and as far as I know they smelled terribly, which make the actors be disgusted by it. The set was also very cold which led actors to feel it like we see in the movie. As far as I know the actors got script by parts not revealing who is a monster so it would keep the mystery for them and also make their performances better.
As for movie itself, the practical effect do in fact look very good, they realistic and disgusting, the monster designs are brilliant. The movie is very thrilling and unpredictable. And the ending, it's so amazing. The ambiguous mystery of 'is Childs The Thing or not' and the 'gasoline test theory' truly makes it phenomenal experience of an ending.
Definitily one of the best horror movies, for the effort alone.","

"darkness317","29 July 2008","(Warning, I spoil the entire movie.) The Thing is all about... well ya know, the Thing. What is the Thing? An alien, but what kind of alien? I dunno, but it sure is ugly. It's pretty awesome because it can infest people and make them grotesque alien monstrosities. Every little piece of the alien becomes a new, little alien, i.e. one of the victims who is assimilated gets decapitated and his head becomes a spider monster.What am I going on about? The film is set in Antartica and revolves around 12 American scientists who start getting assimilated One -by-one they get Thinged until only 2 are left alive and the ending is left ambiguous as to their fates. (I think they probably froze to death.)The Thing has been frozen in the Antartic for thousands of years before being awakened by a Norwegian science team. It kills all but two who're killed in the opening of the film at the American base. Throughout the flick it tries to rebuild it's space ship, which to me proves it was the pilot and was planning on flying away home, where ever that is. However the Americans decide to kill it and they do so with fire! I love sci-fi; I love horror. I especially love it when the two get mixedand mixed well. I like to think of The Thing as a well shaken vodkamartini of awesomeness. It's my personal favorite horror flick, it has an influence on me as a (wannabe) filmmaker in that It's OK to have disgusting, mutating monsters. I like to know my world has a healthy dose of grotesque, evil beasts from another planet. That makes me happy.What the hell am I talking about now? Anyway, I hope you've seen it already if you're still reading. (Sorry if you haven't.) Peace.","

"Mr-Fusion","28 August 2012","Take ten guys (all on the raggedy edge), strand them in the middle of frozen nowhere and trap them with an alien monster that wants to replace them one by one . . . Hell of that isn't a surefire recipe for a kickass horror movie. And more than that, ""The Thing"" boasts a genuinely palpable sense of atmosphere, even from just the sound design alone. John Carpenter sows the seeds of mistrust early on and that feeling just compounds as the story unfurls. This is a masterpiece of paranoia. It's why, even after we get to a point when the effects no longer hold up (they still do), this will still be an intensely unnerving movie. Ballsy, too,a with that ambiguous ending (not to mention the fantastic closing line).Also, Kurt Russell and a flamethrower. This movie's operating on a whole other level! 10/10","

I've seen this film at least 100 times, it isn't perfect in some ways, but I've neverminded that at all. It's a pure horror film with great special effects from Rob Bottin and great lighting by Dean Cundey.

"bob the moo","18 February 2002","The staff of an Antarctic research post discover that an extraterrestrial is around that can replicate any living thing.  It's powers are extraordinary and the staff find themselves in a fight for survival.This remake of the classic Howard Hawks film `The Thing From Another World' takes the guts of that story - improves some things but loses others. Obviously the film greatly improves the special effects and frights provided by James Arness in 1951, however it does so at the loss of some of the suspense of the original.  This still has a great feeling of paranoia about it that filters through everything.  The story is basic but it has plenty of chills at the start, but once the effects start we see everything and it's more gross than chilling.That's not to say the effects aren't good.  They still look good now - despite being 20 years old!  It's telling of how much work went into this to reflect that effects wizard Rob Bottin was checked into hospital with exhaustion once the movie was finished.The cast are all pretty good.  Russell is a good lead, although this is more of an ensemble piece than a star vehicle.  The cast are gradually whittled down until they reach the ending that is not only downbeat but subtle and intelligent.  It's flawed if you think about it too much but it works really well after so much gore.Overall it'll never have the classic status of the original but it is definitely a good example of a modern sci-fi that is almost as good as Alien in terms of atmosphere and thrills.","

"Wuchakk","2 August 2018","RELEASED IN 1982 and directed by John Carter, ""The Thing"" stars Kurt Russell as the helicopter pilot of an eleven-man crew at a research station in Antarctica who encounter a ghastly shape-shifting alien that perfectly replicates the appearance of its victims.This is basically a sequel to the 1956 film and even includes footage from that classic sci-fi/horror. The creature is unconventional to say the least and this adds an eerie component to an already otherworldly and confined Antarctic setting.There are no females and therefore no romantic complications. The characters are thin so the story focuses on the thing and how the crew tries to track it down and eliminate it, if they can. The nature of the gruesome entity, how it functions and how it can or cannot be killed leaves you with a lot of questions.

Technically brilliant in its camera-work and editing, superbly scripted and acted, one of the best openings, one of the best endings, tension and paranoia sustained throughout (with countless viewings), an excellent soundtrack, and open to multiple readings and analogy, there simply aren't enough superlatives to do this film justice.

"Richie-67-485852","20 August 2017","I caught this on the big screen when it came out and I watched myself at some point actually gripping the armrests of my movie seat. I was eagerly looking forward to this being a die-hard fan of the 1951 version that I have seen countless times and will see again. I like this movie because we got to be one of the boys in the film and because of that, we closely follow what they do and say and care for them. That's the idea! When the movie takes off, it is hard to determine who is who and when but one doesn't have time to figure it all out. The intensity prevents that and before we know it, we went along for a thrill ride! Kudos to everyone involved and a hearty well-done. I have a small gripe about this and the 2011 film. In the 1951 version, the head scientist goes without sleep for days during the whole ""thing"". I get it too. Who would want to sleep with this type of discovery. Also worth mentioning is they don't waste anytime trying to access the spaceship. Both the 1982 and the 2011 completely dismiss both the spaceship for exploration purposes and more investigating of the ""THING"" . Now ask yourself, wouldn't you want to see the inside of a spaceship from another world? Its weapons? Food? Clothing? Endless items? Finding and exploring the ship is one thing and understanding what we find is another. Who could sleep? Both films avoid going there. Shame too. In any event, the premise remains and holds like no other: A spaceship and its occupants. What do they want? Where did they come from? Wow! I like to eat while watching and this movie is good for a meal, a tasty drink and a decent snack of choice. Sunflower or pumpkin seeds work very well so that you don't nail bite or get antsy. Get started and watch The Thing! In fact, I am going to watch 1982 movie right now (umpteenth time)","

"lasttimeisaw","25 February 2018","Turning Antarctica into fire and brimstone, John Carpenter's analog-era paranoia horror classic THE THING boosts a smorgasbord of eye-popping special make-up effects predominantly fashioned by a 21-year-old Rob Bottin, these human-things, dog-things, assimilated by an unknown, amorphous alien life form, aka, the thing, are gooey, gross-out but also drolly camp without a sinister layer of menace, the truth is, once the thing reveals its true color out of its host's body, most of the time, it is too maladroit to escape from being incinerated by flamethrowers, so the imperative for it is to hide in plain sight among its human hosts, a group of a dozen (male exclusive) American researchers stationed in their secluded antarctic base, and waits for rescue team to make it pandemic. Once audience inures to its animatronic gimmicks, the movie's scary quotient begins to lessen (save for Morricone's minimal, ominous score) and what Carpenter plays up is the burgeoning distrust among those Yankees under the bleak, claustrophobic circumstances, yet, character-molding is not right up his alley (Ridley Scott's ALIEN 1979 is a far superior antecedent), ergo THE THING is considerably deficient in ammunition of imploding conflict and treachery, and high on explosive ruckus after survivors are routinely rubbed out by ringing the changes of optical spectacles, no one is safe apart from the top billed Kurt Russell, as the helicopter pilot MacReady, who is granted with a protagonist's halo and inexplicably brainy enough to float the idea of testing remaining crew's blood to identify who has been infected, on account of the thing's innate survival instinct. However, there is a loose end in the extrapolation that MacReady has been assimilated on the ground of his torn clothes, which goes unsolved. THE THING is Carpenter's foray into studio filmmaking and it relishes in its dazzling production value, its refrigerated setting in L.A. is a huge project and the matte painting of the place where the alien life first crashed on earth significantly enhances its filmic quality, although ineluctably, an analog proto-computer is a dead giveaway of its time and superficially deployed in spoon-feeding us with information such as how fast an apocalypse is at stake if the thing gets out of the station alive. Lastly, Carpenter discloses his ace in the hole in the end, when two survivors seem to calmly wait for their slow death from cold in the now blown-up site, an ambiguous gesture may or may not intimate that one of them is infected by the thing, which beckons various theories from cult followers after its initial tepid reception, in hindsight, THE THING, a seminal gore-fest that beckons a glut of imitations in the years to come, is arguably Carpenter's best.","

"moritzherz","2 April 2023","The 80s were a decade of pure entertainment. No dumb political ideologies, entertainment first, you could say. The Thing is such a movie because its primary. Intention is to entertain the audience with a compelling, tenseful horror story. And the movie does that very good. The great Kurt Russel delivers again with extraordinary acting. The setting is well choosen and creates, together with the maestro's brilliant score, a mysterious and dangerous atmosphere. The monster looks great, visual effects also deliver.So that's for the entertainment part. There is of course the other, deeper part of the movie, yet another feature of the 80s. If you think deeper the 80s will always give you moral lessons and, like in the Thing, an ending that lets you think about its meaning. This is what makes this movie a great horror film, because you do not really know if the monster is dead or oone of the two survivors.To summarize it up, watch the Thing, it's a classic that defined the genre.","

"koltonbrett","3 March 2022","Similar to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, John Carpenter's The Thing was pummeled by negative reviews upon release by critics, only to later gain much love and appreciation. Unlike with The Shining, The Thing isn't bogged down by unlikable characters and scenes which don't advance the story in important ways. Kurt Russel always seems to be a huge presence in his films. His likability always makes the movie itself more likable. The whole cast deliver convincing performances. This movie doesn't hold back on gore and suspense. The paranoia is real as everyone is suspicious of each other not being human. The need for a strong leader arises and Kurt Russel's character is the obvious man for the job. Even so, the fear and lack of trust creates tension between the characters and apprehension in the viewer. This alien monster puts an abundance of blood, slime and grisly images on display. So much so that the initial shock factor proved to be a bit too much for its viewers in 1982. Even all these years later, the special effects hold up well. This movie has a lot going for it. I believe it will only continue to age well as a classic science fiction horror film.","

"TheNabOwnzz","25 November 2018","The easiest kind of horror these days are obviously cliché fests overloaden with cheap jump scares. All of which require little in the way of intelligent writing or cohesive storytelling. The Thing (1982) however, takes us back to a time when psychological and intelligent horror films were in abundance, and this is definitely one of the best in that regard.The Thing is undoubtedly one of the scariest movies ever made. There are very little cheap jumpscares, since The Thing focuses on the most difficult kind of horror to create; The psychological. The scare-factor in The Thing is simply because of the combination of excellent framing, eeriness in atmosphere and ofcourse the haunting soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. The extremely disturbing roar for 'The Thing' also contributes to the terrifying feel of it. All of these factors give the audience an uneasy and on-edge feeling that both enhances the tension significantly and creates a haunting atmospheric feeling. Ofcourse the practical effects ( Possibly the most discussed and praised aspect of The Thing ) are also a significant factor in the creation of actual fear and disgust throughout this film. When comparing these special effects to those of a later prequel, The Thing (2011), a painstakingly obvious verdict is that the latter's overuse of CGI really looks phony, ridiculous and not at all scary in any way. You could call the practical effects of The Thing (1982) absurd, and that is exactly what it was going for. The practical effects look disgusting, haunting and menacing. Besides which, the 'Thing' was shown far too often in said prequel, as opposed to the little screen time in this particular film, which significantly drains the tension as the psychological side of a largely unseen 'thing' is about the most intelligent feeling of unease one could get. That is why this is more than just a mere 'monster' flick, as the emphasis is on the tension and paranoia instead of the actual gore.As stated before, the original soundtrack by Ennio Morricone is an absolutely haunting piece that breathes fear ridden atmosphere like no other. A sense of hopelessness, paranoia, and a literal mimic of a human heartbeat are all present in the score. The opening scene of a helicopter attempting to shoot down a dog/wolf while Morricone's score is playing is quite possibly one of the most absorbing, haunting & beautiful opening scenes ever made.The acting is excellent, which is ofcourse a pretty rare thing in a horror film. There isn't a single weak performance visible, and a unique stand-out has to be the half dog, half wolf actor Jed. Never looking at the camera or crew, while maintaining this sense of alienism in him ( Especially the scene where he is first lead to the kennel, followed by his haunting wall-stare ), truly make it seem like this is the actual Dog-thing. Characterization is not as thorough and in depth as for example Alien (1979), but none of the characters are forgettable and each acts according to their personalities. Most of the characters are shown to be resourceful and intelligent, since they quickly figure out the Thing's intentions and origin, as opposed to the usual stereotypical horror dumb characters. There might not be much interesting in terms of the narrative itself, but The Thing's strength comes from the way that the situations themselves are filmed, and director John Carpenter purposely left a lot of key events off-screen, to feed the eager anticipation of the audience even more, and leaves us wondering, just like the characters, who to trust.With very little over the top exposition and a superb flow of visual storytelling ( Like the scene in which 'twoface' revives and assimilates someone, which is shown with a slight movement beforehand while blood starts dripping down, as opposed to ham fisted dialogue ), The Thing is indeed an intellectual piece of horror filmmaking, and Carpenter was ofcourse one of the best in the business at this regard. There is a lot of purposeful ambiguity ( Especially in the much discussed final scene ) which only enhances the paranoid and unknowing feel the audience receives.The Thing is one of the most frightening films ever created, and does this through superb direction and tension building, extremely disturbing and terrifying practical effects, but above all, the creation of paranoia and inner fear and mistrust. When you analyze the situation our characters are in, there are very little films that have a more terrifying premise, since this alien organism is disguising itself as a normal human being, and could be anybody next to you at any time. Thus it is definitely one of the greatest horror flicks ever created.","

"FKDZ","8 October 2021","I don't really have much good to say about this, because I went in with a high bar, this movie is supposedly one of the best horrors and is rated very highly here on imdb, and I see it mentioned in pop culture everywhere. So there I was..excited to finally see this classic.This movie, aside from the stunning practical effects, is a dud. It's characters are flat and boring, you care for no one, the music is mediocre, the script is muddled and messy with plothole galore. The characters felt like robots, not real people, no heartbreaking reactions when there college's die a horrible death, not being impressed by the thing, like seriously, there wasn't once someone cursing about how messed up the situation is.. how?!?! The characters deal with the thing as if it's something normal and totally realistic to exist in their world.The only real reason to watch this, is for the practical gore, because still to this day it's gross and vomit educing. It's done with so much detail. You'd think all the budget went there. Seriously phenomenal, and what the movie (rightly so) is most famous for.But aside from that, nothing to see here.Also...what was up with that Norwegian sniper with his absolutely hilariously terrible aim?! Takes you out of it right away.","

"andyajoflaherty","2 October 2023","Based on the novel 'Who Goes There?' by John W. Campbell, the Thing is a sci fi psychological horror like no other. Set on an American research base deep in the Antarctic, the crew there encounter an alien creature that can mimic other life forms, and mimic them perfectly. As the creature slowly begins to take over the crew, they have to put aside their mistrust and paranoia to find a way of stopping it from reaching civilization. But when you can't tell who is human, and who is not...who can you trust?I originally saw the Thing a long time ago, and at the time I appreciated its tone, atmosphere and special effects... but it never really struck me as anything more than a good film I'd probably not watch again. Recently however, I found myself caught up in online discussions about the film, praising its intriguing plot, deconstructing its mysteries and calling it a masterpiece... so I picked up the 4K version and watched it again. Oh. My. God....I must say that I usually find John Carpenter a bit hit and miss, but dear lord is he on form here. The film expertly crafts a forboding atmosphere of paranoia and dread, serving as a sci fi horror whodunnit, of sorts. The characters are all completely believable as they gradually turn on each other for their own safety, and when one is revealed as an alien you immediately think back to when they could have turned, and who they have been in contact with. The film is loaded with clues, mysteries and red herrings, and picking it all apart is half the fun.As for the other half - the horror.... and boy does this film deliver in spades. The practical creature effects look absolutely incredible, even today... and you can tell effects lead Rob Bottin put his heart and soul into this project (quite literally, he ended up bring hospitalised due to malnutrition and exhaustion after working on this film practically non-stop for 18 months, he even slept on the set!) and that combined with Ennio Morricone's creepy score providing the film's heartbeat, the tension never lets up. You never know when the creature will appear, and when it does it's always a gut wrenching cacophony of shrieks, gore, slime, tentacles and face chomping.The best thing about this film though, is trying to work it all out, and even today fans are still picking this film apart as they try to unravel its secrets. It is an absolute travesty that it bombed upon release, both critically and with audiences... to the point where it almost ended John Carpenter's career. The world clearly just wasn't ready, but now we are, and I have to say that The Thing is an absolute masterclass in atmosphere, effects and tension... that somehow gets better the more you watch it. A legitimate contender for the greatest horror film of all time, and is an absolute essential watch for fans of horror.","

"bayou_hannibal","1 June 2012","When I first saw this movie at the ripe old age of 9, I was beyond terrified. John Carpenter's sci-fi horror masterpiece about a shapeshifting alien gave me nightmares for years. After another 30 years and about 50 more viewings, it isn't frightening to me anymore, but that hasn't diminished the value of this tense and suspenseful classic. The critics liked Starman more, and Halloween was more influential, but The Thing is John Carpenter's best movie – no frigging contest. Considering how many great movies Carpenter made in the '70s and '80s, that's saying a lot.In the late '70s and early '80s, the horror genre hit its peak. Ideas were still fresh, but the taboos that kept the truly horrifying movies like The Shining and The Exorcist off the screen were gone. Young directors like John Carpenter brought inspiration and energy to the medium. Without $100 Million CG animation budgets, directors were free to focus on storytelling and script. This is the stage in which the film industry found itself when Carpenter made The Thing. The script is almost air tight, leaving virtually no plot holes or loose threads, other than a couple of mysteries that are better left unanswered. The cast was perfect, and the direction was excellent. Most of the actors were no-namer types who didn't do much after The Thing, but there are no weak performances in this film. The soundtrack is also a huge asset to the film. I still get chills whenever I hear it during the introduction and over the closing credits.Best of all is Rob Bottin's absolutely incredible work on the film's visual and special effects. The monsters don't get a ton of screen time, but when they do, they are gruesome and horrifying. The practical effects in the movie still trump any computer generated garbage that has been made in the past 15 years. Although they are a product of a wild imagination, the monsters in the movie seem incredibly real, and because they seem so real, they are also threatening. In the recent 2011 prequel, the monsters simply weren't as scary, in large part because you couldn't shake the idea that you were watching a high-tech cartoon.The movie begins with two crazy-looking guys hunting a dog from a helicopter, shooting at it as it flees across the Antarctic. It is one of the best opening scenes of all time, drawing you in immediately. There is a whole rich backstory at work, and at the start of The Thing, you get to see the aftermath. After the dog incident, the story unfolds almost like a Lovecraftian version of ""Ten Little Indians"". Once The Thing is first truly revealed, the rest of the movie is filled with tense paranoia and fear. Adding to the tension is the extreme isolation of Antarctica, and the knowledge that nobody can come to rescue the scientists. All the while, we realize that these men are not the only ones in danger. If the Thing kills them all and escapes the continent, the world is doomed. At one point, The Thing also gives you the best jump scare in the history of film. I have introduced this movie to about a half dozen people, and the ""test"" scene has made somebody jump out of his or her chair every time.Another of the great qualities of this film is the memorable cast of characters. Even though there are lots of them, they all look, sound, and behave differently enough for you to get to know them almost immediately. After only one viewing, you can probably remember that there was the cowboy-ish MacReady, the cook on roller skates, the guy who loved dogs more than people, Wilford Brimley going crazy, the doctor, the weak-willed radio operator, the crazy guy, and the big tough looking black guy. Unlike almost every other horror movie with a body count, every death feels significant, because even minor characters are well developed.In my humble opinion, The Thing is one of the Top 10 greatest movies ever made, and the #1 movie of its genre. This is why the movie has such a strong cult following despite its lukewarm reception on release, and why if you see it for the first time, you will probably still enjoy it even though it is 30 years old. If you want to see the best of the true horror genre (i.e. not the idiotic slasher genre misclassified as ""horror""), The Thing is absolutely essential viewing.","

"saytosandeep","19 January 2014","The Thing. Sounds scary, right! Yeah, it is scary, mysterious, thrilling sci-fi horror classic. The plot is one liner, scientists in the Antarctic are confronted by a shape-shifting alien that assumes the appearance of the people that it kills. The special effects are perfect and have not dated at all even after more than 30 years. It builds the tense atmosphere from the very start and helped by hell like stormy chilling weather of Antarctic and thunderous background score. All actor act well and Kurt Russell as lead does his job right. There is loads of blood bath and brutal killings by the scary thing. The open ending takes the movie out of ordinary and leaves you wondering why there is no sequel at all of this classic? Nevertheless, until they could think of worthy sequel, enjoy this timeless sci-fi horror classic.","

"imbluzclooby","4 March 2012","I first saw this in the theater at its initial release in early 1982. This is definitely a testament of how horror films should be made. Although their is copious amounts of gore, it never lags in suspense, good acting, taut plot buildup, and enthralling drama. This is a time when CGI was nearly unheard of and special effects and horror make-up were made from scratch in an artists studio. Yes, they literally had to build and create tangible/three dimensional puppets, robots and props to enhance the movie monsters and horror effects. By the early 80's there were several notable horror make-up artists that earned the majority of the business. Therefore, they were at the height of their craft due to competition and a deep appreciation and desire to explore the depths of their creativity that the imagination could fathom.The drama is also excellent as the story envelops e are immersed in the crew's journey and struggle to examine what is happening to their camp due to this alien intelligence that has invaded upon them. Kurt Russell is simply great as the unshakable MacReady. The rest of the cast offers some good performances as well.What makes this movie so frightening is that eventually the crew members all become feverishly suspicious of each other as this inevitable terror befalls them. They must decide to either collaborate or fight each other in order to survive. Being stranded in the desolate arctic snow is claustrophobic enough; but add the ominous and elusive alien presence with the growing resentment and distrust for each character and we are left with a confounding morass destined for doom. A sequel to John Carpenter's version was made in 2011 and is supposed to be the backstory to his version. These two movies should never be confused for the 2011 version is far inferior and lacks the good acting and character development. It also relies to much on the usage of CGI to be taken seriously.","

"evanston_dad","20 October 2009","The man who showed the world how scary a movie he could make with nothing more than a shoestring budget (""Halloween"" in 1978) demonstrates that less can be more when it comes to making a horror movie that will truly scare you.John Carpenter gets quite a bit more money to throw at the screen and uses it to create all kinds of nifty makeup and creature effects in his 1982 cult classic ""The Thing,"" but it's the movie's quiet early scenes, before anything much is actually happening, that are the most unsettling.""The Thing"" isn't exactly a remake of the 1951 classic ""The Thing from Another Planet,"" though it shares the source material of that film. It's a reinvention and is largely better than the earlier version. Kurt Russell and a group of scientists working at the North Pole become prey to a shape-shifting alien that has the ability to look just like any one of them, and the real tension in the film comes from the mens' increasing inability to trust one another -- after all, who's an alien and who isn't? This adds an effective punch of psychological complexity that was missing from the 1950s version, which presented itself as a straight-up monster movie. In John Carpenter's version, the paranoia and claustrophobia that develops from being trapped in your own worst nightmare are as scary as any of the oogie-boogies running around in the snow.But the film relies too much on its gross-out effects, which no doubt looked state-of-the-art in 1982, but which look silly and dated now. Carpenter didn't take to heart the lesson he taught audiences in 1978 -- that a person's imagination is going to cook up something ten times scarier than anything a filmmaker can actually show you on screen.This is a worthy addition to the horror canon, but its quality has been overrated by fanboys.Grade: A-","

"DanSchneiderLovesKids","27 March 2020","Horror and thriller doesn't get any better than The Thing. There are so many great aspects such as how the people die, how the people turn against each other, and how the people reflect on what could happen next.However, the part that makes The Thing such a gem is that the characters don't make any dumb decisions. If they do, it's either a very minor mistake, or it doesn't factor into the group as a whole (like when Fuchs follows the thing outside. We don't actually know what happened to him, but he was found burned). The smart decisions are what keep the characters alive, but the thing is so powerful that it can work its way through it and still penetrate them. In the end, however, the thing is outsmarted, blown up, and only two people survive (one of them could be an imitation).","

"virek213","5 November 2006","In an era where nearly every great horror film of the 60s and 70s is being remade for audiences weaned on horror flicks of today that are not too terribly good, it is instructive to look back at John Carpenter's 1982 opus THE THING, which itself is a remake--of a childhood favorite of the director's, Howard Hawks' 1951 sci-fi/horror classic THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE. Although Carpenter's film was not initially that big a box office hit when released in mid-1982, it has since garnered a very large following.In fact, Carpenter's film is less of a remake of Hawks' film than it is a reworking, as he goes back to the original idea posited by the source material, namely the John W. Campbell story ""Who Goes There?"", in which a US scientific crew in Antarctica is menaced by a shape-changing alien thawed out from the ice after 100,000 years. Kurt Russell, who had starred for Carpenter in the director's 1979 TV movie ELVIS and the 1981 film ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, heads a cast of stalwart character actors, including Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart, and Richard Masur, in this tension-filled exploration of paranoia, as the shape-changing ""thing"", which first comes to their camp in the form of a guide dog a Norwegian team is trying to kill, takes over each of them one by one. It isn't long before everybody in the camp begins to mistrust his fellow man. The ending of the film, in which Russell and David are the only ones left, has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity akin to the similar codas to both THE BIRDS and STRAW DOGS.Almost universally, when the subject of THE THING is bought up, the emphasis is on the extremely gory special effects make-up and alien designs created by Rob Bottin, who had worked with Carpenter on the 1980 horror classic THE FOG, and on Joe Dante's 1981 werewolf film THE HOWLING. These effects are indeed quite spectacular and graphic, and even today, they can also be quite stomach-turning. But all of this would make Carpenter's film nothing more than a high-end splatter epic if the direction, the story, and the acting weren't up to snuff; and thankfully, each of them are. When he's not concentrating on the enormously gruesome transformation sequences, Carpenter builds suspense in the same Hitchcock-influenced way that informed his previous films HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, with cinematographer Dean Cundey's prowling camera-work, particularly through the corridors of the station, a significant help. The acting enhances an already-fine screenplay adaptation by Bill Lancaster; and we are also given a taut score by Ennio Morricone, whose work on director Sergio Leone's classic 1960s Italian spaghetti westerns is well known to all, including of course Carpenter himself. THE THING also features additional fine visual effects from Albert Whitlock (who worked on many Hitchcock films, including THE BIRDS), and Roy Arbogast, who worked on CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and JAWS 2.Carpenter's film was not the success it could have been because Universal chose to release this graphic shocker a mere two weeks after it had released Steven Spielberg's far more family-friendly E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (not surprisingly, critics and audiences at the time favored Spielberg's excellent film over Carpenter's equally excellent but exceedingly different one). Also, most of the horror film box office business in 1982 was going to another Spielberg-produced film, POLTERGEIST. As a result, at a cost of $15 million, THE THING suffered from lack of attention in its time.Over time, however, many have come to see Carpenter's film for what it is--an extremely gory but extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, done with a great deal of flair and a true understanding of the psychological paranoia at the heart of its story. Though it is still quite gruesome, THE THING should be as much remembered for the skill by which the story is put together as it is for the gory alien designs and make-up effects; for it is the storytelling skill and the suspense that make it so memorable in the final analysis.","

"Thorsten-Krings","26 March 2007","I don't really understand what all the rage is about. I found the story fairly slow moving and the ""Dark Star""-esquire crew is in the way of creating a real threatening atmosphere. I find that odd as that has always been Carpenter's strong point, particularly in Assault or The Fog. Whereas the violence in the Fog is all inside the viewer's head, here it's right on the screen. I guess it's slightly unfair to judge with hindsight as the special effects are made less spectacular by the fact that we have seen them in Alien. What puzzled me most was Morricone's soundtrack which sounded is exactly like the music Carpenter himself composes. Why hire someone to copy you? All in all, I find Carpenter's first big studio film highly overrated.","

"shaun98","2 February 2003","**definite spoilers**Next to ""Halloween,"" ""The Thing"" is perhaps John Carpenter's best film. Although it was a critical and commercial flop when first released, it has since gained its own cult following--not as large as the former, but large enough to convince horror fans to reevaluate it. Set near the South Pole, the film concerns a deadly space creature that infiltrates a scientific outpost. This being can absorb any living organism and duplicate its characteristics with chilling precision. If left unchecked, it may wipe out the human race. After a good twenty years, it still holds up for the most part. It is a simply-plotted but well-crafted effort, generating an eerie, desolate atmosphere, not unlike that of Ridley Scott's influential ""Alien."" Filmed in Alaska, the bleak cinematography makes it seem like it really was filmed in Antarctica. There is an acute feeling of isolation, the sense that we are thousands of miles away from any other human being. It is just them...and it.""The Thing"" is a more explicitly violent film than ""Halloween,"" but delivers just as much in terms of good, honest shocks. There are moments that still compel the viewer to jump, moments that are genuinely creepy. The special effects work used to bring the alien to life are still very good--nice and gooey, and the fact that the creature makes its presence known when we least expect it only adds to the terror. Inevitably, it attempts to infiltrate this unfortunate group of people. The screenplay cleverly second-guesses the audience's attempts to devise the identity of the creature. Just when we think we've guessed who it is, the film surprises us. The paranoia and claustrophobia is nearly unbearable at times. The creepy music adds more to the atmosphere.In some ways, this is arguably a better film than ""Halloween;"" Carpenter's pacing is more assured, and the shocks more intense. Yet, the characterizations prove to be the film's major weakness. Aside from Kurt Russell, most of the characters tend to be fairly interchangeable, unfortunately hampering the effectiveness of the material to some degree. It's still a well-made thriller that is obligory viewing for genre fans. I will not compare it to the 1951 original, unseen by myself. The remake is good enough to stand on its own merits, and many have argued that it is actually a superior film. Whatever its flaws, it delivers.*** (out of ****)Released by Universal Pictures","

"mbhgkmsgg","10 November 2020","I'm actually very torn by how I feel about this film. On the one hand, I absolutely love this type of horror. And I thought that technically speaking this film was spectacular. Everything from the practical effects and the constrained location to the moody soundtrack and acting was spot on. But on the other hand, I just didn't feel much of anything while watching The Thing.Perhaps the biggest problem was my expectations. For years now, I have been hearing nothing but great things about this film and admittedly, my expectations were as high as they get. Also, I didn't really know what this film was about apart from some vague idea I had. And perhaps another problem was that I really wanted to like this film. But if I'm honest with myself, I ended up being a little disappointed.I just didn't find this movie to be particularly scary or tense. There are some incredible sequences such as the one where they test the blood. But for the most part, I felt like I was watching just a pretty ordinary drama with some gory practical effects that ended up doing quite little for me. And perhaps that is the problem. I just feel like I'm so used to seeing much more brutal stuff even on the news, that I just can't appreciate films like these as much as I should.Nevertheless, I'll have to rewatch this film in the future. Now that I know what it's about, I'm hoping that I can appreciate it more. Because The Thing is a movie that I would absolutely want to love. It does so much so incredibly right.For now, though, take that rating with a pinch of salt. I'm anything but sure about how I feel about this film and what I should rate it as. One thing's for sure though, Carpenter is quickly becoming one of my favourite directors and I can't wait to see his other films. And even if I didn't enjoy or appreciate The Thing as much as I perhaps should've, it is a movie that I will more than happily watch again.","

"hellraiser7","24 January 2012","Trust has became a scarce commodity, because of the simple fact we never really know a person, because in reality it's impossible to know a person fully, there is just always something to hide.This film is my favorite film from my favorite movie director John Carpenter as well as my favorite horror film and favorite films in general. The film really helped pave the way for the way we look at most horror and suspense films but also was an inspiration for video games like ""Dead Space"", parts of ""Resident Evil"". It's also a prime example of a remake when done the right way, don't get me wrong I like the 1950's film it's good in it's own way but I love the 80's version more because of just that being good in it's own way, a way I just like the most.There is so much I really love about this film, I love the creature effects from one of my favorite make up/effect artists Rob Boltin as well as the late great Stan Winston. I liked seeing the dolperganger alien whenever it pops out it just seems to always transform into whatever the heck it's suppose to look like, it just seems to be a mixture of things, their slightly inspired by the monster from H.P. Lovecraft's stories which always had bizarre otherworldly monsters.I love the location it really sets up a atmosphere of fear and isolation. The music from Enccio Morone is excellent, it's one of my favorite horror scores ever, the theme song is memorable it just has that evokes the feeling of cold lonely fear. But most importantly it was in the suspense which is the best thing and a common thing with Carpenter.You are just on red alert throughout the whole film, because the danger doesn't let up even in it's peaceful moments. I actually jumped a few times watching this movie and that was a great feeling that I don't get often. Like that infamous blood test scene, I was at edge having both anticipation on who the Thing is but at the same time scared of the possibility of the Thing. You really feel just that sense of paranoia. From the enviorment which feels palpable, just the cold, darkness, and sheer isolation knowledge that these people are in the middle of nowhere and there is no one out there to help because their miles away. There is also the fact that no one can really run or even hide, because you really can't get out of the facility there is nothing out in that envorment to run to, you'll freeze to death in mere minutes. And due to the Thing being anyone along with how small the facility is it leaves few places to really hide. So it leaves you with that sense of doom and dread because of the lack of those options.It's true these characters don't have much depth and you don't get to really know most of them despite some personality on them but that's the point. Even though these characters all live under the same roof you can see their all not really close, and it just goes to show that just because your in the same enviorment doesn't automatically mean all will be friends, it's like with the high school and collage I've been to there are hundreds or almost thousands of people that I pass by or go to class with and barely know a mere fraction of them.Though a couple of characters stand out for me mainly MacReady and Childs played by two favorite actors of mine Kurt Rusell and Keith David. Both just have some of the best lines and both are proactive in the situation, I like how both are scared but their don't wimp out against danger they fight back, let alone that really is the only option available. Let alone both are likable and easy to emphasize with a bit because both are bored and just want to get the heck out of the facility. I don't blame them, I might just go nuts being there to long without a anime convention or girl around that can really suck.The Thing itself it an enigma, we don't really know it's motives or if it even has any. Nor does it seem to have really a true form since it can replicate itself by being viral. I even like how it behaves which makes it feel all the more real, despite primal it's capable of intelligence it was able to fly and tried to rebuild it's spacecraft after all. It's also kinda like a game hunter, the Thing doesn't really do anything at first but you know it will once it's moment comes, the humans it imitates are practically it's camouflage which is it's edge, and what makes it a hard opponent to nail. Did the Thing come from another planet we haven't discovered or may'be another galaxy. Was the alien suppose to be some kinda scout for invasion of Earth or could it of been some sort of bio weapon some alien race created to help destroy Earth's inhabitants. I don't know your theories are as good as mine, but that makes the creature all the more scary.This film was an acknowledgment of cold war paranoia as well as paranoia of disease in the 80's decade but I also feel it's relevant today with our decade with our war on terrorism and chemical weapons/disease epidemics. The main theme is about distrust of our fellow man, how it is not the enemy seen that will destroy people but it is fear of the stranger that becomes our undoing.It's not the enemy that you see that should be fear, it is the enemy unseen.Rating: 4 stars","

"zeekwunlau","8 May 2020","The story is very smooth. From the beginning, the Norwegian drove a helicopter to chase the dog for thousands of miles, which caused suspense. Why on earth was such a big deal? And at that time, I discussed with the male ticket that this dog's behavior is not ""dog"", and seeing people do not wave their tails also has a sense of alienation. This question was quickly answered, it turns out that this is not a dog at all, but ""the thing""
Behind the monsters gradually showed a fierce look, using psychological warfare to kill the scientific research personnel one by one and make everyone self-endangered. The picture is also bloody and full, there are many classic monster deformation lenses, and even some unique beauty. The scene of the doctor's electric shock to save people really shocked me. It was a completely unexpected scene.The blank space at the end is also just right. Is the black team member who returned suddenly a monster? The tired protagonist was paralyzed on the ground, thinking that the monster was finally resolved, but did not expect despair to strike again.And I think the settings of this film are more frightening than aliens. For the aliens, I always have a sense of separation from reality, because the spaceship / alien looks / story background and other settings let me always clearly know that this is not true and will not happen. The strange setting is that the monster will absorb you, imitate you, and eventually become the real you. This setting makes it very easy to extend, what if the monster escapes quietly? Is it true that there are many ""the things"" lurking in the society that are gradually eroding human beings, if our surroundings are already occupied by such monsters? We never know. This is the biggest fear this film brings to us.","

"whatch-17931","13 October 2020","Absolute classic, but it starts off cheesy, right from the title sequence.Showing the flying saucer right at the beginning gives the wrong expectation of the plot. But worse, a ""flying saucer"" was incredibly cliched in 1982, even more than now. But far worse, it looks like the Jupiter 2!The second big problem is the Norwegians after landing the chopper. It gets borderline slapstick. Tossing the grenade back instead of the pin, destroying the chopper. Then the Norwegian marches through the camp and is shot, again in a slapsticky way.I get the idea, it's to show the Norwegians have lost their minds for some unknown reason. To me, it seems like the Norwegians following and shooting at the dog from the chopper quite effectively conveys this. I don't get paid the big picture bucks, but I would have had the chopper never land (they are terrified of the dog) and they just scream at the Americans as the dog runs to them when they start petting and protecting it. Then, the chopper crashes for some reason.","

I can see why it has become such a classic for the horror genre.This is my first time watching and with me living in the year 2022 I very quickly compared this film to the video game ""Among Us"" because how could I not. The paranoia and stress in this movie is clearly an inspiration for that game and how it became so popular when it did. This film is like all the best parts of mystery thrillers but with a horror element added in for flavor.Just really well done. Before watching this I had only seen Carpenter's Halloween. I really look forward to watching the rest of his stuff (even though I hear it's all downhill from here).","

"gwnightscream","29 February 2012","Kurt Russell stars in John Carpenter's 1982 sci-fi/horror remake of the 1951 film, ""The Thing from Another World"" and based on the story, ""Who Goes There?"" A team of Antarctica scientists encounter a shape-shifting alien lifeform. This is set in the winter of 1982 with a team of male scientists and a helicopter pilot, R.J. MacReady (Russell) who find a dog and Norwegians that have been infected by a mysterious alien lifeform. They discover that the alien presence has the ability to assimilate human cells and shape-shift. As some of the team members become infected, MacReady and the others begin not trusting each other and try to survive. This is one of Carpenter's best that has amazing special effects by Rob Bottin and Russell is great as usual. I highly recommend this.","

"Nos2001","20 September 2021","Everything about this movie marks it as one of the greatest sci-fi/horror films of all time. The score (Ennio Morricone - as perfect as ever), the cinematography, the story, the acting, all virtually perfect. It's a marvel of 1980's cinema, to say the least. Has anything created since been as captivating and, to the true fans, as exciting to watch again, and again?Just when Alien (1979) made you think that nothing could possibly compare, along comes John Carpenter to add another classic film to the repertoire of absolute must-see, again and again, movies.Pure electric cinema, which will enthrall its viewers each time they watch it.And without wishing to repeat myself, the score! Oh my gawd! Just pure brilliance. Every note, every sound just adds to the overwhelming foreboding feeling that something nasty is going to happen, and it's going to be one of the most memorable pieces of cinema you will ever see.I originally rated this as 9/10, but now watching it many years later, it's got to be a 10/10.","

"RMS1949","2 November 2013","The original 1951 version while dated has always remained one of my favorites. That movie approached it as more of a science fiction story than the horror movie that John Carpenter made.. While this 1982 version was not the exact same storyline, it took the premise of what the original offered then ran with it.. If you go back and look at the original what made it really stand out was the crisp and intelligent dialog that went on though out the movie.. The 1982 version seemed more like a bunch of cowboys on ice rather than intelligent beings and scientists battling a being from another world. Not to say that I didn't enjoy it but for me visual scares do not put fear into me as much as that of an unknown terror approaching. Carpenter's version had the visuals but for me lacked suspense and intelligence.","

This film not only lacked in imagination and was filled with dull moments, but there was nothing tense nor suspenseful about it. The special effects were good enough for its times, and the ambiance was fantastic and essentially the plot focused on paranoia is a good one..but here lies the problem ...The suspense and tension was not cleverly executed, it was dragged down making only the top notch special effects pop. The film did not have a single female character which could have added a romantic element, no absolute humor and no fear factor aside from the ugly 'thing'. Bored through most of this dragged dull mess i regret investing a single second. Alas, its done and so please learn from me : Don't watch it or you'll be bored to death. I just can't seem to be a john carpenter fan ... i get disappointed with all his films.Final Grade C-","

"ShootingShark","25 August 2009","The peace of a US scientific outpost in Antarctica is suddenly shattered when a dog runs into camp being shot at by some crazed Norwegians. That night, bewilderment turns to terror when the dog abruptly mutates into a howling tentacled beast John Carpenter's remake of The Thing is one of the best science-fiction/horror movies ever made. It's better than the original, much more faithful to the short story it comes from, is extremely well played by a fine ensemble of character actors, features incredibly inventive and horrifying makeup effects, and is an utterly riveting suspense yarn about distrust and paranoia taken to the ultimate level. Scary stories tend to break down into two distinct types; the externalised campfire story, where the monster is out there (Jaws, Frankenstein) trying to get at us, and the internalised Edgar Allan Poe confession, where the monster is within us (Psycho, The Exorcist) and trying to break free. This movie is a perfect example of the latter. The Thing is both a slimy alien creature waiting to eat us but also a metaphor for pretty much anything you like (cancer / xenophobia / nature gone mad). The first half maps the scientists' discovery of what's happening, and the second pulls all the tension out of the situation as they snap, bicker, point accusatory fingers and fail to follow through on half-hearted plans of action. The 1951 movie is a model of men behaving with calm organisation in a desperate situation. This film is much braver, as it depicts a little society splintering into pieces and self-combusting; rarely does a film revel so much in tragic misanthropy. Carpenter's films deal again and again with isolation as a main theme, both celebrating the individuality of the lone hero but mostly reinforcing the grim reality that we are all ultimately alone. On a technical level it is a stunning film; the base and its snowy exteriors are brilliantly realised by designer John Lloyd, and Dean Cundey's fluid, unhurried photography is dazzlingly beautiful, all frozen blues and fiery oranges. The eye-popping effects by twenty-two-year-old Rob Bottin are nothing short of astounding, as dogs mutate into nightmarish beasts, a man's stomach turns into a gaping maw, a disembodied head grows spider legs, and flesh and blood dissolve into plant-like monstrosities. These elements, combined with a creepy low-key Ennio Morricone score, create a tremendous realism to what would otherwise be a totally insane story, and the end result is a powerful, disturbing, terrifying film. On its release, this movie had many critics, most of whom could not see anything beyond the special effects. Some who did also argued that the story is confusing and badly plotted - when and how do Blair and Palmer get infected, what happens to Fuchs and Nauls, does Norris even realise he's been taken over, who framed MacReady with the shredded clothes, and always, why don't we find out what happens in the end ? This for me is perhaps the best aspect of the movie - the answer to any of these questions is we don't know, and that's the entire point. The movie is about not knowing what's going on, not knowing who you can trust, not even knowing if you're human or not; that's what real fear is, and few movies show it, but this one does. Watch it, and figure it out for yourself. Based on a great 1938 novella, Who Goes There ?, by John W. Campbell Jr. Trivia - the dog/Thing in this movie was played by a malamute/wolf half-breed called Jed, and for my money he gives the best animal performance in all cinema; a lot of Oscar-winning stars could learn from him.","

"TheGreatMarkukini","22 March 2019","Stumbled on it exactly on Kurt Russel's birthday and thinking about all the references and praising talks my finger clicked on the play button. From the mere beginning with a glimpse at the intro I knew that I am in for a treat, but I didn't even know how delicious it might get.Following the plot germination, I was confused and thought that it is a complete mess: puzzled would have been the mildest word applicable. Then in a few steps my brain started working to uncover a chain of reasons that created a vision of something much more horrible than would even appear on the screen. This throttled the tension and the movie shifted the gears higher.It is without a doubt hard to go past the plot, but the phenomenal thing is the actual Thing! Oh boy, if you tell me that 1982 couldn't give the thrilling visual effects I might agree but as for the practical side it kicks even modern films right in the jam with a superb jab. The detailed atrocity gives you the disgust and earns John Carpenter the highest respect even thought of.The actors slide into a frame like Cinderella's foot into the shoe sharing the exact emotions you would have facing the situation that has a potential to break even a potent human brain. The iconic clothing and style sticks to the imagery and adds that sense of outlandish realism the boosts the sensation.Getting myself together after the end I could with utmost certainty say that 'The Thing' is an ultimate tribute to the horror movie industry and should be studied as an example of supreme dedication to achieve the ideal scare.","

"DrTuvok","2 June 2023","John Campbell's 'Who Goes There' is one of the best golden age sci-fi novellas, and after the somewhat silly vegetable-man of the first Thing movie, it would make sense that Carpenter's more faithful adaption would be better. Alas. More effective, yes, more appealing to modern audiences, yes, a better movie, no. For once the initial critical response wasn't that far off the mark.It's true that the movie is too much in love with gory effects.It's true that the characters are mere meatbags to be mutilated and killed, completely lacking (even before the descent into madness) the camaraderie seen in the original Howard Hawks film. Though Carpenter runs around trying to give them things to do they are essentially doomed from the alien's first arrival. The blood test to figure out who might be alien ends in complete disaster since even a Petri dish of blood can somehow explode into a mass of mutating organs. Using dynamite is even more ridiculous since, if every individual drop of Thing blood has its own 'mind' and autonomy, then blowing it apart would only result in many more chunks of Thing crawling around. The flamethrower is probably the best bet, if they could only figure out where to use it.So what is left? An effective atmosphere of paranoia, interspersed with a few moments of empty suspense and much outlandish gore to leave the adolescents gawking. It can be admired from a distance, I suppose, but as a story, as something the viewer can really latch onto, it falls flat. Carpenter's hipster nihilism defeats him in the end, for if nobody and nothing really matters, why should I care?","

"reddragonhero17","14 January 2023","I have a soft spot for sci-fi horror films as they blend the physical with the psychological. This, like Alien toys with the viewer's imagination as you don't know what's going to happen next or what the enemy looks like. Adding to that, like Alien is a sense of paranoia as the men can't determine who's the enemy. The effects of the creature are great, no CGI here, all practical and it holds up quite nicely which makes it all the more terrifying. The acting is great and every man has a different personality, though it lacks character development. Love the fact that it takes place in Antarctica, cut off from the rest of society, and with few weapons, only one really works against the monster. I won't reveal if there are any survivors, but I will give you this advice, don't assume that it's over until you see the credits.","

He is not a wimpy, politically correct 90's guy; who's into his own feelings, but a sarcastic,realist who is a hard drinking and toughf.  Somone you would need in a situation like this.  The suporting cast is just a good.  Your typical group of guys with faults and different personalities, that would act stressed out in these situations.

"jdaughtry002","22 May 2010","What can I say? John Carpenter does it again! Wonderful movie about an Artic Expeditionary group trapped in the Artic with little time left to live. It all starts out with a helicopter chasing a wolf/husky through the glaciers shooting and throwing bombs at it. We soon learn that this dog is actually the carrier for some intergalactic ""Thing"" that can change into anything it touches, well attempts to in some cases. AEWSOME special effects and gore; I love gory films, and almost lost my cereal on this gem. I strongly recommend watching the Collectible Edition with some hour or more of added behind the scenes of the movie including the special effects. Kurt Russell does a wonderful job with his style of witty humor (pouring his whiskey into a computer's motherboard after he loses to it over a game of chess). His lead role really sets the mood for this movie's ""entrapment"" feeling.","

This is where this films real horror lies the people who you think you can trust i.e. your friends are the people who try and rip your throat out so the enemy becomes your sense of trust.The special effects are amazing I recently was able to see a digital presentation of The Thing at the cinema and it looked awesome, usually when you watch this film because its shot against white you get glare on your screen very easily, in the cinema the lighting is set perfectly to prevent glare it really does look a lot better I recommend seeing it on the big screen for anyone.","

"jboothmillard","17 December 2008","This remake of the 1951 Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby film, The Thing from Another World, sticking more closely to the John W. Campbell Jr. novel it was based, with an updated screenplay by Bill Lancaster (son of Burt), and directed by John Carpenter (Halloween, Starman), this is a special effects extravaganza. Basically an alien ship crashed to Earth, and then we see a helicopter circling an Antartican snowfield, trying to shoot a dog, and this is where American researchers work in their facility. They let the dog into their facility, but what they don't realise is that it is an alien copy, and it is only when they see the remains of a mangled body they discover and realise this ""Thing"" can transform and take the appearance of anyone amongst them. Everyone is now a suspect, because they don't know who is the ""Thing"", and one by one, the unlucky few are suffering the horrific terror attacks to it. The only way to determine the alien is taking blood and putting it in a dish, to see reaction to a hot needle, and they have to make sure all other remains of it are with it to be destroyed. Starring Kurt Russell as R.J. MacReady, Wilford Brimley as Dr. Blair, T.K. Carter as Nauls, David Clennon as Palmer, Keith David as Childs, Richard Dysart as Dr. Copper, Charles Hallahan as Vance Norris, Peter Maloney as George Bennings, Richard Masur as Clark, Donald Moffat as Garry, Joel Polis as Fuchs and Thomas G. Waites as Windows. It is almost unbelievable to think that absolutely every effect in this film was created by animatronics, no CGI whatsoever, and you have to remember that things and people are being ripped apart, and they still move! The story is good, the acting is as good as you can get, and the special effects, what can I say, a good horror classic. For some reason it was nominated the Razzie for Worst Musical Score for Ennio Morricone, I'll admit it isn't amazing, but it's not that bad. It was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!","

"laurelhardy-12268","12 October 2021","Over the years, each & every friend, family member and acquaintance I've happened to talk to about this movie, has raved about this film. I've always concurred.In a word, creepy. Anything you can't see allows the mind to conjure. As it should be. Whatever it is though, it is certainly malevolent, and in a big way. It is cunning, incapable of compassion, and goes forth with a steel resolve.Morricone's music is perfectly unsettling throughout.Talk about a piece perfectly fitting; Morricone paints a musical portrait of the snowy landscapes. The music is so foreboding. And it foreshadows the (possible) doom of the crew. More than that though, the score really personifies the (non-person) evil presence. It's so effective, what should be the pristine white beauty of the landscape, feels instead, like a bleak & contaminated graveyard.I don't like spoilers much, and if I did reveal specifics of the story here, I'd be doing the film an injustice. It's basically a ""You had to be there"" situation.All that said, it's the creepiest"" movie I've ever seen, in and out of this genre.Carpenter direction is just plain excellent. Actors are great as well.Lastly, my favorite line comes from Richard Maser, who just witnessed 'an event' and who replies to the question 'What is it?"", with ""I don't know, but it's weird and pissed off"".No monster movie ever gets a 10. It's kind of ""Not allowed"". In fact, for those reviewers who are averse to horror, the ceiling is maybe 8, and then it gets marked down from there.This flick is a 10. Like other reviewers so aptly point out, this movie is extremely affecting, and gives the viewer an unsettling feeling that sticks with you a while. Really well done.Bob R.","

"vladthelad8666","29 March 2020","John Carpenter's The Thing does everything right. Brilliant casting, haunting atmosphere and it leaves you with many unanswered questions. With so many cult classics released in the 80's (Aliens, Terminator, The Fly etc.) The Thing takes it's place amongst the best of them all, but perhaps the one thing that really sets it apart from many horror movies, are its unique practical effects. Even after decades they still hold up exceptionally well and manage to really elevate the genre. This movie on it's own is a unique experience, that every movie fan should go through once or maybe more in their lifetime.","

"Chrimle","2 September 2020","The premise is interesting and the story began rather well. The pacing is really bad, none of the characters are memorable nor likeable. The acting is mediocre. The story is predictable and cliché. It fails to make a mysterious and thrilling experience as every major development in the story is a lazy exposition. The visual effects are great and disturbing.","

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","28 May 2013","Before this adaptation of John Campbell Jr.'s novel, ""Who Goes There?"", came The Thing from Another World (1951). Many people liked it at the time for its effects and thought provoking story line. But, I'm not sure if anyone suspected someone could overpass it. John Carpenter, the director of famed slasher movie Halloween (1978), takes on this project and executes it without a hint of weakness anywhere. At least none that I could see which seemed like a real flaw.The story is about a group of scientists in Antarctica than happen to come across a perplexing and dangerous threat. The threat is a creature of unknown species that has the power to perfectly copy the DNA of any organism it comes in contact with. Because of this, it allows the creature to devour its prey very easily. Over time, this creates high tension amongst the men because no one knows who is really themselves. However, the one individual who does his best to keep his cool (pardon the pun) is R.J. MacReady played by veteran actor Kurt Russell.It does not surprise me that Russell is in this film. Russell began working with John Carpenter back in the TV movie Elvis (1979), and they continued to make movies together since then through the 1980s. Along with Russell is Wilford Brimley (better known for having a mustache but shaved for this role), Richard Masur, Keith David and so on. Through the whole film, each actor gives their best performance in displaying the sheer terror in not knowing who is human and who isn't. But like most fans, Kurt Russell is the star of the movie and he puts in the best out of all performances because he's able to keep calm.Besides Kurt Russell, another notable part of this film is the overall set design and special effects. There are only a few places where a viewer can tell that it's not real but it won't matter because it will complete the whole picture. As for creature effects, Stan Winston is the main reason why everything worked so well. The gore is absolutely horrendous. It's not like tons of blood are being thrown everywhere but it's not pleasant either. The sounds are just plain icky and imagery is gross. Oddly enough, what impresses me even more, is that by the end of the film, the viewer still won't be able to give a good description of what this creature's original form truly looks like. It really just is, ""the thing"". There's no other way to explain it.The final touch to this film that really strikes fear into most viewers is Ennio Morricone's haunting film score. The instruments that play a big part in each track are the harps, flute, violin and bass notes that repetitively beat in the background. If that kind of music were to be played on a dark night in an alley or dim lit subway, I would feel very uncomfortable. But the reason why it is so much more effective in this setting is because besides the base that is man made, where else can one run? Antarctica is no beach walk. That's the scary part. This movie isn't in it for the jumps and shouts - its goal is to make you feel terrified. A true horror piece.John Carpenter's version of the 1951 film increases the gore, the terror, the musical dynamics and brings in a great cast to boot. Not for the queasy.","

"Horst_In_Translation","8 August 2021","""The Thing"" is a co-production between the United States and Canada from 1982, so this one here will have its 40th anniversary next year already. Kinda strange the (early) 1980s are this far away already. Anyway, I see there are several versions out there, but the most common one, also the one I saw the other day, is the one that is slightly closer to two hours than to 90 minutes. The language is really English from beginning to end with a very tiny amount of Norwegian early on. But really just minimal. This is considered one of the best and most famous film by director John Carpenter, a bit of a horror film icon, but I hope it is not really one of his best because that would mean that the many, many films he made are mostly genuinely mediocre or even weak because I am not particularly impressed by this one here at all. But I shall get to that a little later. The two writers were Bill Lancaster and John W. Campbell Jr. And they are both deceased now unfortunately. Lancaster was still fairly young here and died at an early age 15 years after this movie and Campbell was about as old as Carpenter is today, so he would be 110 now, which of course did not happen. For both of them, this film is by far their most known career effort. As for the cast, you will not find many familiar faces either. The one big exception is of course lead actor Kurt Russell. Or he is the closest to a lead maybe, also because of his character, from this ensemble cast. He is also first credit. He was 30 here. Keith David also deserves a mention. He won three Emmys and Russell was ""only"" nominated for one, but yeah feel free to check out everybody's body of work if you care what (else) they did. They were no rookies and acted before and after this film of course, but no performers that you recognize immediately and remember the name. On the crew members I will not elaborate in detail, but most did a fine job. Nothing to complain about for example in terms of costumes or sets.I think the bginning was really solid when we have that dog run away from the guy trying to kill it out there in the Antarctica. Of course, you wonder what is the reason for this absurd scenario and it is maybe an even better watch when you know the story and are maybe not watching the film for the first time. This is pretty much only the introduction though. The Norwegian guy is killed as the Americans think he has lost his sanity and is a loose cannon and this is also one of not that many graphically violence movies. We see very briefly that the bullet went right through the Norwegian's eye into his head on one occasion. Oh well. I guess this was one of the moments they removed from more family friendly versions of this film. Or would have removed. I don't know if those exist. The one I saw the other day had all these inclusions and I am glad it did. What happens is pretty much expected. The Americans try to find out what was going on. We see them move to the Norwegian's polar station and they see they are all dead and now they also understand something terrible must be going on. It's really all about the drama and horror and maybe also thriller component here. There aren't many moments where you will smile and probably not a single moment during which you will laugh. The absurdity of this cute dog (I love huskies!) carrying the virus though and how we see it sitting/lying there peacefully on several occasions was one of the (to me) lighter moments because such a contrast between the dog's kindness and what was really going on inside him. The first escalation really happens when the dog is together with the other dogs and basically transforms. And from that moment on, also with everybody from the crew witnessing that, the tension is there from beginning to end.However, this is not one of these films during which we have a character die every ten minutes. On the contrary. We do have people dying early on too. I mentioned the Norwegian and there's one or two other crew members infected and killed by the beast. By the thing. But basically everybody is still alive before the big final sequence in which they really go all in. This is where (almost) everybody dies though. In-between, it is also about suspense and coonflicts between the crew about who could be infected and we see how they do not trust each other at all. The best example is when they stand up against Russell's character because they think he is the one who carries the thing inside him. We never know. Unfortunately, this also resulted in some cringeworthy and gimmicky moments. Honestly, there were parts during which the dialogues and delivery felt really hammy. I cannot deny it. It's not (just) Russell, but the other cast members and you can see why almost none of those became truly successful actors and really famous in the long run. In general, this is a film that goes over the top on too many occasions for my liking. I will not mention every example, but it was pretty bad for example during one scene when we see several (four?) cast members on the screen at the same time. And with what they say and how they say it. And then there is the idea that Russell's character may be infected because no way he in his human form could have managed something spectacular before with the temperatures out there. Or you can also take the chess computer scene and how Russell's character makes sure he wins in the long run after being defeated initially. That was admittedly still a bit funny. There were way worse alpha male moments later on. I guess this was actually meant in a funny way because this was long before the creature showed up at the polar station.What I liked about the film was a bit of the scientific aspect. The idea of the protagonists that they wanted to use their blood to mix it with other blood to find out if one of them is infected, even if the idea that the blood they stored there was contaminated and the suspense arising from it did not really win me over. But also the actual experiment by Russell's character then showing us he is not only the strongest, but also the smartest man in the room was one of the highlights the film had to offer. In addition to that, I also liked how the creature was depicted there. It was scary, yet felt pretty creative and for 1981, it was really convincing as well. Thumbs-up for that and a key aspect in the film's favor that had me decide in the end that the film deserves the positive recommendation. It was a pretty close call to decide after I watched this the other day to be honest. I was not really won over and there were definitely moments and sequences where I was in favor of two stars less than I actually gave it. The soundtrack is by the legendary Ennio Morricone by the way. I did not know that before either, but yeah he was not just very talented, but also very prolific and not everyone can be a winner. I did not like the soundtrack here too much. It felt pretty generic for a horror film movie and nothing stood out. Sometimes it was also too loud for my taste, but this may not have been his fault. The ending was another letdown. We have alpha male Russell (or I should say his character) survive and (surprisingly) he is not the only one there and he and his buddy just sit there now and wait basically. Also went a bit against the idea that was really shoved into our faces before that they will all die in the process and for the good cause of the thing being defeated. But Carpenter (or most of all his writers) did not pull through with that.So yeah, not much else to say here. I don't think the film has aged particularly well to be honest and I find it baffling that this is comfortably inside the imdb's highest-rated 250 films of all time. For me it is maybe among the best 250 films from 1982, certainly not from the 1980s and also probably not even from the first half of the 1980s. Could be that I lower my rating on rewatch at some point. But probably not. Another thing that caught my attention is how long hair for men was still a sign for masculinity back then. Russell gives us the vibe of a tough male lion here, especially when he executes another member of the crew who attacks him. There they tried to bring in some conflict of morals as we find out said crew member was not infected. Meh.. did not work out too well. But what I actually wanted to say is that if you look at Statham, Diesel, The Rock, Bruce Willis... and their hair, you see that perception there has really totally changed. Speaking of genders (yes, they do exist, sorry), this is also a really rare movie that did not have any female cast members. Well, except the computer voice. Admittedly, she was the only one able to defeat Russell's character on one occasion. Not too many female crew members either. For a new version, they would have squeezed one in for the sake of #metoo I guess. Bad enough. Even if I am curious now about the recent (but also not new anymore) film with a trio of actors I appreciate. One of them is a (stunning) female of course. That's it. Nice to see the husky from early on had a really, really long life affterwards and also made a return to movies a couple times. Oh and Carpenter also has a really tiny cameo in here. All in all, this film gets a thumbs-up, but far from an enthusiastic thumbs-up. Also the beauty of the Eternal Ice was missing completely, which disappointed me a bit. Probably because the film almost never played outside. The elaborations on (especially one character) going insane in the face of the situation was okay. Nothing less, nothing more. Go watch this film. But go for may other instead or only if you are a Carpenter fan/completionist. I was clearly underwhelmed here. Not even in my personal top2500 I assume. Oh and I was a bit surprised to see several Black actors in this rather small cast. Not a given for 1982. That's it now really.","

"gedikreverdi","14 July 2021","It's been almost half a century since it came out and it still holds up today. It was difficult for me to follow this many characters as it was a crowded crew so for me it was more like McReady (Kurt Russel) and the other guys. The most epic scene was of course when the guy was performing CPR on a man and his body opened like a mouth and severed his arms and after he's burnt with the flamethrower, his head fell to the ground unburnt and turned into a giant spider-like creature. Blair who was locked up in the store shed was found to build another spacecraft like the one Norwegian crew found under the ice. The blood samples was being heated with a copper wire to see who's an imitation and one of the guys turned into a giant monster and that scene was really good too. Blair the old guy that was locked up wore the face of one of the three last surviving guys like a glove. Child one of the black guys and McReady were the last survivors after burning down the entire base so that the thing could not stay alive and they did not know if any of them is also an imitation.","

"lee_a_scott","7 October 2006","I saw this for the first time this morning. Obviously I'd heard of it years ago, it being generally held as a classic and all, but had somehow never had the opportunity to watch it until I was loaned the DVD. Not being a massive fan of John Carpenter's work (Michael Myers and Snake Plissken don't really impress me) I wasn't expecting much, without even considering the 80s music and effects. However, in honesty, I was pleasantly surprised. Whilst too many years have passed for the effects to scare or horrify, they at least manage to stay the right side of laughable, so there was no unintentional comedy. The cast was well chosen and stuck to their jobs, and the film was pleasingly bleak and effective. I am not sure that it is quite the classic that I'd been led to believe (maybe you had to see it in '82?) but it is a good solid movie, and worth a watch for anyone else who has gaps in their film history.","

"Prismark10","16 September 2016","John Carpenter remade Howard Hawks 1951 sci-fi film, The Thing From Another World.The film starts in the icy plains of Antarctica as a man in a helicopter is try to shoot dead a runaway dog. The dog survives as it reaches a base where some American scientists reside, the Norwegians in the helicopter do not.The dog is in fact The Thing, a being from outer space that arrived in a space ship some 100,000 years ago and remained buried in the ice in Antarctica. It looks like the Norwegian base camp uncovered it to their cost. The Thing can ingest and then assume the form of any living being whether human or animal.In some ways John Carpenter's film is similar to Alien as the members of the base camp will be knocked off one by one, not helped that they seemed to be left alone or go out on their own too many times so they can be taken over by the shape shifting creature.The film actually starts out slowly and the characters are painted in broad strokes, in short thin characterizations. There are no female characters in this film but there are two black actors in the cast, one rather stereotypical who seemed to have walked in straight from the hood listening to Stevie Wonder. Rather a few of the characters including star Kurt Russell did not convince me that they were research scientists.What the film did have was gross out special effects that would had scared the hell out of people in 1982, it certainly scared me in that era. Stretchy body parts churned inside out, gore galore, hands being severed, a head sprouting legs and walking off like a spider.What you get in grotesque special effects you lose in a coherent narrative. The film failed at the box office when the film was released but later acquired a cult following.","

"Amohrman25","17 July 2019","This is easily one of my favorite movies. The building dread throughout and the acting are all great. The way ever character is written and the uncertainty played throughout is great. The practical effects are amazing and this movie is just all around amazing. I don't fully know what else to say about it, it's just an amazing movie with so much ambiguity. I could watch it again and again. Even through the slow parts of the movie, it picks back up shortly after so it's not that noticeable. Even though this is a remake of The Thing From Another World (1951) it's great and not really a remake at the same time. I love this movie.","

"elizabethdawson-78805","6 December 2018","What can I say about John Carpenter's magnificent The Thing that has not been said already? It is a masterpiece of suspense, paranoia and dread. . Why does the film work so well you ask? The setup is standard stuff, establishing that the characters are isolated and can expect no help from the outside but it is the realization there could be an alien among them, and any one of them might not be human, is what launches The Thing into a spiral of escalating tension. The quest to identify the alien consumes about half the movie's running time, and includes several red herrings and the gripping blood test sequence in which MacReady uses a hot wire and samples of everyone's hemoglobin to clear some members of the crew and damn others. The final confrontation with the alien, despite providing the most grotesque special effect of the movie and allowing plenty of pyrotechnics, is anticlimactic. Then again, after the extended suspense of the middle section, it's hard to see how any resolution could rise to that level. This is great filmmaking and the Thing came during Carpentar's most fertile period as a filmmaker. Kurt Russell shines as do the rest of the all male cast. If you enjoy horror, suspense or thrills than this movie, more than thirty five years old is unmissable.","

"heinigrunbaum-786-20424","20 August 2016","So initially I wrote this (kind of) short review:Though I love E.T. (also at the time) The Thing was the thing for me, absolutely 100% Where E.T. today feels more like a Muppet Show (the plastic like E.T. is no longer as believable has he was in the 80s) The Thing still holds up against time in a rare and wonderful all men cast and a Kurt Russell playing chess with a computer, having a long strong drink when needed. This is a man's and a big boy's movie. And for this reason alone no man should ever miss out on this film.Maybe John Carpenter felt under pressure and had a hard time making it (so I read somewhere). But looking back there is no doubt in my mind, now as then, that The Thing is a wonderful Masterpiece (big thumbs up from me).And that was the reviewBut IMDb need more words to accept a review, so therefore I will continue:When The Thing first came out I was already the biggest John Carpenter fan ever on planet Earth. So no wonder that I went for the first screening a Friday at 12:00 noon at the (at that time) second biggest screen in Copenhagen, Denmark (Palads cinema screening room 1). Dolby Stereo was still a new thing back then and when the film faded up in a hand held panoramic wide shot of the cold ice at the South Pole together with the heartbeat drum of Ennio Morricone the tense atmosphere was set and ready. I knew from the first twenty seconds of the film that I was about to watch a Masterpiece and I also knew that I wasn't going to be disappointed If you have never watch The Thing and there is a given chance (somehow) that you in the near future of your short life will have the chance to watch this Masterpiece on a big screen in a cinema, you should wait for this option rather than watching it on DVD or whatever digital media you can find. That is if you want to experience the initially Oomph that this film's first scene brings to its audienceIn any regards all big boys and men should see this MAN FILM !!!","

Strong cast, the effects are great for its time and it over all holds it's creepy atmosphere it set out to have. I would recommend this movie to any horror movie buff, that love the whole monster/alien theme. The Thing does it, and it does it well. I am pretty excited for the prequel coming out next weekend.

"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","5 January 2006","A seemingly harmless dog runs into an American research station on Anatarctica pursued by men in a helicopter, that seem to have lost their mind, and are intent on killing as if it were the some terrible monstrosity. The Americans have no choice but to kill the crazed men, but out of curiosity as to what caused their bizarre actions they go to their camp which is completely wrecked and containing a mysterious canister found in the snow. Unable to make much of the situation they go back and put the new dog into the kennel with one they already have and... horror, unlike no other, begins.The horror of the film is a mixture of sickening gore and eerie atmosphere that John Carpenter used in films like 'Halloween."" The two elements, under Carpenter's direction, work very well with literally frightening results and the ""thing"" of the title is an organism (for lack of a better word) to be reckoned with. It is virtually indescribable, even to one who has seen this film multiple times and that is what makes it so good. A similar film, 'Alien,' three years before this used the same formula or darkness and setting to create tension and the monster was also elusive, but here, the Thing isn't just elusive and predatory. After watching the film you should know what I mean.Essentially this film is a near perfect balance of psychological as well as visceral horror. The tension of the film is only equaled by the terrifying carnage and that, my friends, makes for one horror film that you cannot afford to miss. 10/10Rated R: graphic violence/carnage, horror, and profanity","

The 1980s version of ""The Thing"" is not only the best of all the works of John Carpenter but the best horror film of all-time, in my opinion. Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley are two among a research team in remote Antarctica. When a ""nearby"" Norweigan camp seems to have gone berserk, an investigation reveals that they had dug up an alien from outer space capable of absorbing and imitating any life form.

So, you can get high at the research station? And roller skate around it? Not very professional, indeed.Kurt Russell channels Escape from New York's Snake Plissken for John Carpenter who directed both films. How does Kurt's R.J. MacReady, who is the station's helicopter pilot, know everything and always have the right answer? MacReady wears the worst hat ever worn in the movies.Don't bother with this unbelievable farce.","

"mark.waltz","18 October 2023","One of the most graphic, disturbing and nightmare inducing horror movies ever made, this one's also a classic that horror film fans have to see and students of cinema history should watch as well. Maybe not on a full stomach though or when feeling queezy. Quite different than the 1951 version, it's one of several remakes of classic horror that did a good job modernizing, not a hit in its day, but definitely a classic 40+ years later.You won't look at dogs the same way again when you see what they can turn into when ""the thing"" gets ahold of them, and you'll pray for instant death for the human victims. Kurt Russell and Wilford Brimley lead a cast of great actors as a team of scientists way up north who encounter a dog infected by the alien creature or virus or whatever it is, mistakenly killing the Norwegian man trying to destroy it.From there, it's obvious that this is one of the deadliest, slimiest and creepiest film monster, obviously thriving on the pain it causes for its victims. The creature also thrives on the mistrust it creates, with survivors tested to see if they've already been infected, and when they test positive, the ugly matter that destroys from within makes itself angrily known. Gross out effects are disturbing, but they definitely serve a purpose, and that makes this one of the best horror movies of the 80's, and along with ""The Blob"", my favorite horror remake.","

In fact, of all of his attempts at the genre, this is the only one that stands out to me. It's just as impactful as it was forty years ago. I was six years old when this came out and even though it scared the ever-living bejeezus out of me, I would keep an eye on the weekly TV Guide to make sure that I watched every Showtime showing of this spectacular film. I was both enthralled and terrified by this amazing movie. If you're on the fence about watching it, just do yourself a favor and watch it... Alone... At night... In the dark. You'll never be the same. Most definitely my favorite movie of any genre of all time. No movie has been made that even comes close.

"LoneWolfAndCub","6 May 2006","John Carpenter's The Thing is an amazing (horror) movie. With an outstanding cast, unbelievable special effects, an eerie Antarctic setting and a creepy score, The Thing is one of my absolute favourites and one of the most gruesome, scariest horror movies made! After a group of Norwegian scientists uncover some sort of aircraft in Antarctica, a deadly shape-shifting alien escapes. A group of American scientists are also in Antarctica and soon enough the alien has found them and begins to wreck havoc on them as they each get more suspicious as to who is human and who is the Thing! This is a remake of the black and white The Thing From Another World. Although it takes more from the short story 'Who Goes There?' John Carpenter has created a timeless sci-fi/horror classic. The cast (Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Donald Moffat and Charles Hallahan) are great as the scientists who soon begin to turn on one another. The special effects are the highlight, though. They are outstanding and are much better than any CGI you'll see. They are sickening and not for the weak-stomachs out there. The score (although not done by Carpenter) is still very much like him, it is eerie and it sets the mood perfectly. The Antarctic setting gives the us a feel of isolation and the' can't escape' feel.Surprisingly, this didn't do well when released. Probably due to Spielberg's friendlier E.T. But today the cult status and fan base is huge and it's thought of as one of the greatest horror movies ever made. This is recommended for any fan of sci-fi, horror or Carpenter.5/5!","

"ibiiah","1 October 2023","I saw this when it was released in the day. I took my small children and they got scared so I took them to the hall of the theatre and explained, ""it's just makeup and paint"". They got it and weren't freaked out anymore by horror movies. This movie is 2nd favorite from John Carpenter...1st is In the Mouth of Madness. I know no one knows too much about this film but it's based on HP Lovecraft stuff.Oddly, I also saw the the original John Carpenter ""Halloween"" when it came out at the theatre and hated it. It just wasn't scary to me.Why do these reviews have to be so long? If you say what you wanna say...enuf.","

"kevin_robbins","21 March 2022","The Thing (1982) is a gem that's in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows a group of American researchers in the artic when a group of Norwegians mysteriously are seen chasing a dog and trying to kill it. When the Norwegians have no regards for the Americans and accidentally start shooting and injuring them in their pursuit of the dog the Americans take them down and take in the dog. It doesn't take long for the Americans to discover why the Norwegians wanted the dog dead...This movie is directed by John Carpenter (Halloween) and stars Kurt Russell (Big Trouble in Little China), Keith David (There's Something about Marry), Wilford Brimley (Cocoon), Charles Hallahan (Dante's Peak), T. K. Carter (Domino) and Donald Moffat (Popeye).This is one of the top 5 horror movies of all time in my opinion. This is a brilliant blend of science fiction and horror elements. The characters are also outstanding and the cast is perfectly selected. The special effects were way ahead of its time with some great transformation and kill sequences. The dog cage scene, the spider human head, the defibrillator sequence, the blood testing scene...there's just too many good scenes to list them all. The ending is also brilliant.Overall this movie stands the test of time as one of the greatest horror and science fiction pictures of all time. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.","

"CinemaSerf","3 November 2022","As remakes go, this is one of the better ones that I have seen - though I still prefer the degree of menace generated by the 1951 iteration. A man in an helicopter is shooting at a lonely mutt amidst the antarctic wilderness when it arrives at an American scientific base. An accident ensures the inhabitants cannot interrogate the pursuing Norwegians and a quick visit to their nearby camp shows that disaster has struck. A large block of hollowed out ice suggests, though, that they may well have made an unique discovery - especially when they find some smouldering skeletal remains. Back at their own camp - along with their new charcoaled find - things get back to normal until the mysterious dog is put into the cage with the others and all hell breaks loose. It is soon clear to ""Mac"" (Kurt Russell) that they are dealing with something extremely strong, adaptable and ruthless. Can they survive? The visual effects here go a long way to compensating for the rather lacklustre acting - Russell isn't really very good - and the claustrophobic antarctic settings and howling winds add a richness and sense of peril to this superior horror story. The fact that the creature has a sort of Azazel-like ability to transfer from any life-form to another, and to more than one simultaneously adds some decent jeopardy to the plot, too, as neither they nor us know who is to be trusted right until the ending. This is certainly one of John Carpenter's better efforts - and is well worth a watch on a cold winter's night!","

"lindsayholloway","10 September 2023","I've loved this movie since first watching it back in 1985 and have watched it easily over 50 times since then. I would probably watch it once per month even today if my wife could handle it!It's the ultimate in claustrophobic paranoia and never fails to stir my emotions. The pace, editing, direction, performances and creature effects are all top notch. Even though I know exactly what's going to happen next in every scene I can still feel the anxiety rising in me beforehand. In typical Carpenter style, the ending is so ambiguous that over the years I think I've probably imagined 10 different scenarios of what happens next.The critics at the time have been proven wrong (surprise!) as it has become a true classic of the genre and my love for it only grows with each watching. It remains to this day the greatest horror movie ever made, in my honest opinion.","

"bkoganbing","20 October 2016","Even with John Carpenter's dazzling special effects this updated version of The Thing lacks a lot of the pizazz from the 1951 Cold War classic. This however is truly a thing as opposed to James Arness's plant man from 1951.It also takes place at the other end, the bottom of the world. Kurt Russell and others are on a scientific outpost there when they come upon some remains of something they can't quite identify.As I said it's not the plant man of the first film. Instead it's like a parasite invading the human or at first canine hosts which are the expedition's sled dogs. After a while the humans don't know who has been taking over.Lots of elements of both the Alien franchise and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers present in this film. But it doesn't hold a candle to my favorite plant man.","

A group of people that are intelligent and act in intelligent ways. A truly amazing horror film. Stands head and shoulders above most movies in the genre. It has just the *perfect* amount of 80s cheese, without being campy.Perhaps I am biased as I love the snow. If the cold frightens you this movie will really play into that fear. The characters are great. Only dig I could give it is that it should've had a few women in it. Other than that this worth watching for the practical effects alone.","

"EmperorNortonII","14 February 2004","John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is a shocking horror movie.  The special effects may not be up to par compared to what is possible in movies today, but there are still chilling elements.  For one thing, Ennio Morricone's intense score sets the creepy tone, with chords that suggest a pulse or a heartbeat.  Then the scene in which the men's blood is tested to see if any one of them had been infected by the Thing, that will shock you.  Beneath it all is a study in paranoia.  Who can you really trust?  This just might haunt you more than anything else about the movie.","

"bigdeb48-77-274140","14 October 2022","This is John Carpenter's best syfy horror movie of all his horror movies. The thing by John Carpenter has the scariest moments that I relish. While I've been watching all his movies, It's the best one and very imaginative, if you're into original syfy horror this film is at the top of the horror genre. I can't describe what is happening it would be a spoiler ultimatum. I just highly recommend that you watch it. Lock your doors and windows because your dog might not be what you think it is. Thats all I'm gonna say. And you're welcome. Lol you'll love to be scared out of your wits. It's in the artic, at a science research center, and the scientists come in contact with a harmless looking German shepherd. But it's not as harmless as it looks. This movie contains a shape shifting organism that happens to be an alien organism. And the scientists are trying to figure out what or who it will shape shift into what next. Everyone of the scientists suspects each other of being this organism but it isso convincing at imitating every living thing it's hard to figure out who is next to be it's victim.","

"Aaron1375","29 August 2011","This film to me is the best horror film John Carpenter ever did, trumping another great ""Halloween"". What he did in remaking a 50's science fiction movie into a super horror movie was just genius. The story has these guys (and it is all males, not a female to be seen) at some sort of research facility in Antarctica, I think. They discover something that has been removed from the ice at another facility, having been led there after witnessing a helicopter chasing after a dog with the purpose of killing it. Well they explore the base and take said dog back to their base, which in turn leads to some thing moving about the facility. It seems to infect or take on properties of those it kills, it is kind of hard to say, but when you find it out it goes all out to defend itself making for some of the most gruesome special effects you have ever seen. I love the scene with the shock pads and the head, who can forget the head? The movie also has such tense moments as you do not know who could be the thing and the group of dwindling survivors gets more and more nervous and paranoid as their numbers go down. The monster effects would inspire a lot of horror movies and games, just look at the recent ""Dead Space"" video game for things that look like they came straight out of this movie. This movie would also be Carpenter's greatest movie, looking at this one wonder's how he could have made a movie as bad as ""Ghosts of Mars"". This is also one of Kurt Russell's best roles as well, he and Carpenter always make a good team and this movie makes for a good night of fear, suspicion and gore. The thing could be anywhere...or be anyone!","

A great movie does both.This is a great movie.As iconic as some of the scenes are for their shock and gore (the defibrillator paddle scene is one of the greatest in film history IMO) you forget how tense the drama builds as these men are isolated in Antarctica till spring convinced that one or more of them could be a thing. The blood test segment is the climax and it's just superb.Everyone involved in this film did tremendous work. From John Carpenter (who is one of the top directors of all time IMO) to the cast led by Kurt Russell and Keith David (what that voice!!!) in his major film debut.One last thing about The Thing - the special effects are amazing. In our day and age of CGI it's hard to wow an audience anymore (because visually, everything is possible now). But I remember seeing this movie in the theaters (1982) and being BLOWN AWAY by heads splitting open and growing legs and crawling across the floor.","

"dworldeater","9 February 2015","Kurt Russell and John Carpenter collaborate again in this frostbitten masterpiece of extraterrestrial terror. Kurt is the lead and the film contains an excellent ensemble all male cast. In this horror/science fiction story and sausage party, our cast and film makers deliver the goods. They are a twelve man research team in Antarctica and have discovered that a shape shifting alien is capable of imitating anything and infects and imitates its host. If it reaches civilization, it could mean the extinction of all life on planet Earth. The special f/x by Robert Botin are state of the art and truly remarkable. The tone of the film is stark, apocalyptic and dead serious. The atmosphere is cold and tense, enhanced to great effect by Ennio Morricone's brilliant score. Performances by the cast are very solid and another one of my favorite actors Keith David also appears and gives our lead, Kurt some competition as alpha male of the show. Keith David also worked with John Carpenter on They Live, another classic and huge favorite of mine. This was the first film which John Carpenter refers to as his apocalypse trilogy. The three films have nothing to do with one another, but deal with a potential end of the world situation in different ways. The other two films are Prince Of Darkness and In The Mouth Of Madness which are both very good as well. The Thing is one of his best films and you can feel the coldness and isolation as this group of men struggle for survival on this Antarctic glacier. Great winter viewing and goes down even better for yours truly with some hot chocolate and sponge candy as snow rapidly falls.","

"Danielpotato","23 December 2016","The film's proposal is similar to Alien's (1979) proposal: a group of people have contact with an alien being, someone gets infected and then it's a hunting game between cat and mouse.What I like about movies in the 80's is that filmmakers do not waste time with unnecessary things and go right to the point. There is no mystery here. A human among the group gets infected and the group has to know who became infected.Killing the Thing in the process, it is therefore necessary. Unlike Alien, The Thing tries to create an atmosphere of mistrust in the team, and this raises doubts, creating for this a great aspect in the narrative of the film, to see the human distrusting of each other between the group companions raises the tension to the limits. The tension of the film is constant and the characters are friendly enough so we want to know about them. Be concerned about their fate is good enough to care about these characters.The filmmakers do not try to put any political messages, nor do they want to manipulate the audience. It's a great and straightforward horror movie with sci-fi to mix. It is a survival movie at its best. Unlike Arrival, who tries to pass the message that we have to unite (all nations), otherwise We will not survive. There is something greater here in this movie. A great movie to have fun in the sense of the old B-movies, but also it does not forget that our most basic instinct is survival and when we unite, forgetting our differences (as a group of Individuals, not nations), for the sake of our survival and our well-being, the human race shines in the most intense sense possible. The cooperation between several elements, to come out alive from a complicated situation. No political messages or no unnecessary melodramas (aka Interstellar).I just think the ending was a bit rushed, and needs some more focus on the final elements (characters) of the group. But the filmmakers went straight into the action and the big explosions, unlike Alien, where the tension accelerates to the very end and never stops. On the contrary it accelerates and increases. In this case, I consider Alien a superior film to The Thing (1982). Nonetheless, this movie is still a great horror movie with sci-fi elements, which makes it a great survival film. It's a great film to have some fun.","

"thesar-2","27 September 2016","If Man is a predator, and he is, and there's a prequel to this rebooted Antarctica-based movie also named 'The Thing,' isn't this also another Antarctica-based prequel to a rebooted movie named 'Alien vs. Predator?' Mindblown.Not really, but they do say imitation is the greatest form of flattery. Ba-Da-Bum, thank you I, or whoever copies me, will be here all week.They also say this is the best remake of all-time as well as the best horror movie of all-time. While I disagree with both statements, it's still one helluva good movie. It's essentially 1979's Alien on Earth, but less concentration on the characters. Where Ridley Scott's movie really defined the victims in space, this one was all-but a slasher movie where very few of the men (and yeah, only men) had enough personalities to distinguish them to remember their names. Sure, I recognized some of the actors from other films, and the always-excellent Kurt Russell stood out, most of the researchers were just body counts.The movie revolves around said researchers segregated in the Antarctic when the title character shows up to replicate anything it comes in contact with. Paranoia ensues between both the men and the audience on who is ""The Thing"" and who is for real. One by one, they're taken apart, sometimes literally and it's up to the strong and smart to outthink the THINGNow, I've seen this movie before many years ago and more recently, I saw the prequel in 2011. I liked both, and still have yet to see the original from 1951. I can imagine the original's total camp from that sci-fi, alien vs. the world-era. In addition to so many things I liked about this movie was the (I suspect) homage in the opening credits where a generic flying saucer, or U.F.O., comes crashing down on Earth. So cheesy in an otherwise incredibly inventive and ahead-of-its-time feature. Nicely done, Mr. (Director) Carpenter. I know the background. I know this was Carpenter's pet project since he made my personal favorite horror movie, 1978's Halloween. I also know they made the entire set themselves – prettydamnimpressive. So kudos to Carpenter and gang for such a remarkable and non-modern, CGI-feat. We don't get real filmmaking like this today and I, like most film- buffs, miss terribly. Sure, CGI is most cost-effective, it's just not as effectivevisually.While the two biggest issues I had with the film upon my initial viewing was the paranoia – ""Who Is The Thing?"" got kinda tedious (until they straightened that out) and at times, they seemed to be making things up as they went along (i.e. What Special Creature Effect Can We Come Up with Next,) the enormously original ending, or last few frames, made up for any shortcomings from my own end. LOVED THE ENDING. Overall, it's an absolute classic and refreshing to revisit from time to time. Completely timeless, it can be seen many years from now and still have the same effect as it had almost 35 years ago upon its initial release. This well paced, tense and never boring film is completely recommended for not just horror buffs, but movie-lovers, as well.***Final thoughts: I have to find that YouTube video again. I remember seeing a review of this in which they showed a bunch of comparisons to the original and made fun of how many doors the characters entered through. Now thatwould be a fun way of (mostly) watching the original without having to put up with cheap, early 50s FX.","

"ugothereur-548-496417","4 October 2021","Maybe they're sick of CGI and fine the film's first rate practical effects refreshing? Could be, but the truth is all the criticism The Thing received in1982 is still valid. Messy, muddled scripting. Unfocused direction, lethargic editing and scoring, and unsympathetic characters make it impossible to create any real suspense. The effects are the star, and that never nade a Transformers movie worth watching. The best scene in The thing is the blood test sequence, and that's because the cutting of the fingers was simple and identifiable. It was human unlike the characters and certainly unlike the film.Dean Cundey's photography and Rob Bottins practical effects are brilliant, to bad they were surrounded by mediocrity in the other departments.Stick with the 1951 original. It's superior film. One in which you'll care about the characters and real suspense ( not repulsion) is on display.","

Characters are very interesting and you feel like you know everyone and that each one has his own special place and duties in the movie.Atmosphere is what gives the movie a leg up on many many other movies. Many have commented on that before.I wanted to add that what in my opinion gives this movie a very slight edge over Alien is that it is not as claustrophobic. Not everything is confined inside the buildings all the time. Action steps outside a little which feels like danger is not as controlled and might actually get out of there.Another thing is that since the action happens on Earth, albeit on a very remote place, it seems like horror could have an immediate, quick and devastating effect on the entire population. It feels defenitely more humane and natural than the Alien movie.","

"ferbs54","3 June 2020","It is a debate that my buddy Jack and I have been having for decades now: Which is the better version of ""The Thing""? The original classic from 1951, actually entitled ""The Thing From Another World"" and directed by Christian Nyby (and, it is conjectured, Howard Hawks), OR the 1982 remake directed by John Carpenter? People who know me, and of my love for all things pertaining to 1950s sci-fi, as well as my dislike of unnecessary remakes, will perhaps be surprised to learn that I have always been the champion of the latter film. The original, I have long maintained, is a slow-moving, overly talky affair that is only sporadically punctuated by a few bursts of excitement. Its overlapping dialogue, although realistic, is often incomprehensible, and its central monster something of a letdown, as played by James Arness with clawed hands. But perhaps my central attack on the film is the fact that it is hardly in keeping with John W. Campbell's terrific novella of 1938, ""Who Goes There?,"" on which it is based. Campbell's Thing was a shape-shifter that could assume the identity of any person who it assimilates, and his tale was one of intense paranoia, with none of the men in the Antarctic station near where the Thing had crash-landed sure of any of his fellows' true identity. The original film threw out that shape-shifter angle and instead turned the Thing into a vegetable humanoid; a ""walking carrot,"" as one of the characters calls it, which for me has never been nearly as frightening a proposition. My opinion of the '51 film, to be fair, was ticked up a notch recently, when I got to see it on the big screen in a brand-new print that both heightened the visuals and made those overlapping sentences easier to follow. And to be honest, that original film still does contain two scenes that are amongst the very best of '50s sci-fi: the one in which the scientists form a circle about the perimeter of an alien spaceship buried in the ice, and the closing scene, with one of the characters telling us to ""Keep watching the skies."" Still, there is that walking carrot. Anyway, my feeling has long been that Carpenter's remake, which does indeed present the Thing as a shape-shifter, is both far more intense and closer to Campbell's vision. I had only seen this remake once before, with my buddy Big Al on a stormy afternoon, at home, back in the late '80s, but had never forgotten its power. And a recent rewatch has only confirmed for me which film is the superior shocker.Carpenter's film opens with a most memorable sequence, as two men in a Norwegian helicopter pursue a Malamute sled dog across a snowfield in the desolate Antarctic, firing at it with a shotgun all the while. Their pursuit ends in disaster when they finally land at the Americans' National Science Institute, Station 4, with its 12 male occupants. One of the Norwegians is killed when he attempts to chuck an explosive at the fleeing mutt, while the other is shot down by the station's commanding officer, Garry (Donald Moffat), in the belief that the Norwegian has gone mad. The poor mutt is taken in by the Americans and placed in a kennel with other dogs...a big mistake, as it turns out. Before long, that mutt is seen to slowly and horribly change, absorbing its fellow canines and morphing into some kind of alien monstrosity. It is quickly flamed out of existence and later autopsied by the group's biologist, Blair (Wilford Brimley). The station's chopper pilot, MacReady (Kurt Russell, who had already appeared in Carpenter's cult classic Escape From New York and would go on to star in his Big Trouble in Little China and Escape From L.A.), and the station's doctor, Copper (Richard Dysart), fly to the Norwegian base and find it deserted, except for an incredibly yucky-looking humanoid who looks to have been burnt to a cinder. Before long, and after discovering the remains of a crash-landed spaceship that had been buried for 100,000 years in the ice (yes, a scene that rivals the one in the '51 film), the truth becomes apparent: What they are dealing with is an alien shape-shifter who can assimilate any of the men on base and replicate them perfectly. Can any of the men trust any of the others now? Who is a genuine human, and who an alien monster? And there are more dire matters to consider, as Blair discovers. If allowed to reach civilization, this Thing, within 27,000 hours, could conceivably take over all life on Earth....The promotional poster for the remake of ""The Thing"" proclaimed it to be ""The Ultimate In Alien Terror,"" and Carpenter & Co. surely do bust a literal gut here to make the film a horror to behold. The special FX by Rob Bottin (who had worked on Carpenter's ""The Fog"" a few years earlier) are truly remarkable; both disgusting to look at and fascinating to behold. And indeed, this is surely not a film for the squeamish, the viewer being treated to such visuals as an arm being stitched in close-up, a shotgun blast to the face, that horrible-looking corpse at the Norwegian station and the intensely gross autopsy of same, finger slittings, and, most famously, the ""chest chomp,"" in which Copper's arms are bitten off by the alien creature as he performs a defibrillation on what he had believed to be a fellow human. Every manifestation of the Thing is both horrible and hypnotic to behold; you will not believe when the creature's stomach starts to sprout mouths, or when the head of its latest victim sprouts spider legs and begins to crawl away! Carpenter's direction is typically intense; the script by Bill Lancaster (whose only other screen credits are for two of the Bad News Bears movies, of all things!) is taut and no-nonsense; the film's score by the maestro, Ennio Morricone, is atmospheric and memorable; and the cinematography of the picture by Dean Cundey (who had already worked with Carpenter on both ""Halloween"" and ""The Fog"") is just gorgeous to look at. Filmed in part in the Tongass National Forest in Juneau, Alaska and in Stewart, British Columbia, this film really does convince the viewer that he/she is in the frozen Antarctic. The film is what the Campbell novella originally set out: a self-contained crucible of intense paranoia and mistrust. And it is never more intense than in the scene in which the men, to ascertain who is what, submit to a blood test; a scene taken straight out of the Campbell work. In the film, as MacReady takes a heated wire and dips it into each blood sample, the viewer waits in tense expectancy. And when MacReady finally does dip that wire into the alien blood sample, the viewer will most assuredly jump out of his or her seat. It is a supremely well-done scene, followed by an appallingly horrific sequence of events, and this segment of the film alone easily excels any single scene in the original film for intensity and scares. The Thing here is a true monstrosity, hardly a walking vegetable, and whereas the 1951 picture would dish out maybe two scenes in which the men confront their alien menace, the 1982 film gives us many, including a socko and explosive conclusion. Kudos to Kurt Russell here, for his terrific portrayal of the icy MacReady, and to the filmmakers who decided, after much back-and-forth deliberation, to end their film on a note of distrust and uncertainty.""The Thing,"" after its June 25, 1982 release, proved to be only a fair performer at the box office, pulling in around $20 million after being produced for $15 million, but to be fair, it had a lot of competition in the theaters that summer. ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" had been released the month before, and its cute and cuddly alien would help turn it into a box-office megasmash. On June 4th, ""Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan"" had been released, to the great delight of all Trekkers everywhere. And on that same June 25th, Ridley Scott's future cult item ""Blade Runner"" was released, as well. Of those four films, ""The Thing"" would result in the most critical lambasting, both for being an affront to the original and for its yucky visuals. But the years would be kind to it, and the film today is revered as something of a classic in its own right. And to be quite honest, I quite prefer it as a work of cinematic art over both ""E.T."" and ""Blade Runner,"" although hardly as much as ""Trek 2,"" which I still love to bits. This most recent watch of the remake has only confirmed my long-held belief that while the original film does have much to offer, talky and static as it is, Carpenter's vision is the one that I prefer. It is a film that puts the viewer through the proverbial wringer, and the after effects of watching it will linger for days. Yes, the 1951 picture got there first, and will forever be deemed, justly or not, as a classic (and no, it does not even crack this viewer's Top 10 Greatest Sci-Fi Films of the 1950s list), but the Carpenter film is the one with the power and the scares. It is one of the very few remakes that I find preferable over the original (another remake favorite of mine is the 1941 version of ""The Maltese Falcon,"" by the way), and that should tell you something....","

"evilasahobby","7 March 2003","Less than successful on release, ""The Thing"" is a horror film that really stands the test of time. Its special effects (which are key to the atmosphere of the film) haven't dated that badly at all and don't distract the watcher from the film with too much obvious ""fakeness"". That's not to say everything looks ultra-real, but given that two decades has passed since the original release, this movie has done pretty well.The major attraction to this film is its atmosphere. Stuck on an ice base with an alien that can impersonate anyone, a type of claustrophobic paranoia starts to take shape. This is aided that characters will disappear for long times only to reappear later and not all the action is shown - the audience is never quite sure who hasn't been contaminated.""They Thing"" is a seminal horror film that relies on tension rather than gore to draw the audience in. It's a pity that not more horror directors haven't learned from this film (and what's even worse is that Carpenter himself seems to have forgotten too!).","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","19 March 2009","This is a serious injection of pure paranoia. If you don't get anxious and ask important questions about what exactly happens that we don't get to see, and when, during the course of this, then you, my friend, were not properly engaged, and, let's be brutally honest here, this film probably wasn't meant for you(and hey, that's no problem, nothing is for everyone). A lot of debate is possible over the answers. And that's part of why this is so enormously terrifying, and what keeps this working for the audience, even with many viewings. It's difficult to be certain. The plot is marvelous, and its progression feels natural without being predictable. The concept is well-thought out, interesting and fascinating, and the execution does not disappoint. The pacing is spot-on, there is not a misplaced moment to be found in this. When this intends to be, it is rather intense. The atmosphere is expertly crafted, and builds at the proper speed, never rushed. The tension is so thick you can practically *see* it. The gore is plentiful, and while quite frightening, it isn't the point, nor does it ever feel like it is. And whether you like them or not, ya gotta admit, they look pretty darn good for when they were made. All the special effects in this do, almost entirely on account of Rob Bottin, the newcomer who literally exhausted himself creating them. The key is the balance, how far you push the shocks, and John's got that down to a science. The humor is of the same type and close to the same amount as his usual efforts. The acting is average or above. The characters are sufficiently developed and varied. The dialog is well-delivered and well-written. The mood is helped by the brilliant composer Ennio Morricone, who applies his talent, and puts together music that fits Carpenter perfectly. If your nerves are not in tattered rags before this is over... see the beginning of this review. All of these things together... the isolation of the people and the setting, the long, claustrophobic hallways, the genuinely successful scares, the gruesome violence and the haunting, unsettling score... it creates a strong horror piece which still holds up today, and which manages to get jumps out of yours truly, after having watched it around a dozen times. The DVD holds a feature-length behind-the-scenes documentary and a commentary track with Kurt Russell and the director, who are cool to listen to together, and which is both entertaining and informative. The menus are a tad flat, and one can tell that the release was done years after this hit theaters. I recommend this movie to fans of all that were involved in making it... in particular the man who helmed it. 9/10","

"AbhiMathews","26 October 2014","The Thing is certainly a creature to fear. Its transformation capabilities yield it one of the strangest yet most powerful weapons introduced to the horror genre. The vulnerability of a population of any size certainly makes the Thing a being with infinite (chaotic) potential and one to hold in high regard.From the eerie soundtrack to sharp moments, The Thing certainly has the inner workings of a classic. Despite the great technical qualities, I was generally unmoved by the film. Although the oddity and atmosphere in the Antarctic was entertaining throughout, it was rather dull than pure excitement.The haunting and supernatural plot combined with the scary scenes and chilling vibrations surrounding every movement ensure a moment should not be missed. But alas, it was simply not a movie for me.","

The movie leaves many hints on how the character was a Thing in the film. The special effects are incredible, the best in movie history. There, I said it!I HIGHLY recommend this masterpiece!",NA

Except for the guy who shot the foreigner through the window, they all could see how the foreigner wasn't after them, walking right past them with his rifle; he was after the dog. He'd even tossed the grenade away once he saw that the dog was around PEOPLE.",NA
"ChoiBaby","30 March 1999","A thoroughly enjoyable horror masterpiece conceived by the one and only John Carpenter (HALLOWEEN, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK). THE THING is a great horror movie with plenty of spine tingling chills, and much genuine suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. State-of-the-art special effects and make FX provided by Rob Bottin (ROBOCOP, TOTAL RECALL) help propel THE THING above the usual films of the science-fiction/horror genre.""The Thing"" has been discovered by a dozen explorers at the Arctic. They've made a startling unveiling of a mysterious life-form...but little do they realize the destructive capabilities of this creature. This alien creature is so malevolent that as it mutates, it assimilates the form of its nearest, most unlucky victim. Later, the creature masquerades itself as whatever the life-form it has consumed and deformed. The leader of this expedition, Kurt Russell (STARGATE, SOLDIER), must deploy the explorers into employing ways to stop this alien mutant before it's evil spreads into worldwide, global proportions.  However, as the toll rises, any one of Russell's colleagues...may in fact, be part of the demon already...THE THING is an engrossing horror film with some of the most grotesque special effects seen on the screen. The literally eye-popping effects include melting faces, cremations, walking heads, deformity, heads bursting out of stomachs, and other sequences too gruesome to print in words alone. THE THING though, has been sadly criticized by film connoisseurs as merely exercise of disgusting special effects.  In my sincere and humble opinion, THE THING is a film with more substance than what most movie critics have said.This film is a parable.  The expedition must learn to trust one another and stick together in order to essentially survive. Another interesting aspect about THE THING is that this movie shows what would happen if fear and isolation conquer a whole group.  The consequences are devastating, people end up fighting each other and debating violently, instead of trying to work together to alleviate the problem.  This film conveys a lesson saying that trusting one another and teamwork are the two main components for survival against the odds.  Without those two traits, then everything else, even technology itself...is meaningless...THE THING is a great movie to watch in the dark during midnight. You will be guaranteed to jump out of your seat at least a few times.  THE THING delivers its fair shares of shocks and jolts.Although the story-line in this film is not very efficient, it doesn't distract from the tension and suspense of this movie. If you enjoy truly frightening horror films with AWESOME special effects, then THE THING is a highly recommended movie perfect for you.WARNING: If you have a modicum of squeamishness inside you, then steer clear of THE THING.  Otherwise, get ready for an exciting and suspenseful presentation.  Plenty of effort integrated into this film, thanks to the direction of John Carpenter, and the believable performances of the main characters including Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart, and the rest of the cast.RATING: **1/2 out of ****.",NA
"jgreed-49807","18 August 2019","I have watched this movie on an average 5 times a year since 84/85. I can quote it, my dad does it a lot. ""Cut me loose"" or ""ill kill you"" etc. love this movie. The ending is awesome. Classic. The original 1950s version sucks, but the 82 version pays homage. The 2011 version was ok, no originality of its own however. But this 82 version was pure cinematic gold. How this film wasn't appreciated when it first premiered is beyond me. Thankfully my dad was a film aficionado and exposed me to this gem decades ago.",NA
"blanbrn","16 November 2018","Always been a fan of horror and sci-fiction movies, and plus almost always like the works of John Carpenter, finally watched this cult classic 1982's ""The Thing"". And I must say clearly not the greatest or far from the best of John's works, still it entertained for it's blend of suspense and finding the unknown.Certainly a different type of film the plot is set in the winter of 1982 in a Antarctic research station and things goes crazy when a helicopter fires and a dog is killed. All of this leads to the discovery of a creature who's been buried in the snow. And once discovered gore and blood like transformation is wrecked upon everyone as it's like life changing forms of the body! Look for some early work of Kurt Russell in this chiller.",NA

"davidmvining","31 August 2021","Wow, John Carpenter really loves Howard Hawks, doesn't he? Well, he was hired onto this project after it had been through several drafts, managing a new draft written by Bill Lancaster, and didn't originate the idea, at least. Still, what Carpenter helped script and ended up directing is an ideal remake. Returning to the ultimate source, the short story ""Who Goes There?"" by John Campbell, Carpenter recast the whole concept with a twist while firmly planting the new film in a new time, never feeling like he's just repeating what Hawks and Nyby had done before in The Thing From Another World.One of the key differences between Carpenter's remake and Nyby's original is in terms of its construction. The original starts away from the remote, icy camp and moves into that team finding the alien trapped in ice. The remake starts with the creature having already been dug up, torn apart a Norwegian camp, and arriving at the American camp with our heroes in the form of a dog. This is important for one big reason, the monster is incredibly different. In the original, there was just a monster (that apparently looked like a carrot in color) that needed defeating. In this remake, pulling more from the original source material, the monster is vastly different, able to morph from one shape into another as it absorbs the essence of other creatures. There's a lot of questions that arise about how it does it and how perfectly it can hide in its form, and the movie, having the refuse of a previous encounter to sift through, provides those answers on the front end of the film.The dog runs into camp, the final Norwegian dies by a gunshot to the head, and Mac (Kurt Russell), the helicopter pilot, flies to the Norwegian camp to investigate with a couple of others. There, they find the half-burnt remains of something. There are distinct signs of human appendages and two heads melting into or away from each other. This is obviously not human, and we get a scene where Blair (Wilford Brimley), their biologist, dissects it, finding perfectly normal human organs inside. This is telling us that whatever this thing is, it's not human and it will look human down to its organs. There will be no telling it apart from anyone else. It's great that this information is introduced early because once the questions about who might or might not be the creature, we're not bogged down with questions of how. We already know that.The dog wanders the enclosed hallways of the camp for a day, and there's something to be said about the dog's performance. I guess I wouldn't have thought of this if I hadn't had my most recent watch of this film with my visiting mother (the movie was her idea) who noted it as we were watching, but there's an eerie quality to the dog. It's too calm, collected, and still to be real. How it steadily wanders the halls, eventually choosing a room to go into, or how it stands perfectly still at a window looking outward is off-putting. Anyway, after a day roaming the camp, Mac tells the dog handler Clark to put the dog with the rest, and things go pear shaped quickly. Alone with the sled dogs, the creature changes shape into an amorphous set of tentacles, jaws, and flesh, spraying dogs with liquids, grabbing them and absorbing them while chaos erupts.This points to another of the film's great attributes: the creature effects. Done by Rob Bottin (with some work by Stan Winston), the creature work is amazing. The wide variety of manifestations of the creature represent months of work, and there's a fleshy, other-worldly quality to all of it that unites them as one. Everything changes from one situation to the next, but they all feel like they're part of the same thing at the same time. My favorite is the variety of effects that make the head independently crawl away from the burning corpse. So well done and creepy.To get to that moment is a series of steadily increasing doubts that each man has about everyone else around them. It becomes obvious that no one can truly trust each other, especially after the doctor proposes a blood test that would identify the creature and the store of blood gets sabotaged. No one knows who does it, but suspicions are directed in some specific directions at the same time. An admirable element of all this is that we, the audience, are completely in the dark about who is or is not the creature, as much as anyone else in the movie, and it never feels like a lie. It never feels like Carpenter is artificially keeping information from us, even though we see the moment that leads the dog to infect the first person in the camp but we can't see who it is. It never feels like a lie to us. Instead it feels like we're reaching the edges of perception based on point of view that's pretty solidly set in the film. Most of it is told directly from Mac's point of view, though we do move in and out of it here and there, and it never feels like a cheat.That lack of clarity about who is who is the ultimate source of tension in the film. We're never sure if anyone can be trusted, and there are moments where we even begin to wonder about Mac, even though we've walked most steps along with him. The centerpiece of creating clarity amidst the confusion is the blood test scene where Mac takes blood samples of everyone and uses a hot needle to see if the blood will react violently in response. It's an amazingly tense sequence because we honestly have no idea what's going to happen. One of them, at least one of them we figure, has to be a creature, and we don't know who. We also don't know how its blood will react or how it will react if exposed. It's also remarkably cleanly filmed, providing a very clear sense of geography around the room that helps to hide some of the special effects when they pop up.There's a remarkable professionalism to the filmmaking in general here. That's a way of saying that this movie simply looks great. There was something about the generation of filmmakers that came about in the 70s that gave them this great combination of old school aesthetics with new school sensibilities. Like how Coppola's The Godfather is rather perfectly framed from beginning to end but focused on a more grounded, dirtier, and more detailed violence than gangster movies of the past, Carpenter's The Thing has the roving Steadicam shots of a new filmmaker while framing several men in small spaces without every losing sight of the focus of the scene, helping to keep the variety of men separate in our minds. This extends into the special effects sequences where the detailed puppets are filmed in the perfect light to keep them looking real and terrifying at the same time.And what do I think of the ending? Both are human and are going to die a very cold death. They won, and they will die heroes in the cold.",NA
"Darth_Osmosis","25 May 2018","The best sci-fi/horror movie I have seen! The U.S. outpost in Antarctica provides a great setting, isolation and cold create a perfect atmosphere for this kind of film.

The ending is really good!",NA
"ElMaruecan82","3 May 2018","In ""Night of the Living Dead"" (spoiling paragraph), the lone survivor ended up being shot as randomly and mercilessly by a posse gunman who didn't even give him time to say ""I'm not like them!"". The guy looked like a racist asshole but we can ask ourselves if the emergency or the pressure were too big to take a chance. One of the most wicked aspects of John Carpenter's ""Thing"" is to make the gunman's point in a way that brilliantly betrays our own inclination to distrust.It starts with a helicopter firing gun at a running sled dog in Antarctica, we can't sympathize with the shooter, and when the dog makes it to that camp, we're almost relieved. Then the helicopter lands, and the man with the rifle, a Norwegian, starts shooting again uttering incomprehensible words for the camp members, all American. Of course, he was warning them about the dog, but he didn't realize he was endangering himself and a bullet hit him before the realization. Garry (Donald Moffat) isn't your typical trigger happy guard but he didn't trust the Norwegian. This is distrust's establishing moment as the pattern-instinct that will drive the plot and command most actions.Lack of trust or refusal to trust... the merit of John Carpenter is to have brilliantly exposed one of humanity's most detestable traits in a powerfully metaphorical story brilliantly dressed up as a horror movie but closer to the spirit of the original novel ""Who Goes There?"". Indeed, to call ""The Thing"" a remake is an insult, if anything this film highlights the limitations of its predecessor. While in the black-and-white film, the all-clean-cut American team had all their members sticking together against a clearly identified Frankenstein-like enemy, here, you'd better not watch the skies but anyone around you, which is enough to fuel the atmosphere with pure paranoid terror.Literally, they had another ""Thing"" coming, the alien has no place to hide except for hidden organisms, which means dogs or eventually humans whose shape it can imitate and recreate. The original tag-line said ""Man is the warmest place to hide"" before it was stupidly changed to ""The Ultimate Thing in Alien terror"" milking on Ridley Scott's success while the film was a whole new experience by making humans the potential containers of the ugly creature. Carpenter reconciled between Scott and Romero's concepts with the background of the 1951 film more convincingly restored, and the result is both visually stunning and captivating. Even the cold and the solitude were powerfully rendered. Hell, even the dogs act well.Yet the film was criticized for its overuse of gory effects. Personally, I thought they were so spectacular and effective they should have beaten ""E.T."" (""The Thing"" wasn't even nominated) as if Spielberg reinvented the wheel after ""Star Wars"" or ""Close Encounters"". It's not just about the practical effects but the way the corpses and hybrid-versions of the Thing looked like real biological structures in their gruesome and grotesque way and pushed repulsiveness to eleven without undermining the realism. On the contrary, they made the original lose any credibility with its ""man in suit"" villain. The film was also criticized for its lack of characterization and this is why I have to play the devil's advocate again. Granted Kurt Russell plays the bad-ass hero with the right intuitions and the other cast members seem to fulfill a few archetypes, there's never a moment where the acting feels unrealistic, everyone is aware that they are in a situation where splitting up is the worst option yet the turns of events always force them to split up causing the suspicions to reappear, it's not contrivance, it's brilliance in a twisted way. And by the time Blair (an unrecognizable mustache-less Wilford Brimley) realized the apocalyptic implications of the Thing, it was too late, and even with a buddy-system, they couldn't trust each other under that eschatological pressure. It's easy to sit as viewers and be all analytical about it, but maybe some of us would have hidden in the safest place to avoid any contact, hence endangering ourselves even more. I think the film played it real enough so I could find it plausible... starting with defensive moves that enhance the danger and then strategies to sabotage the Thing's plan while leading to other tricky situations. And everything leads to that sequence where Charles Hallahan's belly literally snatches Richard Dysart's arms and the head turns to a spider-like monster, this scene is delightfully hideous, so is its enthusiastic retelling in the ""making of"" film. We've reached the film's high point and it's immediately followed by the blood test; perhaps one of the most riveting and suspenseful moments from any horror movie. It's not just in the outcome but the way eyes' glances and death glares are exchanged and when you see this scene a second time, you realize that the ""trusting"" issue is the spice that makes the meal so delicious. They don't want to trust each other but the most nightmarish aspect of their situation is that they must do it. And to close the ""trusting"" arc in the most satisfying way, you've got to love the final exchange between Russell and Keith David, when they realize that they've reached a point where trusting isn't an issue anymore and it's time to share a peace-pipe-like JB bottle. That scene might echo the perception the film received when ""E.T."" was praised for its more friendly visitor and universal message; but retrospectively, ""The Thing"" has just as much depth, as strong visuals, and if not the box-office gross of ""E.T."", it finally earned a wonderful afterlife elevating it among the classics of the genre... and deservedly so!",NA
"hamzaarifshuja","18 August 2023","The Thing is one of John Carpenter's best films, such a great achievement in special effects. Makes me wish films today were still this creative and practical without relying on too much CGI. The special effects look super gross and gnarly. The kills in The Thing are a thing of beauty, it is pretty frightening and holds up really well even by today's standards. The Thing is a great creature feature filled with tension and suspense. The movie builds slowly and creates a great sense of paranoia amongst the characters and has you guessing who is not human. Perfectly cast and love the setting in Antarctica. It's a pretty grim tale and isolating the characters in Antarctica makes their fates feel pretty hopeless. The drama in this is pretty compelling while Kurt Russell is the lead protagonist by no means is he a good guy and has flaws. This movie is about survival of the fittest and an all time classic.",NA
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","31 October 2009","If 1979's ""Alien"" was the original hypothesis that the best science-fiction thrillers are psychological, then John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is the study that proves it true. A remake of John W. Campbell Jr.'s 1951 classic ""The Thing from Another World,"" Carpenter's re- imagining is another brilliant execution of quiet suspense that gets quickly into your head and hooks into your brain.Kurt Russell, Carpenter's star from ""Escape from New York,"" takes the driver's seat again as one of a team of scientists living in Antarctica when a helicopter with two Norwegian scientists arrives at their facility trying to shoot down a husky. The Norwegians are killed and the husky lives, only the husky is actually an alien from another planet that survives by taking the identical appearance of the organisms it kills. Having had the dog in their possession for 48 hours, the men realize that any one of them could be a thing, causing a huge build-up of distrust and tension.The key part that makes ""The Thing"" stand above most other alien/creature/monster kills off a group of people one-by-one movies is that last bit about distrust. In other films, the creature is identifiable -- a shark, an alien, etc., but in ""The Thing,"" it could be any of the characters -- now that's both terrifying and awesome. Instead of a thriller where we're just curious about the gruesome way in which the creature will kill the next random dude, we get the simultaneous thrill of wondering which person the creature is. It's like rolling a mystery into a sci-fi horror film.The nice part about that dual entertainment is they feed off each other. While we're busy wondering who isn't human, Carpenter can fully utilize shock and awe when the thing actually does attack and boy, does he ever. The amount of prosthetics and mechanical devices used to create the constantly moving spool of guts mixed with slimy Venus fly traps that is the thing and the people its imitating are incredible. More than 25 years later you almost wish more films stopped pushing computer-generated images so hard and stayed devoted to developing better and better prosthetics. But can shear paranoia and suspense along with the fulfilled promise of excellent visual effects drive a science-fiction story? Apparently so. Russell is the only known actor and there's not a whole lot to the characters other than the way they deal with their fear and paranoia. Another less obvious reason ""The Thing"" works so well is the parameters the story sets up for itself. Carpenter and screenwriter Bill Lancaster establish a very specific set of rules for what the thing is and isn't capable of, even going so far as to show us the science of how cells from the thing devour other living cells. We know that the thing only reveals itself when its alone with its victim and that it is driven primarily by a survival instinct. These rules lend legitimacy to the story and make it much more interesting for the viewer trying to stay a step ahead of the plot.When it comes down to it, ""The Thing"" is just smart formula film-making, even though the formula arguably came after this film. It has a director with impressive horror and suspense credentials in Carpenter, who directed ""Halloween,"" one of the greatest film composers ever in Ennio Morricone to do the suspenseful, haunting score and a creature with more than meets the eye who wreaks psychological havoc on the characters and consequently, us. ~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",NA
"fernandoschiavi","24 April 2022","""The Thing"" (1982) is one of the greatest classics of the sub-genre of science fiction called Cosmic Horror, and one of the most acclaimed works of director John Carpenter. It can be considered at the same time a remake of The Arctic Monster (1951) and a readaptation of the short story Who Goes There? (1938) by John W. Campbell, the screenplay by Bill Lancaster follows an American research station in Antarctica that is threatened by a strange alien parasitic species that assimilates living organisms and imitates them, creating an exact copy of it, thus generating an atmosphere paranoid of who is really human among those men.The film follows a group of twelve men in the remote Station 4 of the US National Institute of Science. After they shoot down a Norwegian helicopter that was trying to kill a dog, pilot J. R MacReady (Kurt Russell) offers to travel to the other base and try to find out what was going on. Upon arriving at the scene, he realizes that an alien capable of transforming into an exact copy of its victims is among them and everyone could be a possible threat.Allied to this, the director had a competent team that helped create the entire suspense scenario that the film carries since the beginning. Starting with the soundtrack by Ennio Morricone, which opens the film by introducing the tone of the story. The beat of the synthesizers, which soon mixes with the noise of the helicopter, helps to create a feeling of strangeness. When the public realizes what the shooter has in his sights, the mood is not one of action, but that something is wrong. This union between diegetic and non-diegetic sound, extends throughout the narrative, keeping the tension always high.The Thing is characterized almost as an exercise in genre, and naturally does very well in that sense with the sure direction of John Carpenter. There is no concern in developing most of his characters, since we see MacReady (Russell) from the beginning of the plot assuming the exclusive prominence of the story, when in the first sequence he is seen isolated from the rest of his team, and we realize his impulsive behavior, but also leadership, as basically none of the other men question his actions or his orders. Thus, the deficiency in the characterization of those people would not generate the well-known identification in the viewer, however, this is not what happens, since the script ends up betting well on the construction of paranoia and fear, curiously giving each character the same importance in given moment of the movie, since anyone can be the thing.The screenwriter Bill Lancaster's (""The Bad News Bears"") goal was to work the chaos - he wastes no time in building the conflict, which starts to affect everyone with just a few minutes of production - and to bring a minimum of depth while the plot. Advances. If it works on the one hand, it also makes none of the deaths-except that of the dog-have any more significant importance. The atmosphere of paranoia owes a lot to Dean Cundey's setting work. The filmmaker's well-known cinematographer - they had previously worked together on ""Escape from New York"", ""The Fog"" and ""Halloween"" - it is he who transforms the research base into a cramped and claustrophobic environment. The corridors narrow with the camera angles, and towards the last act they look more and more like a maze. In addition, close-ups help create the feeling that danger can be anywhere. Even with the dark corners continually appearing, Cundey doesn't hide the being, showing just how horrible the threat is.And it is precisely the creature that holds the visual tension of the film. The creation of then-rookie Rob Bottin, the monster is the essence of H. P. Lovecraft, which matches the film's aesthetic. The scene in which one of the team members is sucked into the belly of a contaminated companion put Bottin's name in the circle of special effects stars - in the following years he would start a partnership with Paul Verhoeven and be responsible for the makeup of ""Seven"". Here, he manages to synthesize evil as something that cannot be defined and helps the characters' continuous feeling of delirium.The film addresses themes of subjectivity and human relationship in a genre film. Films that, even using a usual theme that is invasion and alien possession, were not what people were looking for in cinema in 1982, the year of their release. In fact, the slasher was at its peak, with sequels to ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Friday the 13th"", films that were sensational at the time and were not concerned with existential questions. The film was not successful at the box office and with critics in the year it was released, largely because of the changes made by the director in view of the first adaptation of the short story, ""The Thing from Another World"", an American film from 1951. In the same year ""E. T"" was released, a much more commercial and family-oriented film, which ended up helping to take the focus off Carpenter's work. In 1982 Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" was also released, another film without much repercussion at the time, and, like ""The Thing"", gained a survival when released in the home video industry and today is worshiped by those who dare to watch.In the opening credits we see a spaceship crashing on a planet that looks like Earth, the date on which this happens is not specified. Right in the foregrounds, we are set in the snowy immensity of the desolate Arctic. We managed to have a very precise definition of space, this is important because this isolated environment will be essential in creating the feeling of despair and hopelessness that the film gives us. The director uses shots that lend themselves to showing the environment, and aligned with a dark and unusual soundtrack composed by Ennio Morricone, but with great influence from John Carpenter's synth horror, we have already identified this space as a threat in itself.The atmosphere of tension and discomfort that the soundtrack gives us takes on another dimension from the moment we get to know the characters who work at the station. The camera several times uses the dog - which was being chased in the opening credits - as a narrative tool following the premises and helping with the development of some characters. Even with the montage giving us a docile air of the animal, we remain apprehensive and questioning due to the initial scene in which the Norwegian helicopter chases it. From the initial incident, Windows (Thomas G. Waites), who appears to be a communications technician, tries to report what happened to the outside world but is unsuccessful. Meanwhile, MacReady (Kurt Russell) and Dr. Blair (Wilford Brimley) go to the Norwegian station in an attempt to get answers. They come across the abandoned and destroyed station. In a certain room they find a holed glacier, and soon determine that something may have come out of it. Among the bodies found, there is a strange, bizarre humanoid creature, here we can see an explicit example of how body horror will be used in the film. They take the disfigured body when they return to the American base, and after an autopsy, it is confirmed that it is a human.The film feeds the feeling of fear until we are introduced to the organism. The purpose of the unusual scene is to shock, whether by gore or gore. Practical and animatronic effects are used in most moments where we really see the creature in its multiple forms and bring some iconic and disturbing scenes to life. In most of the clashes and dialogues, paranoia is placed above the sense of collectivity, this is successfully conveyed by the direction and ambiguous performances. Due to the naturalness and closeness of the characters, we can see that they have been there for some time. But from the moment it is not known where the threat, the urgency and the will to survive the creature will come from, these relationships are put into play.With a very curious central theme - contact with the other can make me sick - and a good exploration of the threat in an environment that should offer security, Enigma from Another World is one of those films that hold us from beginning to end and leaves us horrified in several moments of its projection. The ambiguous ending, another hallmark of the filmmaker, is also present. And here, with a special touch of irony, which concludes without needing to close, opening parallels with the investigation at the beginning in the Norwegian base. The dialogue between MacReady and Childs in front of a bonfire and seeing the station on fire is uncomfortable and to some extent nihilistic. Not knowing which of the two is infected, they decide to wait and see what happens.The Thing is that feature that became a cult. Among its greatest qualities, the idea of a creature without a definitive face is surprising. After all, it manages at the same time to highlight to the viewer the danger and mistrust between all the characters. And when she does appear, her plastic effect of teeth, tails and tentacles is strong enough for a visual horror that bears a strong resemblance to the writings of H. P Lovecraft. Even being a remake of another feature from 1951, The film manages to create its own atmosphere that undoubtedly marks the feature. Also very well for the technical components, such as the direction and the closed environment, as well as the soundtrack, which insists on distressing and ""errant"" sounds during the narrative. John Carpenter's film is considered a cult classic today for all the impact it has had on the horror film industry over the years. With its practical visual effects that have become a great influence on similar works, its atmosphere of tension and for bringing a narrative that so well develops its conflicts.",NA
"one9eighty","27 July 2018","A great film, truly chilling and gruesome, a true work of horror with an element of sci-fi thriller thrown in! I remember this film from my youth and watching it recently I confirmed that that film knowledge (lines, scenes, etc.) never really went away - they just lie dormant in my mind waiting to be reanimated. The minute the film starts events are in motion, all the way through it, right until the second the credits roll. An alien parasite/monster has infected a human host and taken its body, wearing it like a shell or a mask and taken it for a walk. It manages to get into a US run, scientific station in the frozen wasteland of Antarctica. The American scientists are about to get cut off from society due to adverse weather condition - little do they know, of what is trapped in there with them - a shape shifting evil alien that can take on the form of its victims and shapeshift at will. The film primarily uses Kurt Russell as its vehicle and he puts in a great performance, as does the entirety of the cast for that. Stuck in a remote location with an unknown killer they all come across as authentic. The strength of this film has been proven time and time again. During the year it was released it bombed, people were more interested in ""E.T."" and nicer films. Fast forward ten years - this film still has a following, and it's grown too. Fast forward another ten years and yet more fans and followers, and the film is still adored. If film is art and all good artists are looking for their one masterpiece, then this cult film has to be John Carpenter's masterpieces. The chilling synth soundtrack, works, it's spooky and more so - with the film emerging the viewer in the action, its believable to think hat this is the only musical score we have access to when locked away in the Antarctica. When I started writing this reviews I swore that I'd never give a ten out of ten because that would indicate perfection, and to my knowledge and beliefs there are always things that could improve - with everything. This film however, pushes that believe to the limit. In its horror genre this scores damn high, when compared to films in other genre's too - this still scores highly! I'm going to write 9 out of 10 - but then I'm going to have to run away and take some deep breaths as this pushed my rating rationale to the limit. It may even have broken me for today - Film fans, you cannot go wrong watching this classic masterpiece - it still stands tall nearly 40 years later!",NA
"damjanraknic","22 June 2013","As a concept it's rather brilliant actually, but it's a shame that the idea never really goes anywhere. The film features a one trick pony with it's main antagonist being a shape-shifting alien that can take over a host in every way and if it evolves to a point it becomes completely indistinguishable from the original. The story quickly abandons any attempt at adding depth to this premise while thoroughly exploiting the scare potential of such a ""character"". Instead the shape-shifting alien is reduced to just a killer and is exploited for gory thrills and horror scares, but mostly it's just gross. The storytelling is sparse and visually uninteresting. The snow and ice is never really a factor and while it makes for beautiful scenery, but other than that the film looks really plain. The special effects are pretty damn impressive, but what's the use when they serve no other function. The acting is your typical stoic man on a mission fare, and no real emotions or character arcs are explored. Everything about this film is pedestrian and therefore it should be skipped.",NA
"amesmonde","24 February 2010","After being freed from its ancient crash site an extraterrestrial life form infiltrates an Antarctic research station, imitating taking the appearance of the researchers that it kills.An atmospheric understated sci-fi at it best. I'll never understand how Carpenter lost the lustre in some of the other film he made, nevertheless, his Thing is one of his best movies and also once of the best sci-fi movies ever. Despite being based on the same source material (before remakes were popular) the thing has a look and feel of it's own and is very different from its 50's counterpart.The isolated setting, the astounding cinematography and scenery creates intrigue; drawing you in from the very beginning. It's a perfect horror/sci-fi cocktail of Ennio Morricone's haunting foreboding score, Rob Bottin and Stan Winston's benchmark practical effects (which are to-date arguably unsurpassed) Carpenters claustrophobic set ups and Bill Lancaster screenplay. It's rare that every single actor is exceptional and supplied with effective dialogue. All the cast from Kurt Russell to Wilford Brimley as Blair are all captivating, great casting by Anita Dann. The characters have their own issues and as the paranoia sets in relationships are forged and other broken, building to a bold and satisfying conclusion.This is more than just a cult film with a 'monster' hiding in warm places surrounded by snow, it's a finely tuned science fiction horror masterpiece.",NA
"arungeorge13","5 June 2017","Forgive me for expressing my undying love for one of the best sci-fi horror flicks of all time. I (re)watched 'The Thing' for the umpteenth time today and my admiration towards the film and for all those behind it, has only augmented. Here are five reasons why the film will remain a cult-classic for the decades to come:1. The man himself. John Carpenter. Fresh off 'Halloween', 'The Fog' and 'Escape from New York' which were all commercial successes, Carpenter took over the reigns to direct his first studio picture – 'The Thing', which would be set in Antarctica and deal with a bunch of researchers who come in contact with an extra-terrestrial being. Unlike the one-massive-monstrous antagonist in Christian Nyby's 'The Thing from Another World', Carpenter wanted to present a more devout adaptation of the science fiction novella by John W Campbell Jr, and introduce a shape- shifting, human(or rather all living being)-assimilating alien. While this meant a lot of additional work, Carpenter seemed up for it. He shot the film in artificially frozen sets, and extensively applied practical FX to recreate the claustrophobic terror. However, the movie was a box-office failure, owing partly to the success of Spielberg's E.T and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.2. Practical FX by Rob Bottin(A then 22 year old) Bottin worked on the sets of 'The Thing' for a year, a project he worked his butt off for, so much that he had to be treated for stress-relief afterwards. Bottin worked with concept artist Mike Ploog to design the various gruesome creatures, their transformations and assimilation phases that would take centrestage in the film. The creatures looked absolutely scary yet the suspension of disbelief while witnessing the set-pieces was kept minimal. The spider-creatures, the two-body assimilation, the defibrillator chest chomp, the dog-things, everything looked on- point and downright grotesque. What is indeed sad to notice is the fact that while the 2011 prequel starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead had also employed practical FX by Amalgamated Dynamics (ADI), they were almost completely replaced digitally with the application of subpar CGI. The irony here is, critics and audiences alike wrote off the 2011 film citing horrible CGI in place of practical FX. Even the 1982 film's FX were shunned by the critics at the time of its release. Some even went on to call it a moronic, B-grade slaughterhouse film that used stuff like rubber, foam latex, gelatin, creamed corn, mayonnaise, strawberry jam and KY jelly for its effects. However, when the movie eventually achieved its cult status, the effects work was slowly getting the appreciation it had always deserved (some uncredited work from Stan Winston too!).3. The minimal soundtrack by Ennio MorriconeThe minimal beat-and-eerie-tune compositions (especially the Main theme) make my hair stand up every time they start playing. 'The Thing' is also one of the rare instances where Carpenter himself hasn't composed the music. It was indeed satisfying to see Morricone win the Golden Globe and the Academy Award 33 years later for 'The Hateful Eight' which held so much similarity to his compositions in 'The Thing'. I'd rate the OST for 'The Thing' as one of my personal faves when it comes to music in film. An ironical fact is that Morricone was nominated for a Worst Musical Score Razzie. I wonder what those guys were even thinking (or smoking!).4. Kurt Russell (& to an extent, Keith David)Kurt Russell as helicopter pilot R J MacReady left the audiences with a character that was certainly going to be remembered for ages. He was a bold, quick decision-maker who did just about anything to survive. It is impossible to fathom another actor who could have pulled off MacReady so well. Fun-fact is that Kurt almost blew himself up while throwing a stick of dynamite in a scene towards the end of the movie. That climactic scene where MacReady and Childs (Keith David's character) finally sit down to share a scotch while they decide to wait out, is truly unforgettable. It is also notable that the cast comprised purely of men.5. Legacy – The prequel, the video-game, the comics, the theme-park attractions, the yearly screeningsIt took nearly 29 years to spawn another film set in the same universe (which ended up as a prequel detailing the events at the Norwegian camp mentioned in Carpenter's film), that was partially able to recreate the ambiance and narrative style but lacked memorable characterization and the replacement of CGI over practical effects made it look sluggish.The video game (that served as a sequel) received positive reviews and it was deemed an excellent showcase in survival horror. The 'trust' system was met with praise. Personally, I loved every bit of it.. the storyline, the voice-overs, the in-game mechanics, the seemingly impossible-to-defeat boss levels.Alan Dean Foster, Dark Horse Comics and Clarkesworld Magazine published comics based on 'The Thing' at different points in time, all contributing as off-screen prologues, additional material or simply as heritage for the film.Haunted attractions based on the film were featured at some of the theme parks in the U.S.A.It is indeed inspiring to hear that 'The Thing' is annually viewed by members of the winter crew at the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station during the first evening of winter. It is also viewed by scientific personnel at the Summit Camp on the apex of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",NA
"dashtag1234","23 December 2020","John Carpenter is a genius. Halloween and The Thing are like my two favorite horror movies, and I prefer The Thing. This movie does what a lot of modern horror movies try to do, which is to have distinct characters and have us care for all of them. In The Thing, Carpenter (with the help of the screenwriter) has us get to know every single character, without it being redundant or boring. We know every character so when one doesn't make it, we know who it was. The practical effects are remarkable, and it is a creepy movie. It's creepier than most horror movies today. It is a highly underrated movie, and it did not get that much appraise during the time. Kurt Russel has a strong performance and Ennio Morricone's haunting score and theme really helps.",NA
"thinker1691","11 December 2010","John Carpenter took this timeless classic from the 1950's and updated it with his version of "" The Thing. "" The movie is based on the original John Campbell Jr. story and set not in the North Pole as in the original, but at the South Pole. In this version we have versatile actor Kurt Russell playing R.J.MacReady and Wilford Brimley as Dr. Blair. In this version, our Space visitor is seemly more dangerous as the 51 version in that The creature has the complete ability to Morph into any other creature. In other words, it's capable of 'Shape-Shifting' and becoming any creature it comes in contact with. Much more menacing than before, it soon has the entire cast wondering which of them will be next to be absorbed. Dark and horrifying, the movie is both dramatic and suspenseful and with the shadowy world of the space alien, it's only a matter of time before all the cast become prey. A good story and definitely more frightening than the original. Easily recommended. ****",NA
"Gotensive","30 March 2008","Don't let the extremely high rating here on IMDb fool you, this movie does not deliver. It honestly did nothing but bore me the entire time. The movie starts off slow, and never really gets going. There's no character development with any of the characters sans Kurt Russell, and the movie relies on Gore & special effects for it's scares. Trust me when I say there's absolutely nothing suspenseful about this movie, and the paranoia theme doesn't work here. What we basically get is some shape shifting Alien that apparently was frozen for thousands of years, which apparently a group of Norwegians was able to carry to their base, which then escaped and started attacking the group of Americans. That's the plot right there. What it does is it basically stays hidden as a dog for a very long time, apparently not in the mood to make it's attack, and only gets caught because apparently the sounds of dogs barking annoys it enough. And let's not forget how the seemingly immortal Shape Shifting Alien dies in such a laughably easy manner. Kurt Russell and his crew spend the entire time burning it down, and yet it somehow still finds a way to survive, making it seemingly immortal. Then at the end Russell blows it up easily with a stick of dynamite, which for some reason he never thought of doing before. We also have no idea what happens to the Nauls character, as he just disappears into oblivion. Apparently his character wasn't needed anymore, so the makers of this film decided to get rid of him by sending the character to go investigate something he saw, even though the character Nauls knows there's an Alien out there waiting to take over his body. Honestly, what sense does that make? That part right there was very poorly written. As to the ending, it really makes no sense because it features Russell's character and Childs sitting there wondering if each one is possibly The Thing, despite Russell just recently killing it. And if either one was The Thing, why didn't it attack the other? Why sit there drinking whiskey with a human when you could easily finish him off? It makes no sense to me. Also, neither apparently care to leave the freezing area, apparently leaving us to believe they both just die there. Anyway, the only points I give this movie for is the special effects, and the atmosphere. The location of Antarctica was fantastic, and the special effects for it's time were astounding. Other then that, this movie is poorly written and really boring. Pass on it, 3/10.",NA
"meliachild","16 October 2011","Truly one of the greatest examples of American horror cinema ever committed to celluloid. Legendary director John Carpenter uses every part of his immense talent to produce a true classic that just seems to get better with age. The camera glides from scene to scene & creates a magnificent atmosphere filled with paranoia & dread. The make up effects are a true delight created by Rob Bottin who produces some of the best effects you are ever likely see on film. On initial release The Thing was a box office failure mainly due to E.T being released at the same time which took over everything in its path. However the movie has picked up a massive cult following over the years & is rightly regarded as a true horror classic today. A brilliant piece of cinema from a true master director....They don't make movies like this anymore,sublime.",NA
"Volstag","3 February 2003","This is one of my absolute favorite horror movies.  Primarily because it actually creates believable tension, and some truly frightening moments. It's also one of those rare movies in which the characters behave, for the most part, like a real person would in a similar situation (er, rather, how you'd like to _think_ a real person would be have in such a situation).I know Carpenter catches a lot of flack, but this movie alone proves that he does have a certain degree of talent (when it comes to horror movies).I gave it an 8/10.",NA
"AMar_rom","4 December 2016","Carpenter's 'The Thing' is a remake of the 1951 film 'The Thing from Another World' produced by Howard Hawks, a classic horror film which did not lose its intensity and appeal, even after so many years.The story is about the men of an American arctic base (scientists and other personnel) who witness an invasion from a extraterrestrial being (The Thing). The scenario is based on the story 'Who Goes There?' by J.W. Campbell. The story line is similar in both movies with the men fighting for their lives inside a claustrophobic and remote environment.Nonetheless, a number of differences between the two movies are evident. Hawk's film is fast-paced and events unfold around a people versus 'monster' story. Carpenter's film, instead, is slower and takes its time to develop. Carpenter also creates a strong disbelief and suspicion that the person you see is not what he appears to be. The 'Thing' is a foe who attacks from the 'interior' and not from the 'exterior'. The men in the base are more vulnerable and their fight is more desperate. Special effects are simply amazing and show us the alien being in a grotesque and horrifying manner that the human mind cannot easily comprehend. And that's precisely the problem: it takes time for humans to understand the nature of the extraterrestrial threat. A 10/10 from me.",NA
