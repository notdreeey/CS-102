"ametaphysicalshark","27 June 2008","Who says popular films are not and cannot be art? If anything is proof that popular films can be of a stunningly high quality, the beauty of the animation, writing, music, and sound design in ""WALL·E"" is it. ""WALL·E"" eclipses even Andrew Stanton's ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" in the Pixar pantheon, is perhaps Pixar's best film to date and, call me crazy as I've just seen it, a contender for the title of best animated film, period.""WALL·E"" is everything we've come to expect from Pixar and more- colorful, vibrant, imaginative, exciting, involving, beautiful, and most importantly a film with interesting, involving characters. Sure, WALL·E is adorable, and as much credit as the animators get for that, this film would be nothing without Stanton's screenplay, which features very little dialogue but is still notably intelligent and surprisingly subtle, making a refreshing change from the 'go green' campaigns we're all so used to. Does ""WALL·E"" have a message? Sure, but it's an important message and it is delivered subtly and beautifully.""WALL·E"" operates on two levels (and works spectacularly well on both). It is a majestic science fiction epic like we haven't seen in a couple of decades and it is a genuinely touching and never cheap romance. ""WALL·E"" will never get points for originality but it doesn't exactly need them because the homages to great films and figures of the past- Chaplin, Keaton, Tati, the Marx Brothers, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (this one is particularly spectacular), ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" are actually homages and not ripoffs. ""WALL·E"" is a wonderful tribute to a bygone cinematic tradition (well, two or three of them actually). The social commentary in ""WALL·E"" is sobering because it's never overbearing and most importantly because we see the world through machines, machines who feel more about Earth and life than the humans do. The depiction of humans on the ship could have been incredibly offensive, cheap, and tasteless in concept but the execution here is absolutely perfect.What is most surprising about ""WALL·E"" is how sad it is. Not even in the 'how will they get out of this, oh I feel so sorry for them' way ""Finding Nemo"", a previous Stanton effort, is, but in a truly melancholy sense. The early portion of the film maintains all the playfulness of a Jacques Tati film but also evokes a striking and powerful feeling of loneliness. It's a brilliant introduction to WALL·E, given that the rest of the film is too wacky to bother with long scenes focused entirely on character, and works beautifully with the ugly yet beautifully-rendered future Earth, a barren wasteland filled with nothing but garbage, a seriously resilient cockroach being WALL·E's only companion before EVE shows up, but I won't go into the story- it's best you see it unfold for yourself.From the entertaining shorts shown before the film to the memorable characters, locations, and animation we have come to expect, Pixar films are now event cinema, and they have outdone themselves with ""WALL·E"". This film is spectacular, majestic, touching, involving, and achingly beautiful. Most importantly, however, it is perfect entertainment. I may be saying this too soon, but I don't think I have ever seen an animated film that has satisfied me more than ""WALL·E"", and 2008 is going to have to work hard to keep this from being the top film of the year, which it most certainly is at the moment.9.5/10","

The animation is stellar, its heartwarming, funny and proves that pixar movies are always bound to be great (except for cars 2 but thats a different story).

"Smells_Like_Cheese","27 June 2008","I'm starting to wonder if there is bad Disney/Pixar film, I mean, normally when we think of the combo, it does equal gold, we automatically know that everyone is going to love this movie, it's just a matter of comparison to the other animation films. I'm not just saying this because I had a good time when I was watching this, I'm very serious, this is my favorite Disney/Pixar film. It's completely worth the ticket price, this couldn't have been a more perfect film. Everything about WALL·E is just beyond great: the characters, the story, and the incredible animation. But the thing that I loved about WALL·E is it's message, I know that it does go a little over board with the ""jog or get fat"", ""throw your garbage away"", and the ""we've become too dependent on machines"" message, but I felt this was the most charming way to present it to the children who have to grow up in a world where they're going to have to worry about global warming, this may open their eyes a little.WALL·E is a robot that is left all alone on Planet Earth, Earth is now covered with garbage. The humans have left onto a corporate ship and are living their lives care free and well, thought free. WALL·E has been collecting little human pieces here and there and making them into his treasures, but the one thing he really wants is a friend. One day a ship lands with a female robot, Eve, who WALL·E just adores, but Eve is on a mission to find a plant to bring back onto the human ship to show that Earth is safe. But when the ship grabs Eve, WALL·E follows her and discovers the mutiny that is afoot on the ship. Everyone is overweight, can't walk, can't think for themselves, and let's all the robots do all the work for them. But WALL·E and Eve are on the mission to get them back to Earth and give it a little love.WALL·E is seriously the best movie I have seen this summer, I just adored this movie, it has great laughs, cute jokes and is entertaining for the whole family. Like I said before, when it's Disney/Pixar you just can't go wrong. WALL·E is one of their most lovable characters ever and was like the robot version of Charlie Chaplin, he brought great slap stick to the story. This movie delivers everything you can imagine and much more, not to mention a great message. I highly recommend this movie for everyone, it's just a very wonderful movie that anyone can enjoy. The animation, I can't believe how far we've come, but this was a beautifully made movie and couldn't have been better. I loved WALL·E, this is a movie that will bring you plenty of laughs for your summer.10/10","

"Chrysanthepop","2 November 2008","Over the years I've become quite a sucker for Pixar movies and just love each and every one of them. While there are the states of the art animation and sound effects, the stories have heart. The characters are adorable yet real. It reminds one of those charming movies Disney used to make but Pixar films are very much a unique cinematic experience. 'WALL-E' is quite unusual compared to the previous Pixar movies. There's hardly any dialogue between the two protagonists other than saying each other's name. In fact, barely a word is spoken in the entire first half hour but WALL-E and Eve's silent and playful love story is such a joy to watch. Even though of few words, both characters have strong personalities and the character development is wonderfully done. The animation is colourful and vivid. Sound effect is amazing. The robot characters are cute and charming. The score deserve special mention as it's mesmerizing and beautiful. Andrew Stanton has done a terrific job as director and co-writer. The portrayal of WALL-E's loneliness and need for love is very well done and then the change that is brought within after the entrance of Eve and his eventual determination to rescue her is effectively shown. There are many genuinely funny and creative moments and it manages to stay away from being 'just plain silly'. The story is rich with humour, action, drama and adventure. Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight do a fabulous job with the voice acting for WALL-E and Eve. John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy and Sigourney Weaver lend great support. While 'WALL-E' tells a magnificent love story it reminds us that Earth is our home and nothing can replace it. It's a joyous magical experience and another sure winner from Pixar.","

"TheLittleSongbird","1 December 2009","I heard mixed reviews on WALL-E, there were those who said it was magical, and those who said it was one of the most overrated movies ever. I will say I loved this movie, it is a truly beautiful movie. It could have done with being a tad longer perhaps, but essentially this is more than a movie with A List vocal talents, WALL-E has genuine heart and will definitely enchant children and any Pixar fan. All I will say is that I am sorry it took me such a long time to see it, I will admit I was differing whether I should see it or not. But I am glad I did. The animation is simply incredible, the whole film is wonderful to look at. The whole movie is done in a very sophisticated visual style, and the bright colours and sublime backgrounds were a delight to the eyes. The music is stunning, the orchestral themes are gorgeous but the song from Hello Dolly! was great and fitted in with the story well. Speaking of the story, it may seem thin to some, but it is a very simple heart warming one all the same with depth and poignancy. There are some very imaginative moments, such as the zero-gravity dance and the ride through space. The voice cast that includes Fred Willard, Sigourney Weaver and Pixar regular John Ratzenburger did an exceptional job, and all the characters were endearing. What made the movie was WALL-E himself, he has to be one of the most lovable and in-depth Pixar characters ever, and the writers create a very haunting atmosphere in the early scenes to match our little hero's isolation. All in all, brilliant, quite possibly one of the best films of 2008. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox","

"Sethtro","11 October 2020","Personal Rating: 10/10 (Outstanding)I still remember just how impactful this movie was on me when I saw it as a child. The visuals, storytelling, how it made you think. And 12 years later it still stands as one of the best movies Pixar has ever made, and truly a hallmark of animated films.The start of this movie. I could watch on an indefinite loop. The emotions you feel, the bond that grows between you and a robot in the introductory minutes, is storytelling at it's finest. No words have to be spoken and yet this movie world builds better than most 2-hour-long fantasy movies where the characters don't shut up.The visuals. The visuals in this movie are stunning, the way they direct the eye, immerse you in the world, make you laugh and make you cry, a huge credit to the artists who worked on this film. And also interestingly enough, to Roger Deakins, who contributed to the first 20 minutes of the film and to the animating team, as he consulted on how to light scenes, he's quoted saying ""the natural world that we live in just isn't as well-lit as your typical animated world."" So by darkening scenes, adding shadow and cutting the number of lights used, they added a huge layer of realism to WALL-E.The story, how you learn and feel about the characters (who the majority of are robots), the music, it's all superbly done. I can't think of anything I would change. But all this alone isn't what earns it the 10/10 rating, it's the themes, the tones, the way this ""for children"" movie makes you think, that earns my full respect.For the most part, humans choose what's convenient, sacrificing privacy, health, well being, relationships and the like for that. WALL-E showed that exact point like never before. It takes effort to overcome the norm, to work towards a goal, even when it's not rainbows and peaches when one is determined they can do amazing things. Which is why the ending of this movie isn't bleak, it's inspiring. (spoilers) Humans come back to earth because of one lonesome plant. But it's enough to give them hope, and determination, to work on transforming the planet. And that was just one of the themes explored beautifully. I already know I'll be watching this movie again, and again.Thanks for reading my review.""I didn't know we had a pool!""","

"seaview1","5 July 2008","Pixar has produced some of the best animation in the past decade with its computer-generated features (Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo) that have been marked by strong story lines and vivid characters. The tradition continues in an impressive way with Wall-E. This deceptively simple tale is transformed by the emotional content told almost entirely through visuals. A polluted Earth has become uninhabitable for 700 years, and one of its only residents is Wall-E, a small robot whose solitary mission is to be a mobile, trash compactor. In his work, he also finds and collects trivial, odd artifacts of mankind's past such as a Rubik's cube. He comforts himself with an old video, Hello Dolly, and as he learns about humans and his yearning for love, it becomes his idyllic vision of happiness amid an insulated, dull existence. Along his travels, he comes across a unique find, a live plant! One day a spaceship lands and deposits a robot probe. Fascinated by this kindred machine, Wall-E follows and eventually befriends this unit known as Eve. Eve has a directive that will hopefully return humans to Earth if only it can sustain life, and Wall-E's plant figures immeasurably. Eve is returned to her mother ship with Wall-E frantically chasing after his newly found love. On a spaceship acting as a living city for its machine-dependent, overweight humans, little robots are not only the caregivers, but in control. Wall-E and Eve must figure a way to return the humans to earth and find happiness even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice.Wall-E's innocence and childlike wonder (think E.T.), as exemplified by how he introduces himself to everyone he meets, could almost have sprung from Steven Spielberg's imagination. It's in the small details that enrich Wall-E as a character. He brings to mind an amalgam of past robots like Star Wars' R2-D2 and the little robots in Silent Running, and his fears and joys are expressed through body language and squeals. When he shuts down each night to sleep, he rocks himself as a child would. He is clumsy around Eve, and when he takes her to his makeshift home of robot parts and paraphernalia, he is like a little kid. Ironically, he is the catalyst to bring the humans back home. Writer and director, Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo), takes a huge risk by basing the film's premise almost entirely on a song from Hello Dolly. I can't think of an animated film that relied so much on visual storytelling. Even Fantasia and Allegro Non Troppo were collections of musical sequences not narrative features. In a way, this film is almost too sophisticated in its display and execution for little kids but is just right for adults. Remarkably, this is a tale with nary a spoken word by the principals. One has to think of silent films to approach this achievement. The operative word here is pathos like the best of Charlie Chaplin's little tramp and, amazingly, this film earns its stripes by emoting body language, action, and sound effects. Yet most of the characters aren't even human! Fred Willard has an amusing small role as the corporate president. Sigourney Weaver, as the ship's computer voice, is an inspired choice since, like Eve, she was a female hero (in the Alien movies) and had to deal with computer voices in those films. The animation is almost 3-D in its rich detail and simulated, fluid camera-work. The interior of the mother ship, the Axiom, is a futuristic view of a commercialized (think Blade Runner) city in space. Yes, it is a thinly veiled message for all those 'save the earth' and 'think green' people, but that never detracts from the main theme of saving humanity amid a touching love story. There are moments when you think a scene could have played out a bit better, but that is minor. It is likely that Wall-E's reputation will grow over time as a shining example of stretching the art form by challenging and trusting its audience. Bravo to the folks at Pixar for taking a chance and for entertaining and moving us.","

"claudio_carvalho","8 December 2008","In the Twentieth-Eighth Century, Earth is completely depleted and with the ecological system destroyed. The powerful corporation Buy N Large builds a huge spacecraft called Axiom and sends the entire civilization for a five-year cruise while trash collector robots called WALL-E (Waste Allocator Load Lifter  Earth) would clean the planet. However, the equipment fail and seven-hundred year later, only a single robot WALL-E is performing his duty. His only companion is a cockroach and his great entertainment is watching an old ""Hello Dolly"" videotape. When a spaceship lands on Earth out of the blue and leaves the probe Eve, WALL-E follows her and falls in love for Eve. After a hostile initial contact, the dangerous Eve gets close to WALL-E and he gives a small plant to her. Eve gets the plant and automatically sends a signal to the spaceship that returns and takes Eve back. However, the desperate WALL-E grabs on the hull and travels through the space chasing Eve until they reach Axiom and find a full automated facility crowded by lazy and fat human beings unable even of walking with their legs. The expectation of life on Earth brings hope to the Captain against the will and prime direction of the auto-pilot that organizes a mutiny on board.""WALL-E"" is one of the best animations I have ever seen, with adorable characters and a deep story, showing a possible scenario of the depletion of our planet caused by the lack of concern from the big corporations with the environment. In addition, there is the beautiful love story of WALL-E, the importance of small and forgotten things; a great nostalgia of the old times among many other message. The story is very well developed in spite of having very few dialogs. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""WALL-E""","

"DrWetter","8 June 2008","I just returned from an advanced benefit screening of WALL*E, and I want to be careful not to spill too much regarding the movie. I had the added privilege of watching the film at Pixar, which in and of itself, was amazing.This picture is not a cartoon; it is a film. In fact, it even has the LOOK of film. One of my complaints of more recent 3-D/CG animated films (not from Pixar) is that they all seem to look the same... clean lines, crisp colors, and very ""virtual"", for lack of a better term. WALL*E transcends the typical look of CG animation, and has a true to life ""grit."" The creators at Pixar are true artists, and are indeed masters of their craft. Not only are they masters of the technology, they are masters of telling a story. WALL*E is no exception.The best way to describe the film is as a science fiction, comedy, dramatic love story. WALL*E, as a character, has dimension, personality, and heart... pretty impressive given that he is essentially a trash compactor. It is true that there is little dialogue in this feature, but I personally did not feel it detracted from the story at all.WALL*E is very much a different Pixar film from it's previous features. I will be curious to see how it is received by others, but in my opinion, I think Pixar has stayed true to itself, demonstrating a commitment to telling great stories and pushing the edge of technology to leave your jaw dropping! My most sincere compliments to Andrew Stanton, Jim Morris, John Lasseter, Ben Burtt, and all the creative forces at Pixar. Can't wait to see what the future brings...","

"jedi-jones","29 June 2008","Wall-E is the movie experience I've been looking for. I haven't seen a new film this richly entertaining, thrilling, touching and satisfying since Spider-Man 2. It is truly the finest Pixar or animated CGI film to date. I can discuss it without spoilers easily because it's one of those films, like 2001: A Space Odyssey, that exists more as a pure experience of the heart and the senses than as a collection of events that we're supposed to keep track of intellectually. Wall-E rises above that kind of unnecessary complication into the same kind of space occupied by dreams and the imagination.This film is beautifully animated, of course, to that magical Pixar point where even piles of what should be disgusting trash somehow look breathtakingly gorgeous and even fairly realistic-looking roaches look cute. But much more importantly, the heart, the emotion in this movie is unlike anything I've experienced at the cinema since Forrest Gump. Certainly my tear ducts have not welled up while watching a movie this much since then. I fell in like with the character of Wall-E when I saw the trailer. Watching the movie, I fell in love with him within about 2 minutes. Shortly after that, I fell in love with the idea of Wall-E falling in love.My previous favorite movie romance is Superman and Lois Lane in the original Superman films. The love story, or the love experience of Wall-E and Eve is perhaps the first I've seen since then that operates at and succeeds on that same level. These couples create an uncomplicated, innocent, simple, yet deep and powerful bond. They capture the experience of love at first sight, writ large. They possess an instant chemistry that tells you they belong together from the first time they see one another and makes you root for their relationship throughout the film. Wall-E and Eve share moments together of real cinematic beauty, true hilarity, frightening sadness, frustrating difficulty and delightful satisfaction. It's a testament to the level of genius at which the Pixar storytellers are operating that we feel every beat of this relationship resonate every step of the way despite the fact that the characters are robots that are not modeled off of humans and speak no more than a handful of words throughout the movie (this animated movie is refreshingly free of obvious ""guest star"" voices or any over-the-top stand-up comedians trying to upstage the movie).Just like in the first Superman films, once you care about the characters as individuals and care about their relationship, it's almost impossible for the rest of the movie not to work. You're hooked at hello. Wall-E adds all the expected complications to keep the would-be lovers from getting together most of the time. There is a truly great ""McGuffin"" that keeps the heroes and villains busy for quite a while (the item in question is something outwardly simple that ends up holding the key to something more important than anything in the world). The pacing during most of these adventures is as breakneck as anything out of the Star Wars films and the action is always staged with crystal clarity. There are several scenes of peril for Wall-E that are reminiscent of that oddly powerful sequence in Short Circuit 2 when Johnny 5 is almost killed. The filmmakers pull absolutely no punches when it comes to running your heart through the ringer over characters you care about. It probably helps that you can do a lot more physical damage to a robot character than you can to a human character while keeping a G rating and still getting the audience dramatically worried about their survival.Even on top of the action, the emotion, the visuals and the humor, Wall-E goes the extra mile into thought-provoking thematic territory. The film never hits you over the head with anything preachy and doesn't really even outright tell you what its opinions on the subjects it raises are. It also doesn't explicitly lay out explanations for everything that exists in Wall-E's world (there are no ""talking killer"" scenes and very little verbal exposition). I think the bits of ambiguity work here because they add to the sense of mystery, helplessness and alienation that most of the characters in the movie feel to some degree.There are human characters in this movie too, quite a few. I think that's necessary because if humans aren't shown in a robot world, you have to wonder what purpose were the robots designed to serve? That was a curiosity of the earlier CGI movie, Robots. Most of the humans in Wall-E aren't as developed as the robots, but I think that's because they exist more to represent the whole of humanity rather than particular individuals. We're asked to ponder the consequences of the choices they make as though the whole society was moving in that direction, not just one person. Wall-E and Eve are the heart of this movie but the humans are used to add some intellectual gravity for the audience to chew on.Other choices made in the movie might also leave room for debate, such as the integration of some live-action footage into the film. But because the movie as a whole is so audaciously stimulating and brilliantly satisfying, it's a plus that they left us with a few unresolved or unusual things to think about and question after getting off of the great emotional and visual roller-coaster experience. Wall-E truly serves up everything that I think an audience could want in a movie experience. It will be very easy for me to watch this one over and over again. It is a modern-day classic that I believe should earn a place in cinema history as the ""2001"" of CGI animated films, both of them movies of indisputable brilliance, unyielding imagination and unending entertainment.Footnote: The pre-movie short is an awesome, violent Looney Tunes/Roger Rabbit-esquire toon. It wants only to entertain and does.","

"jaredmobarak","25 June 2008","Robots falling in love. There is a lot to like about the new Pixar film Wall-E. The animation goes without sayingbetter than anything out there. The glares, the environments, everything is rendered spectacularly, right down to the flame of a Zippo lighter. As for the story, leave it to these wizards for creating a tale that hits on a gut level, letting our simplest emotions come to the surface in order speak to our hearts and souls. With fewer words than Arnold Swartzenegger had to speak in Terminator 2, this movie relies on its visuals and on the movements and actions of the characters. It is appropriate that we are shown clips from older musicals to show humanity before Earth was abandoned. If we harken back to them for the joys of people, why not go to silent era style in order to portray communication between beings that cannot speak? Wall-E, his crush EVE, and all the other robots involved can say little than their name, however, we understand exactly what they mean throughout. The entire film speaks on a level that most people might have forgotten. In an age of Hollywood spoon-feeding the masses by having actors preach the obvious, Pixar has shown their originality again by getting an audience to partake in a film that makes them pay attention and work a little; something that the message of the piece is trying to have come across for humanity in general.I credit the filmmakers for showcasing a world that has been left unlivable due to pollution and excess, yet never stooping to the level of liberal propaganda to soapbox an environmental agenda. No, the idea of ""going green"" or ""stop global warming"" never comes out blatantly, but instead we are shown the message of how technology is making us gluttons and sloths, reliant for everything and unable to even see what is going on right in front of our faces. Humanity, drifting on a space station for 700 years being waited on hand and foot, has become a giant mass of inactive waste. Watching their awakening at the hands of a little waste removal machine, seeing love, life, and beauty as if for the first time ever is a wonderful thing. Sure the homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey is fantastic, but these moments work on another level altogetherthat of truth. Consumer culture and materialism has destroyed our society to the point that social status depends on the car you drive and the trinkets you can collect rather than the job you do and the work you put in. To see the Captain of the vessel, housing what has become of the human race, slowly open his eyes to what could be is mind-blowingly simple, yet also so necessary for children these days to see what burying their heads in the computer and cell phone is doing to the societal structure of the world. We need to stop being lemmings, droning along without purpose. There is a reason for life, things to strive for and love is one of them, something very prevalent here.The robots themselves become more human than the humans, showing the emotion and compassion that people have left by the wayside. Curiosity takes center stage as Wall-E finds treasures amongst the trash he has been programmed to clean up for a return of life to Earth. Stacking his compacted boxes of refuse into skyscrapers taller than those left behind, he finds shelter in an abandoned tractor where he keeps spare parts and objects to play with during his solitude. Never expecting a visitor, or the impact that finding a small sapling of greenery could cause, a sophisticated robot named EVE arrives and changes his world forever. Not only does she become the woman of his dreams, but she also causes him to leave Earth and discover the spaceship, which has been trying to find his home for way too long.Maybe it is funny to say, but the chemistry between these two machines is quite palpable and real, as they discover feelings that they shouldn't have due to programming and such, but they have evolved into sentient creatures. They fight for freedom against the spaceship's auto-pilot and take a stand to end the tyranny that has been subtly and effectively beating the humans into submission. Of course they may not be doing it for the humans per se, there is a matter of needing to go back for spare parts, but you'll understand once you see. Sure the Captain does his part to see the hero that Wall-E becomes to his stagnant race and being voiced by the hilarious Jeff Garlin definitely helps. When he starts viewing the history of Earth and just exudes wonderment and joy, you really enjoy the ride as he attempts to reverse his sloth and actually stand on his two legs for possibly the first time ever.Where I do have a problem with the film is the pacing. Yes, I know there is very little dialogueand I whole-heartedly praise the film for itbut the beginning does have a tendency to drag. Maybe some of that has to do with it being an extended version of the trailer, but it just gets a little tedious as we wait for EVE to arrive and end the cute monotony of Wall-E playing with his finds in ways they aren't supposed to be used for, we've seen it before in The Little Mermaid. Even once they are on the ship, the cat and mouse game gets a little prolonged to pad the runtime a bit. The story here isn't very complex and I just wish there had been more to it, or at least a bit faster paced of a plot progression. Otherwise, though, this is another solid film from Pixar, showing that they definitely have the creativity and storytelling ability to infuse heart back into cinema and try new things rather than regurgitate for a big paycheck.","

"CA_movie_fan","7 June 2008","We went to the San Francisco Film Institute's first public screening at their campus in Emeryville. Everyone's sworn to secrecy, but for a film with little dialog, it carries more of an emotional punch and has a richer story than any live-action movie this year. The tone and style of the film is completely different for Pixar, and Disney haven't tried to override the darker thematic elements at all, making the story surprisingly three-dimensional.This will end up being the animated film of the year and I had the same 'wow' feeling as after seeing Ratatouille. Considering that animated films have always played second-fiddle to live-action, and have been aimed at kids, it's ironic that once again Pixar produces a film that rivals any live action on every level.

"Valeen_the_II","27 June 2008","This truly is one beautiful, touching animated sci-fi film....I cannot stress this enough. It's a unique cinema experience that you must enjoy firsthand.The tale is set in the 22th century , Earth has become a lifeless wasteland full of garbage, that the human race evacuated nearly a millennium ago....Lifeless, that is with the two exceptions being the ""artifical"" life form ""WALL-E"" & his pet cockroach.WALL-E is a squat humble trash-compacting robot who while continuing to fulfill the duties he was programmed for ( even though it's pointless considering there are no more humans on the planet ) collects certain leftover nicknacks, novelty items and even old films that he can still play. He mentally stimulates himself and enjoys fragments of the culture that is now gone ( that of the human race ). Though, WALL-E has imprinted on his little cockroach & vice versa, the little robot longs for more companionship.He receives it in the form of a beautiful, sleek, defensive ""fembot fatale"" ""EVE ""....In their own little forms of robotic communication ( repeating each other's names in various connotations depending on moods ; ""WAAAALLL-E,"" ""EEEEEEEE-VAH!"" ) and WALL-E's Chaplin-esquire clumsiness that amuses EVE, the pair imprint on each other and enjoy each other's company.Sadly, EVE has located a small plant and must return it to her mother ship and leave WALL-E forever...But WALLL-E hops aboard the ship in pursuit of his darling ""EEEEEE-VAH"".And yes this film has very little dialog, but guess what, IT DON'T NEED NO STINKIN' DIALIOUGUE!....The brilliance and beauty of the film is in the interactions and responses of the little robots : a great representation of what ""artificial intelligence"" really is and what it may actually be one day! And how ironic it is that in this film the organic HUMAN RACE has become soulless, mirthless, artless, jaded, self-centered cogs in a machine of blind consumerism, yet the mechanical artificial beings still respond to their surroundings like a toddler or pet : with curiosity, wonder, and delight in communication & learning.And yes there is plenty of comic relief ( albeit sans dialouge ) so no this movie is NOT BORING....It's beautiful, it even made me a little bit misty-eyed.So yeah if you're an a fan of animated films, sci-fi films, and romance you should definitely check out this movie.Obviously, it is going to win a very well-deserved Oscar for ""Best Animated Film"".","

"michael11391","26 June 2008","Not only it's Pixar's best film of all-time but it's the best movie of this year and one of the greatest imaginative, visually, moving & excellent animated films in years and surprisingly, one of the best sci-fi movies since E.T.!! Coming with high expectations, it definitely succeeded mines. It's so beautiful, moving, hilarious & sad at the same time. And for those who has been anticipating Thomas Newman's score for WALL-E, it's certainly one of his best right behind Finding Nemo in which I thought was his best score to date! Like I said it's Pixar best film so far, WALL-E knocked off Ratatouille of the top spot in which I thought it was their best film to date and officially, WALL-E is the best Pixar film i've ever seen with Ratatouille right behind and Finding Nemo, third. Pixar fan or non-Pixar fan, you'll definitely enjoy this one. WALL-E will forever be remembered as one of the most lovable characters ever created on film!!!","

"DICK STEEL","29 August 2008","In some strange twist of Fate, the local release of recent Pixar movies always had us here twiddling our thumbs wondering when it'll finally make its way to the screens, while we hear the accolades ring from the rest of the world in marvelling at the quality that Pixar continually churns out. It's likely that the distributors want to coincide the release with the local school holidays, but frankly, the money also comes from the adult crowd, as testament to this full house in one of the largest screens downtown during a late night screening with nary a noisy kid in tow.And I may sound like a broken record, but Pixar has done it again. Quality stories with quality animation, and it kept the run time to a manageable under 100 minutes, compared to the previous offering Ratatouille, which clocked near 120 minutes (or actually felt that long). I never expected WALL·E to pack in such a strong emotional punch, not that Pixar has never animated non-living objects before (such as Cars), but there's a certain child like innocence appeal that WALL·E possesses, that makes him very charming, and very endearing to the audience.As a Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth-Class, Isaac Asimov's Robot directives has him firmly and dutifully carrying out his duties of compacting Earth's rubbish, as the last of its class on Earth to clean up the mess. Humans have now polluted the world so much that they took to Space in Star Trek inspired ship designs, to live out there while WALL·Es take over to do some massive spring cleaning. Until of course, our WALL·E becomes like The Last Man, erm, Robot on Earth with a cockroach companion, acting and emoting superbly that puts Will Smith to shame.The fantastic thing about WALL·E is that it can tell so much by so little. The first few minutes establish everything we need to know about the current world, and paints a very humanistic, soulful value to the dusty, dirty and rickety robot. He (see what I mean?) has a lot of eccentricities, and in performing his duties, develops quirks and becomes a collector (of junk) of sorts, which allows the creators to pump in plenty of sight gags and inside jokes ranging from sound effects (I swear my Apple is now a WALL·E pre-cursor) to paying homage to movies such as 2001: A Space Odessey.In essence, WALL·E is a love story in human terms, where the boy tries hard to get the girl, only to have her spurn his advances. EVE (which stands for Extraterrestial Vegetation Evaluator) is WALL·E's object of affection, who got sent to Earth as a probe for life. And my, she's a difficult one to handle, being state of the art, as well as packing a mean self-defense mechanism that makes breaking the ice really difficult. Not to mention as well, a fiery temper to boot. Which means our guy has to really try, and try hard, to break that wall down. Poor thing really, because all he wanted to do, was to hold her hand. The Beatles would have been proud.But of course you'll have to throw in tougher adversary and events to make it all the more worthwhile in WALL·E's pursuit of EVE, which spans lightyears and a plant that becomes the catalyst for their romance. A lot of the movie takes place on board The Axiom, the human ship where a vision of the future is presented, which metaphorically holds a mirror up to ourselves in our over reliance in technology that we're beginning to grow sideways, and not noticing the things that nature has in store for us, human to human communication, and the things that matter. It also has an soft environmental message and stance thrown in, but done so subtly that you wouldn't feel that it's being preachy and a turn off.I hate to admit it too that the movie turned me into a big softie, especially its clichéd finale, where you know what will happen, but yet want to second guess if the filmmakers could be so heartless with an ending that I thought would really make me shed a tear. However, it's Disney after all, and when you think of merchandise opportunities, then business sense prevails.WALL·E deserves every acclaim that it's got, and let me contribute mine too. If you have time to only watch one animated movie this year, or want to bring your kids to one, then make no mistake, WALL·E is the perfect choice, without a doubt, hands down. It makes it to my books as contender for the top 10 movies of the year. Highly recommended stuff, and the leads don't even speak much save to call out to each other!Oh, do put your bum on the seat early too, as with all Pixar features, there's always a short that preluded it, and Presto is nothing short of hilarious, and a crowd pleaser to rouse the audience into a frenzy before the main act takes over. I guess it's high time I purchase the collection of Pixar shorts available on DVD as well.","

"MihaiSorinToma","5 October 2018","After Earth gets overwhelmed by garbage, all humans flee into space aboard the Axiom, waiting for robots to clean up the mess. Among them, Wall-E has developed a small personality, gathering objects of its interest, while doing the job it was programmed for. Meanwhile, a probe from the Axiom arrives, by the name of Eve, and starts looking for evidence of life. Together, they're about to change the fate of humanity, without even knowing the consequences of their actions.It's a movie which tries to send a message about pollution and ultimately, its effects in the upcoming future, and it does it with style. By telling the story of the two cute robots, which is without any doubt very emotional and catchy, it draws the viewer into its world, making him care about the main characters and willing or unwillingly, about the fate of future humans who inevitably decayed into human-like vegetables. It's beautifully animated, written and presented, making it an animation with class which will stay on top for many years to come.","

"likeminded","23 June 2008","Just got back from a special sneak peek/advance screening of this movie, and I must say, Pixar continues to amaze. They just can't seem to make a bad move. Heck, they can't even make a mediocre movie. Now, I will admit, there have been a couple that I would classify as my ""least favorite"" of theirs, but even they were actually very, very good. This one, though...it just may take the cake. Ranks up there with the absolute best they have produced. Hysterical, emotional, meaningful -- this movie succeeds on every front! I am not going to get into spoilers or specific plot aspects, but I will say that I am almost definitely going to see this one again in the theater..and it will be worth every dime. Come Friday, be in line to see Wall-E. You don't want to miss it!","

"Hitchcoc","14 August 2009","I was skeptical when I heard that this was a movie about machines falling in love. This kind of thing has been done before and has left me cold. This movie, however, takes a character who has endured in his lot, a romantic robot at that, and gives him a chance to realize his dreams. He has learned about love from watching a dull old Disney-like musical. One of those forgettable things that children hated, but were frequently brought to by their parents. He has established himself a sentient being with a loving soul. One day a slick rocket ship drops a probe into his garbage infested landscape. It is a porcelain-like, egg shaped beauty with deadly capabilities needed for self-preservation. This critter is egg shaped, unlike Wall-e's dumpy presence. He falls in love with her (she is definitely quite feminine. Like all desperate males, he does what he can to impress her, almost at the expense of his existence. The other interesting aspect of this film is the human element. Humanity has devolved into fat, slovenly lumps, with no thoughts or ambitions. When Wall-e shows up in their spaceship, he throws a wrench into the works. This little commentary is inadequate. Mainly, I found the whole thing quite charming and the evolving love affair believable.","

"kosmasp","30 January 2009","Apart from Cars (which as I heard will get a sequel, surprisingly for me at least), every movie Pixar made until this point in time, was at least excellent, imho. And even Cars, was still pretty good, just never hit as high, as the other ones did. WALL-E is proof yet again, that there is only one true animation champ! Yes there are other good, funny animated movies, from other studios, but only Pixar has a strong enough story to mix with all the little jokes. Only they can appeal to a young audience and a mature one. Wall-E seems like a strange idea. Something that might not get you emotional involved (the main characters are derived of many facial expressions, due to the fact, that they are robots and are lacking some facial similarity to a human being. Yes there are the eyes, but many other things are absent. Not that you would want to have it any other way. The movie is pretty silent (especially in the first part of the movie), but you still get attached to this robot being.There are many in-jokes for the mature audience, a message delivered with the right notes and many other funny things, that makes WALL-E one of the best movies. Not only in 2008, but overall.","

"Chiyonosake23","1 February 2010","Well I don't even know where to begin there is so much in this one. Well maybe if i say i am usually cinical and disdainful towards love stories (at least those type of love stories you see nowadays...), and i usually see them only suitable for girls who wanna cry a few tissue full, and i prefer a Shakespeare-like ending, where every major character dies or loses something (sanity, beloved one etc) over an usual corny happy ending, and then i add, that i still LOVED this masterpiece so much i myself cried in the end, and i was cheering for Wall-E to remember to Eve, to get repaired and to see them ""live happily ever after"". I was browsing on a video-sharing channel some day and i stumbled upon a video where a guy says the following about Wall-E: ""I am a cinical bastard, but even that little piece of rotten, black glass i call my heart was warmed by this movie"" And i don't even get started on how delicate and clever the symbolism in this animation is. Or on how sarcastic, yet true all the scenes are, which ones are featuring the humans, who became more like a senseless pigs tied to their chair in front of their computer. The whole thing feels so gentle, so classy and uplifting i cant even tell. If humanity will extincts one day and some other intelligent species will find the ruins of our culture i want them to find this movie, and remember us as gentle, warm-hearted, intelligent beings, which we weren't most of the time. And i am not exaggerating. This was really truly this good. At least for me. Sayonara","

"fernandoschiavi","30 May 2021","The film starts in the year 2700, having as main scenario our planet, basically uninhabited. It presents itself as a large garbage dump, in which the main character of the film, Wall-e (Waste Allocation Load Lifters - Earth), works to compact and organize all this rubble, alone, since his professional companions are already spoiled. So he and his pet cockroach are the only inhabitants of that gray planet.Wall-e, like other robots, were sent to Earth by the company BNL to perform this service. Meanwhile, human beings protect themselves from all the toxicity of our planet on the Axiom space station. The plan was that they would only stay there for five years, waiting for the completion of such work to return to our planet; but they end up staying for about 700 years. To check if the Earth is already habitable, the company sends robots there, one of which is Eva (Alien Vegetation Examiner), who will fall in love with the main character (and vice versa).It takes almost 40 minutes to appear the first human called normal, in 3D animation, and what you see is that the biped race is accommodated, all obese, sitting, being served by machines, hostages of technology and the inherent vices to be always connected. Behavioral criticism is evident, and all paranoia of humans with possibilities of contamination due to the planet or even Wall E is the simple and best example of how stuck the routine of doing nothing they are. There are two demarcations that demonstrate the criticism of Stanton's script, Jim Reardon based on the argument of the director himself and Pete Docter, who is the beginning of the film, showing the planet taken from plastic, paper and dirt in general, and also the super screens that entertains and distracts obese men, who do nothing but eat and spend their time shopping or watching some silly and futile show.WALL · E has one of the most critical messages to society made in a Pixar film, perhaps on par with Up - Altas Aventuras. With a script of minimal dialogues and quite dense concepts such as ideology, axiom (which is the name of the ship), mass culture and alienation, especially in favor of the media + machines, the film puts humanity at a limit that does not seem to us like so impossible, distant, unreal. If we take away the great scope of futuristic technology that marks the feature, including in its visual and conceptual references to films of the genre such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Plant of the Apes (1968), it is possible to see its raw material in our time, from the rampant and irresponsible production of garbage, as well as pollution, fires and other environmental disasters caused by human action; from the criticism of the criticism of the media to a complete alienation through a screen or an information bulletin; unhealthy inactivity; growing consumption; the distance between generations; the greater difficulty in making and maintaining human ties.The film discreetly criticizes the methods of advertising and the impact it has on people, who begin to buy products without the slightest need. Another reflection that the film exhibits is the issue of individualism. Individualism can be considered a way to avoid the problems experienced in this period, but it causes the distance between people and generations. Today, we can see some similarities, can't we? The space between people is getting bigger and bigger. In the past, the forms of interaction were more intense. The distance is the result of the accelerated growth of cities, of mass communication vehicles that dictate rules of consumption and the use of new technologies in an unbridled way. Wall-E shows us that it is necessary to relearn how to use technology and to know how to manage time efficiently and intelligently, without leaving it dependent on us and slaves, providing more and more new spoiled generations who are more and more accustomed to having ""everything in the hand with a simple snap of the fingers, guided by immediacy and by giving more value to digital relationships than face-to-face ones.Pixar's already famous self-references and full approximation with creations from our world, such as Isaac Asimov's laws of robotics that all robots in the film obey; Stephen Hawking's voice as a building parameter for AUTO; basic models of Spanish architecture Santiago Calatrava; NASA projects and numerous references to Apple (Steve Jobs was involved in the beginning of the project and is credited with the thanks for the feature) make WALL·E a whole ocean of creativity, one of those movies that you watch with great pleasure and end the session definitely more passionate about life and cinema. There are few scientific fictions that have such a tender history and such a great civilizing greatness - starting from a text with a small number of words -, starting at a point without hope and beginning to rebuild a world; the resumption of humanity, spoiled by itself, generations before. The question that doesn't stop is: are we following the same path?And all of this becomes even more impressive when we realize that Wall-E is almost a silent film. Its first part, with harmonious and romantic photography, is marked only by the noises and sounds of a polluted and uninhabited environment. The second part, already in the Axiom nave with its strong contrast photography (in various color palettes) but predominantly sterile, has some computer voices and few human voices, but never to the point of becoming strongly relevant in the story, which is sustained by friendliness of the two protagonist robots.Director Andrew Stanton has always said in interviews that the central theme of WALL · E is love and his ability to win everything, including programming. Try to see that statement as widely as possible. From love to a romantic couple to the love of life. From robotics programming to ideological programming, both broken by the encounter of something so powerful that it can only be fully explained, in the film, by scenes from the musical Hello, Dolly! (1969), a moment of joy, love, music and dance amid loneliness and abandonment. The humanized details of WALL · E's ""home"", his pet cockroach, the little plant inside his boot and the collection of human objects such as cutlery, magic cube, K7 tape (reproducing Put On Your Sunday Clothes, It Only Takes a Moment and La Vie en Rose) among many others, amplify the contrast between the two moments of the film, from its sentimental load to its lesson in citizenship and humanitarianism. Showing some scenes with real actors - a novelty among Pixar's productions - and maintaining the very high graphic quality of its animations, the ship's division with different configuration, details, lighting and colors (simulating small spaces in Las Vegas, Shanghai, Dubai and conceptual arts made for Tomorrowland) until taken from space and Earth, the film brings us so much to pay attention, observe and absorb that only one session is not possible to check it as it should.There are several scenes that impress, especially those located in space. One in particular deserves to be highlighted: the ballet of Wall-E and Eva, when they have fun flying outside the ship. It is a magical scene, due to the precise combination of visual and emotional beauty. At this point the film has already changed its history a lot, bringing to light what happened to the humans who left the Earth. And here comes another great idea from Pixar, with a critical analysis of modern society. Again, surprising. If Wall-E could be defined with just one word, perhaps the ideal would be grace. And if the ending sounds a bit obvious and predictable, we're already sufficiently captivated by this character and his universe to come to the happy conclusion that sometimes the obvious well done is exactly what we want. And if that's not enough, then there's that beautiful sequence of end credits, a real art history class, starting with cave paintings and moving on to Atari-style digital graphics. Geniuses.Can you imagine a story capable of provoking the most varied range of reactions possible in the viewer? Well then, so is Wall-E. At the beginning the scenario causes melancholy, then arouses curiosity, then comes interest, grace, laughter, sadness, tension, magic, suspense, fear, danger, regret, surprise, humor. , passion, tears, satisfaction, guilt, remorse, enthusiasm, excitement, love. Everything is there, mixed and arranged according to the precision of the gaze of those who observe here, knowing that that second chance may be something that we ourselves are not entitled to if we continue to ignore the universe around us.Wall-E is flawless in every way. There is a strong and relevant message to be transmitted, combined with a visual of great impact and with absurdly captivating characters - Wall-E and Eva are, from now on, the best couple in modern cinema! No matter what you read, this is a story that will always provoke new reflection. First-rate entertainment, respect for our intelligence and a product that can go beyond the obvious, by dealing with simple topics with wisdom and competence. There are films that bring about changes in society, raise questions and cause controversy. This, on the other hand, takes a step forward.","

"isabelle1955","29 June 2008","I very rarely give ten out of ten to a movie, but I have no hesitation in giving that perfect score to WALL-E. It is sublime. Not just the best animation I've seen in a long time, but simply one of the best movies I've seen in many months in terms of coherent and effective story-telling and seamless editing. It's extremely well put together. The animation is in a class of its own. My only slightly negative comment might be that clearly this isn't a movie aimed at little kids, and perhaps the marketing strategy is showing too much of the 'cute funnies' and not enough of the sheer artistry of Pixar's vision. This is not a bright, sunny view of the world where everyone lives happily ever after, but quite clearly a message movie; if you agree with the message, you will love this film.Disney may own Pixar these days, but there is an artistic divide between the two production styles. If you want predictable sentimentality watch Disney. I loved Disney's older classics but some of their later offerings  with the exception of Beauty and the Beast which was very good - made me wince when I took my kids along. But in contrast I have loved every single film that Pixar have made since Toy Story in 1995, and if you want something more wry, but still possessing humour and heart, then Pixar is probably going to be your choice.The story is simple enough. It's the year 2700 and the earth has become uninhabitable, not through some terrible cataclysmic event, but by a slow accumulation of suffocating junk. It's a wasteland devoid of living things. As the opening shots pan in, we see that the skyscrapers are actually tall mounds of compressed trash, and that the compressing is being done by WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth class), a small, solitary robot which keeps itself going by scavenging parts from all his clapped out siblings. WALL-E's only companion is a cockroach, and he fills in the time in his trailer home during long dust storms by watching an old video of Hello Dolly. WALL-E is an unlikely hero, rusty but trusty. I hesitate to use the word cute, endearing works better. One day he finds a single plant growing. He doesn't appreciate its significance but takes it home anyway where he squirrels it away with his other treasures such as a Rubic's Cube, a lighter and a trash can lid.Then a space ship lands and EVE emerges (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). Eve is in a whole different class to WALL-E. She can fly, he is earth bound, she is sleek, dangerous and single minded while he is bumbling and rather dowdy. They communicate with beeps and eye twitches, and WALL-E is hooked. When WALL-E gives EVE the plant he has found, she recognizes that her directive  to find evidence of photosynthesis on earth  is fulfilled and shuts down. The ship comes back to pick her up and WALL-E clings on, desperate not to lose her. Arriving at the mother ship, we find the last remaining humans (apparently all American!) who have fled the earth at the behest of the CEO of Buy N Large, a conglomerate who ended up running everything. The humans are pretty much big, obese babies, who have lost the use of their legs and are spoon fed artificial food and platitudinous slogans in equal measure. The rest of the movie involves a plot by the auto pilot to take over the ship and keep it on course away from earth, while the captain tries to take it home, aided by WALL-E and an entertaining array of quirky malfunctioning robots let loose from the repair bay.Some of the best moments are to be found in WALL-E's interaction with everyday objects; a fire extinguisher for example, enables him to zip around in space in a balletic dance with EVE, he uses a lid as a hat to imitate the dancers he sees on his video screen. The humans are not presented as wicked or evil, just unthinking, and the movie ends on a positive and upbeat note, when they recover the use of their legs and return to earth to reclaim it as their home. There are nods to many classic sci-fi movies, Pixar's ubiquitous pizza truck is there near the beginning, and they are not beyond a little self criticism; there's a discarded iPod among WALL-E's accumulated junk.I found myself caring far more about the animated characters in WALL-E than the supposedly human ones in many 'regular' movies. Director Andrew Stanton and everyone at Pixar deserve huge credit for this movie and I hope it is an enormous financial hit for them. I also hope it gets an Oscar nomination, not for best animated feature, but for best film.","

Meanwhile they have left garbage collecting robots like WALL·E to clean up the earth. It spends it's days packing garbage into cubes. Then one day, an advanced robot EVE is dropped off to do reconnaissance. EVE collects samples and blasts everything that moves. When WALL-E shows EVE a plant, her mission is complete and she is retrieved by a spaceship. WALL-E follows EVE and grabs a ride back to cruise ship. It finds the human race are now chubby blobs who are always eating and sitting on their floating chairs.This is a cute movie. There is no dialog with the robots. The use of robotic beeps and tones create their voices. It's as much fun as any of the best silent movies staring Chaplin or Keaton. Most of the movie takes place without human dialog. It is imaginative and original. It is another one of the amazing offerings from PIXAR.","

"ccthemovieman-1","7 December 2008","Boy, the visuals were as stunning as I had read they were; absolutely spectacular. I hate to use this cliché, but this is a ""must"" for Blu-Ray fans. You have to see - and hear - this film in HD because it is a great treat for your senses. The surround sounds are everywhere while the colors and artwork are something to behold! And, yes - it's still very pretty on a regular DVD, too.The story is ""cute,"" but nowhere near the visuals and audio. It's okay, subtlety humorous, dramatic and romantic parts. It gets a tiny bit preachy with the usual environmental digs and a comment about how fat we humans can get by lying around too much, but otherwise just plays it for comedy and cool-looking characters. Everyone and everything in this film is pretty amazing-looking.It's kind of a strange story, with much of it taking place on a big space ship. My favorite parts were in the beginning on Earth with the little robot WALL-E and his cockroach friend.There is so much to see in this film, it makes multiple viewings all the more attractive but, I'll assume, you're always going to catch some things you didn't see the first few times. Overall, not a super story but yet an amazing film, one that is one you want to show off your Blu-Ray DVD player to friends. This sets yet another new standard in animation.","

"tedg","2 July 2008","You can read elsewhere the ordinary stuff  about how wonderful this is; about how it exploits cinematic characterization, and even how conservative bloggers have decided to criticize it supposedly leftist premise. (Jees)I did enjoy it. Its an amazing experience. But while watching it, I also was admiring the minds behind it. There are sometimes intelligent movies being made, and a surprising number of them are from Hollywood. I believe though that in most cases, it is because there is a critical mass of intelligent writers, filmmakers and decisionmakers that are working at the fringe of the establishment. Not so with Pixar. I've been constantly surprised at each project how they encapsulate essays in the advance of the cinematic vocabulary.Its a bit like French new wave films made by film theorists, the films being more about what can be done than doing it in the service of effect that matters. (Their retort would be that it DOES matter if it changes the vehicle.)But this Pixar business is a different model. Folks can come and be entertained without having to dip into vats of self-reference. Oh, there's plenty of superficial self-reference, but its all in the service of jokes, and they are all in the service of the narrative.But other folks  like me and perhaps you  can also see that they are doing a few things that no one else is in quite the same advanced way, and they mark them so that you can read it as a sort of metanarrative. Jobs does the same thing with Apple. They make products that people use and like. But they also are in the business of defining what it is to be cool. They manufacture cool like they manufacture electronic products. You get both, and even in the products there's a reference to leadership, because being cool is all in who defines cool.So when I saw this, I saw self-conscious art, and stories about the future of cinema. We've always gotten that with Pixar. Usually, it has to do with space, and what you can do with this new medium that is impossible with ""real"" cameras and places.This last movie, ""Ratatouie"" added in the notion of control. Pulling the strings. I'm sure many have noticed that the shorts that Pixar creates to play before these features are a sort of synopsis of the reflective ideas they will use in the film. Last time the short and film were about control at a distance, with both the puppetmaster and puppet being featured, but the star was the puppetmaster. You can almost see how the whole story could have been generated by this idea: chef, French (who claim to have invented folded cinema of the reflexive kind), and rat. Secret recipes. Love always.This time around, the cinematic sensibilities are profoundly deeper. A deep certainty. You have to know about 2001 as a start. Kubric's interest there was the warring narrator. Whose world is telling the story, man, machine or god. There is a story, but it hardly matters. Its all about who is telling the story, whose chair you sit in as the viewer. Its a masterful work.Here, its bent only a little: mankind, machine and nature, but its folded back on the story  which here has effect. Wall-e is natural, machine in form, but more human than the humans we see. But watch how they fold it again. Its a movie about the truth in movies, how the power of cinema can reach into the real world. A handholding there and here is a handhold between the worlds. And also watch how they built movies in. This isn't accidental. When they put a movie within a movie like this, the intent is to have the watcher of the outer movie join the world of the watcher of the inner movie. Its a reliable trick to get us to invest in what we see. But they go further. When we see the humans  who are supposed to be like us but clearly aren't  we note that THEY are hypnotized by the movies in front of them and cannot see the larger world beyond, and we can.It happens to also spill over into the great narrative about how some of us can see that the planet is being destroyed and other blithely putter on. That business about saving image- laden artifacts as a memory storehouse... All these layers  yes they are engineered by what is now the most intelligent and adventuresome narrative engineering lab in a studio.All this extra introspection is used not as dry thesis, but in the service of the love story. It made it deeper, and more true. Knowing makes love true. So yes, it is effective, and fun, and deep.To compensate, the camera and space manipulation is less radical than usual.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

"Stampsfightclub","31 January 2010","The cleaning of earth has been left to sentimental robot Wall-E and when EVE visits the planet looking for plant life Wall-E's love takes him into space where mankind live.Described as Pixar's 'biggest gamble' this 2008 animation showcases a near speechless adventure in time and space, being both constantly humorous and breathtaking in its approach to get a message of human destruction across.Any viewer of any age or gender will find their own interpretation of exploration and personal meaning in this picture which, nominated for numerous Oscars, inevitably winning best animated picture, has countless reasons to view.For uniqueness this is one hat proudly sits on top of the pile. An animation showcasing humans destroying themselves and earth this has a strong encoded message specifically designed to shock other animations.Apart from Warner Brothers terribly awkward Happy Feet there has been little in animation genre to say a great deal about the earth's natural wellbeing. Even that paper thin plot crammed it in to the last twenty minutes whereas here everything is thought of and built around. The shot as the spaceship takes off from earth into the rubble surrounding it is brilliant. The nature of Wall-e himself is to clean up earth's wastage. The point of EVE is to salvage a rescue attempt. Bearing in mind this film has so little dialogue this is a remarkable achievement to get across. It is told through movements through actions and the saying ""actions speak louder than words"" is more than recognizable in this picture.Wall-e a lovable appearing robot becomes infatuated with EVE when she arrives on earth and the time the two spend together is heart-warmingly sentimental. When EVE goes into sleep mode that actions Wall-e takes to revive her are adorable, and not in a cheesy way. His holding the umbrella, the sunset picturesque montage, the trip in the boat all demonstrate a kindness and typically romantic conceptual motives for a character who has been alone for such a long time.The character development of the central protagonist plays a pivotal role in the emotional core of this film. Wall-e, a robot, has over the years developed a human personality, collecting items that mean something, caring for insects and greeting people and machines and becoming friends. And the contradictory in humans is remarkable. Like today's modern stereotype, we are obsessed with technology and food, which in this picture leads to our demise, sitting in chairs and having everything on a plate for us.The score for this picture is truly excellent also, having intertextuality from 2001 and Hello Dolly allow us to be brought into the moment and dare I say such a claim, the finest score Pixar have generated? Pixar get better with every outing and Up! was a marvellous showcase of adventure and love which just topped his outing and yet this is still one of the finest animations you will ever see.","

"rogerdarlington","9 March 2009","The odd title is actually an acronym: Waste Allocation Lift Loader, Earth-Class. This little robot unit is the last of a series originally intended to clean up a massively polluted Earth while humankind left the planet for a temporary five years which, after the failure of the project, has resulted in an absence of 700 years. The pacing and atmosphere of the movie would be remarkable for any work, let alone one of animation, with a long opening scene with little action and no dialogue. Even when another robot EVE arrives from outer space and a technical romance ensues, the dialogue is minimalist but the action accelerates at a exciting and satisfying pace.Pixar have here given us outstanding work and Andrew Stanton, who conceived the story and directed the film, deserves special praise. The film is entertaining with action, humour and great visuals, but its is also subtly instructive with clear messages about the damage to the planet and to our bodies from our adoration of consumerism, making it appealing to children and adults alike. Many science fiction classics - from ""2001"" to ""Silent Running"" - are referenced, but the treatment is so original that ""WALL·E"" itself is destined to be a classic.","

"Quinoa1984","28 June 2008","I never thought I'd say this but... WALL*E is better than Toy Story. This might not seem like such a high claim given how many other wonderful movies from PIXAR have come out over the past 13 years, particularly the ones by Brad Bird (Incredibles and Ratatouille). But since Toy Story blew open the front door for CGI animation, and stood as the pinnacle of awesome, great entertainment and film-making, I wasn't sure if anything could top it. WALL*E does by far, and then some; I'd even say that this is probably the best Disney movie that, technically, they never made. For years Disney, the studio joined at the hip (and now, practically, submissive to whatever PIXAR wants in animation), didn't want to do WALL*E, as it was a somewhat bleak science fiction movie with 3/4 of the movie not featuring any distinct human dialog at all. And, no cute animals talking either; the closest we get here is a cockroach, and, thankfully, we only get cute chirps and squees of joy.It was a risk, but after waiting for so long to make it, Andrew Stanton has what critics have been dubbing the ""M"" word: masterpiece. It works on the levels that satisfy simply for the levels of a comedy. WALL*E the character is one of those classic character straight out of Disney movies that you don't see ever done this well, or at least this purely: he's wholesome, innocent, curious, lovable and loving to the robot that comes to earth, Eva, looking for any signs of life, and we want to cheer for him every step of the way. It's a quasi-Chaplin character, if Chaplin were obsessed with a video of an old 1950s musical (somehow, in the post-apocalyptic world of 2700, still intact), and only wants to hold Eva's darling hand, despite getting into mishap after mishap and eventually leading to his trip out into space. No quirk of behavior, no amazingly adorable physical bit of comedy is unturned, and every one works, even ones that you don't see coming.At the same time, it also works as a science fiction parable, one that works splendidly for our times without pushing it down our throats. Its message is one that is general, which is why when poised around satirical overtones on the AXIOM ship- where WALL*E finds Eva bringing a plant to the ship's captain and then stopped by a HAL-9000 type of computer- it's enriched by a context we all know very well. Taking care of the planet and taking care of ourselves physically are points that are put forth without being preachy, and there's lots of good humor to go with that too (the moment when the pudgy captain finally walks, put to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, is one of the funniest damn things I've ever seen). AND, it's also an incredibly touching love story to boot; two robots who can't quite seem to get together until one sees how much the other cares for the other. The simplicity here, too, is awe-inspiring, and like a silent film brings on the tear-ducts in the final moments of suspense.So, it's a superb comedy, a fully-realized and somewhat original science fiction story (then again what is original entirely), and the best date movie of the summer. On top of this, director Andrew Stanton and the vast PIXAR team have gone once again another leap forward with their technological skills for all use in telling the story. I don't care who you are, adult, child, old dude in a wheelchair, this is top-notch film-making, some of the finest one will see in this new decade of the 21st century. While points ahead to the future of animated movies, it doesn't stop or go corrupt in basic film-making. For those who would be wary of a movie with very little dialog, don't fret: there's enough ""pure"" cinema here to suffice. It left me speechless, in-between laughing and crying and whatnot. Grade: A++","

"Rectangular_businessman","17 June 2010","""Wall-E"" along with ""Up"" must be one of the best movies released by Pixar, a company that never made a single bad film: All were enjoyable and well made, a complete pleasure to watch. ""Wall-E"" not only have an incredible animation, but also the characters were simply adorable, likable and interesting, and the history was funny and charming form beginning to end, with lots of heartwarming moments and captivating scenes, beautifully made. The plot was brilliant: Most of films aimed to children have very simplistic or silly plots, but ""Wall-E"" has a deep, meaningful story that everyone from the public could appreciate, from the youngest members of the audience, to the most cynical adults. ""Wall-E"" is simply one of the best films ever made, and it's a film that deserves everyone's recognition. I don't think that it is overrated at all; actually I think that is pretty underrated, because this film don't have any single flaw.","

"Reckno64","16 August 2019","I feel like tearing up just writing this review. It is one of the best things I have ever seen on the big screen, probably is the best thing I have ever seen in cinema. Period. I saw this when I was 10 years old, and I have never forgotten how absolutely amazed I was by it. And my love and appreciation for this film has only grown over the years. When I have kids of my own, this will be one of the first movies I show them. Animation is art, and I will forever cherish this movie.Some people may say this movie is a bit preachy, but I think it tells a very important message. One that couldn't be more important today. Planet Earth is our home, and we should take care of it. Topped off with a cute robot love story, this movie is pure perfection. I love this movie so much. It's a shame it didn't gross more at the box office......","

"haydenluz","5 January 2021","Wall E, originated, directed & written by Andrew Stanton & Peter Docter, was easily one of Pixar's best! Andrew Stanton shows once again that he is one of the best directors in the Pixar family, yet again making another instant CLASSIC! He incorporated so many magnificent shots, utilizing the perfect balance of slow, wide, and close up shots.The story was well told, being an innocent, yet complex rom-com, while having some great sentimental notes. Don't be fooled, even though this is technically a children's movie, there is so much adult entertainment, that the whole family will do nothing but fall in love with this film! The first act is one of the most enjoyable first acts Pixar has offered yet. Stanton & Docter started off building this grimmy world, set about 700 years from now, incorporating these two polar opposite, but super charming and enjoyable robots in Wall E & EVE. Their chemistry and charm is what drove this film! With the first half started off with a bang, come the second half, it gets taken to a whole other level! This is where Wall E & EVE get their defining moments, with greatly placed action.Wall E, voiced by Ben Burtt was one of Pixar's most lovable protagonist, though having this rusty, ruggid look, and not having much to say. His humanized traits, curiosity, and pure charm is what made his character so lovable. EVE, voiced by Elissa Knight, was a very intelligent robot solider, that turns out to have great character development. She basically steals the main protagonist label from Wall E, though sharing the wealth very generously. Stanton & Docter somewhat refrained from giving us true back stories to our main characters, but in return, they gave us good information to be able to infer where they comes from.The screenplay didn't have much importance in the first thirty-five minutes or so, but come the second, and mainly the third act, Pete Docter & Andrew Stanton put together a well thought-out, passionate script, incorporating a lot of heart.The cinematography and animation was absolutely GORGEOUS! The back drops were so deatiled and vibrant, really mashing well with the vibrant colors, and color contrast. The animations were stunning as always, with realistic detail in the metals, dirt, rocks, and everything in between.The score by the very popular Thomas Newman, was very dramatic, and created this great connection between the audience and the characters. The music was a pretty good touch, really coming alive in the third act.","

"Buddy-51","10 July 2008","""Wall-E,"" the latest offering from the movie-making geniuses at Pixar Studios, is a certifiable visual masterpiece that provides an endlessly inventive vision of what life might be like in the 29th Century - although, come to think of it, the term ""life"" may be something of a misnomer, for in ""Wall-E""'s post-apocalyptic image of the future, Earth has been rendered uninhabitable by pollution and garbage that have risen to toxic levels. The humans have long since fled to a high-tech way station located somewhere out in the far reaches of outer space, leaving the planet virtually deserted except for a sweet trash-compressing robot named Wall-E and his indestructible cockroach sidekick. Like all good little robots, Wall-E tirelessly performs the one function he has been programmed to carry out, even after the reason for that task no longer exists. Thus, he spends his days dutifully collecting all the litter generously strewn about the deserted city and converting it into skyscraper-high mounds of compacted trash. At night, he wiles away the hours watching an old videotape of ""Hello Dolly"" and pining away for a female companion who will alleviate his loneliness and bring some meaning to his life. Then, one fine day, his dream becomes a reality when a sleek, sexy little number named Eve - actually an environmental robot sent from the way station to see if any signs of life have returned to the planet - shows up unexpectedly in Wall-E's neighborhood.The early section of the movie, in which Wall-E wordlessly goes about his business against a haunting backdrop of a decaying infrastructure and heaps of garbage, has much of the delicate beauty and sense of wonder we find in the opening moments of ""E.T."" (whose main character obviously served as the model for Wall-E). Written and directed by Andrew Stanton and brought to life by an army of miracle-working animators too numerous to mention, ""Wall-E"" is one of those rare films that, through sheer visual design alone, is able to magically transport us to the unique little world it's created. The burgeoning romance between the two mechanical creatures is handled with a great deal of tenderness and wit, and the film is sprinkled with subtle little homages to ""West Side Story"" (in the aerial views of the city), ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Titanic"" for the more cinematically astute among us to revel and delight in. In the second half of the movie, ""Wall-E"" travels to the spaceship housing the colony of ex-patriot earthlings, where he encounters problems with a sophisticated computer who wants to control the humans and prevent them from returning to a planet that just may be becoming inhabitable once again.This is a sweet and wistful fable about not only how each individual must find his own special place in the universe but how we as a species must cherish and preserve this one special place we all call home. Yet, for all its rare and wonderful qualities, I wish I could say that I loved this movie more than I do. For like some of Pixar's other products, ""Wall-E"" is more impressive in its visuals than in its storytelling. Too often in ""Wall-E"" we feel as if the narrative is lagging a few paces behind all the technical ingenuity. Indescribably beautiful as it is to look at, the movie doesn't generate sufficient conflict and drama to pull us all the way into the story. And for that reason, ""Wall-E,"" while a true cornucopia of visual delights and easily one of the most spectacular-LOOKING films ever made, still falls just a hairsbreadth short of greatness when all is said and done.","

"comixdude3","1 July 2008","I thought that Pixar was one of the greater animation studios of the new millennium; after seeing Wall-E, I'm convinced that Pixar is the greatest modern animation studio, and perhaps one of the most talented and treasured film companies period. Writer-Director Andrew Stanton has not only managed to create a technical marvel with Wall-E, pushing the boundaries of computer animation technology to the limits, but also a work of pure art that's more intelligent, heartfelt, thought provoking, and flat-out masterful than any movie in years.The film start's off on a simultaneously sweet and sour note: The opening reveals the gorgeous backdrop of galaxies and stars, with music from the movie 'Hello-Dolly!' overlapping it all in a sugary visual treat. Not seconds later, the camera traverses space to slowly close in on the planet Earth which, 700 years in to the future, has gained a sickly green tint to it along with an orbital atmosphere of pure garbage. Further zooming reveals a desolated city (New York, maybe?) its buildings and bridges rotted way. The entire opening is very reminiscent of the recent I Am Legend, except much, much more ruined. It is however, technically beautiful; the images are so photo realistic that you're amazed that they've been generated by computer. The only remnants of humanity are monstrous skyscrapers of compacted trash and billboards aplenty advertising the bright and colorful, yet somehow ominous company known as Buy n' Large, a thinly veiled Wal-Mart clone. And, of course, Wall-E itself.Wall-E is far more than a mere 'it', however. Through hundreds of nuanced and heartfelt animation quirks, as well as the ""voice"" given by Ben Burtt, Star-Wars veteran and creator of another famed beeping robot named R2-D2, Wall-E has been imbued with enough life to fill three-dozen cheap summer kids flicks, all without ever saying more than two or three actual words.Wall-E has been operating for centuries, long after his other Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class counterparts have shut down or broken apart, scouring the wastelands of earth and compacting the land's garbage in to neat little cubes.It's a lonely job, with the little robot's only companion being a spunky little cockroach. Wall-E has over the years collected an impressive amount of junk with which he passes the time, including lighters, toys, spare parts, and an old VHS copy of Hello Dolly!, which is Wall-E's instructor in the ways of life, love, and keenly choreographed dance. Indeed, Wall-E gazes upon two lovers holding hands and the look in his binocular eyes is both heartbreaking and beautiful. It all changes however, when a beautiful robot from the human colony in space arrives; her name is EVE. Despite here tendencies to blow up anything that moves, Wall-E is smitten at first sight, and EVE comes to eventually share those feelings. After taking note of a very unique possession of Wall-E's however, EVE reports back to the Earth ship Axiom and is whisked away back in to space. Wall-E, being as devoted as he is, follows her into the unknown, and it is there that the movie really gets going, with Wall-E and EVE taking part in an adventure with the fate of humanity itself in the balance. Characters like the Captain of the Axiom (voiced by Jeff Garlin) appearing to flesh out the film's plot, as well as a gaggle of amusing ""rogue"" robots that aide Wall-E and EVE in their quest. As the movie develops, however, the leading characters' romance becomes the core of the movie, with Wall-E and EVE's love being one of the few genuinely lovely and convincing romances of recent cinema. The touching moments Wall-E shares with EVE in his workshop, as well as their first ""kiss"" preceding a marvelous dance through space highlight a relationship that tugs at the heartstrings and moistens the eyes far more than movies like Fool's Gold or What Happens in Vegas. The romance between the two leads is the very soul of the movie, and could not have been better executed. The film is gorgeous to boot: With colors and images that dazzle and linger long after the film is over. Films like No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood, as beautiful as they are, seem to revel in the gloom of browns and blacks. Wall-E, on the other is vibrant and alive, turning even the beginning's post-apocalyptic wasteland in to a marvel. The biggest surprise of Wall-E, however, would be its surprising amount of maturity. Wall-E deals with themes of pollution, rampant consumerism, societal complacency and obesity, media desensitization, and other themes that would frankly fly over a child's head. Kids will see a world full of people who are humorously fat and happy; older members of the audience, however, will see a society that tells of a future not centuries ahead of us but perhaps only decades. The overblown laziness and rampant consumerism is evident already today, and the notion of Wall-E's future being so similar is funny yes, but also a touch unnerving.It is for this reason that I hold Wall-E in such high esteem: It is a heartfelt work of inarguable art that not only entertains but holds enough conscience and commentary to get even the most casual of moviegoer thinking about the future. It is beautiful and it is heartbreaking. It is funny and it is also a tad scary. It has two supposedly life-less robots teaching humanity the very meaning of being human, as well as learning the meaning of true love themselves. It made me laugh, it made me (almost) cry. It has the distinction of being Pixar's best movie, as wells as the hands down best movie of the year (so far); an almost perfect, if not completely perfect summer movie that kids and adults will almost assuredly love.And it is also one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.","

"socrates99","10 July 2008","I was ready to be wowed by this film and the first 20 minutes or so were ecstatic for me. Sometimes I think there's no comparison between Japanese anime and the stuff Hollywood puts out, but this was clearly inspired and ingenious film making that can hold its own against Japan's best. But then the film has trouble dealing with the problems it poses, not unlike how we're failing to deal with the REAL problems of over consumption and the mindless accumulation of waste that it alludes to. The setting changes and the story takes a rather depressing turn into frenetic activity that made me anxious to see it over. It's not that the film's point is misguided or even over sold. It's just that it's a different issue and not necessarily a consequence of the first more successfully contrived part. That second issue is our becoming overly serviced by robots in a blind pursuit of entertainment and sensation. Still, the creation of a robot with a completely engaging personality is so brilliant and indelible that no one should miss this somewhat mixed film. Clearly the people who made this have their head's on straight and have a better vision of what could result from our culture than some of our most highly respected leaders.","

"TOMNEL","27 June 2008","My favorite animated movie was, and still is The Nightmare Before Christmas, but Wall-E comes in at close second. Pixar outdid themselves in every possible way, and it seems that though they've done that with each of their films, this one stands above the others. It's cute, without those lame sappy moments that cause you to uncomfortably stare at the floor. It's emotional, with some scenes even leaving a lump in my throat. The animation is amazing and the story is both inventive and original (for the most part). Wall-E is the quintessential Pixar film...no, it's the quintessential animated movie.Wall-E (or Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth class) is a lonely robot on futuristic Earth. The year is around 2800 and all the humans have ""temporarily"" been taken off of Earth into a space cruise where they are awaiting Earth to be cleaned up. Wall-E's only friend is a cockroach, and he lives in a little storage shelter where he keeps interesting items he finds in the trash he compacts. One day a spaceship drops off another robot, this one named EVE. Her mission is to find plant life on Earth, which would signal that the humans can return. Wall-E is fascinated by EVE, and more than anything just wants to hold her hand, like in his favorite musical, Hello Dolly. EVE sees a plant that Wall-E had previously found, and they both end up being taken up into space on the space cruise ship. All the humans on board have lost track of reality, don't walk or do any exercise, and they are all morbidly obese. Wall-E and EVE end up having to save the plant life they brought up to show to the ship's captain so they can go back to Earth, but the ship computer doesn't like that idea.I have no critiques for this film. As I've said, this is about as close to perfect as you can come, I'll just explain what I really liked. I enjoyed the romance between Wall-E and EVE, which was so sweet, sort of sad at times, and more real than the typical teen comedy romance. The human characters were great. Jeff Garlin plays the ship captain and does an excellent job. One of the best scenes in the movie has the captain studying up on Earth wide eyed, learning all the things humans (now adays) have known since we were infants. John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy voice two humans who face reality before the others and get off their fat rears to have some fun and take a moment to notice the stars. The animation is the best Pixar's ever done, and even with the cartoonish designs of the characters, sometimes I'd forget I was watching a cartoon. Wall-E, as a character, was an amazing lead. Amazing in that he carried the movie flawlessly, and made me truly feel for the poor guy, and amazing in that the only thing that he says in the movie, along with some grunts and squeals, is ""EVE-a!"". I have no clue how Pixar molds these likable characters, but they did a fantastic job. I'd see it 10 more times in the theaters, and I hope it makes a billion at the box office.Pixar's done it again! They hit gold, more so than any of their other pictures, and Wall-E ranks up there with one of the best animated pictures of all time. It was the first film in months to leave me 100% satisfied. I loved it! My rating: **** out of ****. 100 mins. Rated G.","

It made me feel like a kid again, and recreated the feelings I had watching ""Star Wars"" or ""E.T."" for the very first time, which would account for the countless scenes that made me tear up for vaguely nostalgic reasons.Despite the fact that we spend most of our time with mechanical robots, a love of humanity and of the earth pulses from every frame of ""Wall-E"". Movies, television and the news media spend so much time trying to convince us that the world is a terrible place to live, that one rickety little robot with big eyes telling us otherwise comes as a revelation.Grade: A+","

"djansen24","13 November 2010","This is so far my favorite Pixar film. It expresses so much in its running time. It is truly a film for all ages and audiences that dazzles the eye and takes your breath away. The attention to detail is awesome which makes the slower pace of the first act of the film absolutely mesmerizing. And that is the key to Wall-E. While the storyline is trimmed down to razor tight telling (that is, not wasting time on what is not essential to the story and themes), it feels open and relaxing. Some of the best moments come when Eve and Wall-e simply fly together or gaze on the stars. The conflict in the movie grabs ahold of you and pulls at your heart strings while leaving a sense of wonder in you. That's because there is a sense of hope and love that permeates the story; exactly what you expect from a film primarily targeted for children. But adults will relate to because of the depth of the storytelling. Andrew Stanton and crew should feel great about what they have made here. It is not only good sci-fi and good animation, but it rejuvenates you while you watch it. My 4 and 3 year old absolutely love this movie and so do my wife and I. Don't miss it!","

Going over the beautiful CGI in my head, I'm still in awe of how the designers portrayed Wall.E's integrated world and their attention to detail will serve as a benchmark for years. That said, I'm less impressed by the simple and very predictable plot. Pixar/Disney married state-of-the-art visuals with a worn plot line from an early childhood fairy tale. I'm guessing the target audience for this movie is somewhere around 6th graders. Great summer family fare but not a great movie if you want something more substantial in terms of plot and character development.","

"Jay_Exiomo","19 August 2008","In the distant future, the Earth has been an inhabitable wasteland and humans are now living in artificial environments in space and left to clean the trash are waste disposal robots named WALL·E. Almost 700 years later - 2815 to be exact - only one WALL·E (voice created by the film's sound designer Ben Burtt) remains functional and it begins to show signs of sentience and emotions, longing for someone to share a romantic touch with.Enter EVE (Elissa Knight), a feminine-like probing unit sent to Earth by Axiom, one of the human cargoes in space. WALL·E falls in love with Eve, and this sets for an adventure in space.Much has been said about how the film lacks dialog for the first hour and relies solely on gestures and emotions shown by the robots. It's also grimmer than previous Pixar films and save for a cockroach, WALL·E does a Will Smith in the first few minutes of the film, interacting with no one but his environment. Sounds like a turnoff especially for the little ones but director Andrew Stanton shows enough resourcefulness to use what's on screen to produce a more emotionally resonant and believable spark (pardon the pun) between the two robots than most real-life actors could ever dream of grasping.Serving also as some sort of a cautionary tale about human's role in preserving our environment, the film does so in a subtle and amusing manner without resorting to the mawkish approach that's prevalent in other otherwise well-meaning-ed films. As usual of Pixar, the quality of animation is superb, which is, really, just a cherry on top of the cake.Inasmuch as I hate to sound like a fanboy who will throw superlatives on just about anything Pixar churns out, I have to say that the geniuses behind the animation studio have done it again - create a movie that's not only magnificent to look at, but with a soul as well to back it up.","

"zkonedog","11 March 2017","Some movies are good because they take a tried and true formula and add a unique twist. Others are good because they do something completely different and unexpected. ""Wall-E"" falls squarely into the latter category.The story is simple: In a post-apocalyptic world, a trash-collecting robot (WALL-E) wanders the desolate terrain. One day, a visitor (EVE) descends from the heavens and involves WALL-E in a wild adventure to once more bring life to the barren planet.This entire film is so different from anything Disney/Pixar had produced to that point, yet the overall quality is still top-notch. The story is simple (yet charming), the characters are innocent (halfway in you'll forget that you're essentially watching robots), and the visuals are both unique and spectacular at the same time.Perhaps the hallmark of this fun little film, however, are the numerous sights gags it perpetuates. The Disney/Pixar team knew that since the fare was robots, the ""goofiness"" factor could be upped for this effort. On multiple occasions, whether you're four or forty-four, you'll find yourself chuckling at something that just transpired on-screen.Thus, I highly recommend watching this film with the kiddie of your choice. It toes the line between the intellectual humor of Toy Story and the slapstick of Finding Nemo, all the while providing genuine laughs and heart along the way.","

"GusherPop","17 May 2023","Pixar's ""WALL-E"" is an enthralling animated film, a visual wonderment and a decent science-fiction story. It works largely without spoken dialogue, making it easy to cross language barriers and tell a planetary story. It is also a film that can easily cross language barriers, as it tells a planetary story. WALL-E is a solar-powered robot that is the last of the functioning solar-powered robots. He scoops up trash, shovels it into his belly, compresses it into a square, and climbs on his tractor treads to the top of his latest skyscraper to place it neatly on the pile. The skyscrapers are constructed out of garbage, compacted into squares or bales and piled on top of one another. WALL-E's age-old routine is shattered when a sleek spaceship appears in his world. He is scooped up by the ship and returned to the orbiting spaceship Axiom, along with his most recent discovery: a tiny, perfect green plant, which he transplanted to an old shoe. The movie has a wonderful look, with a color palette that is bright and cheerful, but not too pushy, and a tiny bit realistic at the same time. The drawing style is Comic Book Cool, perfected in the funny comics more than in the superhero books. The design of WALL-E, for whom I felt a curious affection, is rusty and hard-working and plucky, and expresses his personality with body language and (mostly) with the binocular-like video cameras that serve as his eyes. The movie draws on a tradition going back to the earliest days of Walt Disney, who reduced human expressions to their broadest components and found ways to translate them to animals, birds, bees, flowers, trains and everything else. The film ""Finding Nemo"" is directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton, who wrote and directed ""Finding Nemo"". It involves ideas, not mindless scenarios, and involves a little work on the part of the audience and thought. It could be especially stimulating to younger viewers, and could have been a great science-fiction film.","

"dbborroughs","4 July 2008","This is the story of Wall-E a robot who is alone working on earth cleaning up the polluted planet. One day he finds a plant and takes it home. When one day a space ship lands Wall-E meets EVE who has been left on the planet for some reason. The reason is to find signs that plants are returning, so when Wall-E shows EVE the planet she sends a signal for pick up and is whisked back to a space ship where all of mankind has been living-with Wall-E in pursuit.This is a mostly wordless feature film not only about robots who fall in love but also what it means to be human and what it means to be alive. Its also a satire, of sorts, about the fat lazy people that we in the West have become.Technically this is one of the most beautifully animated films that Pixar has done. Its wonderful to look at. The places and spaces and the characters are all beautifully rendered. The film creates more than good number of real characters, both robots and people and its the characters that make the film worth seeing.The problem is that the story is a bit of a mess. On the one hand you have the central story of the romance of Wall-E and EVE, but you also have this glaring social commentary looming over everything. From the polluted Earth of the first half to the fat people in space during the second. Which is more important? To me its the romance and its there that the film shines. Frankly I got teary during any number of sequences dealing with the romance. Unfortunately the ""get the plant so we can go home story"" kind of goes nowhere smoothly as situation keeps being inserted again and again to keep it going. On top of that we have the not so hidden messages about how lazy we all are and how happiness is ""not following the path"". The story goes from well told story about Wall-e and Eve to the Captain (who is wonderful and under utilized-I wanted more of him) to the two human ""lovers"" John and Mary who begin to see life out side of their hoover-chairs.There is this really good robot romance stuck in here thats gotten lost somewhere along the way. I was sobbing during the four minute trailer that was floating around a few months ago that focused beautifully on the romance. I went from not being sure if it would work to being sure they hit it out of the park. There's this wonderful simple story locked in there with all this not as wonderful stuff around it. (A word of warning- the trailers give a good number of gags away) Yes I've complain about every Pixar Movie. (Toy Story 2 isn't as good as the first one, Bugs Life is too slow, Monsters Inc was not quite Toys Story, Nemo didn't completely thrill me, Incredibles is too long, Cars is too simple and their eyes wig me out, Ratatouille, while very good, isn't the the great second coming many claimed) Say What you will I own all but A Bugs Life. Other than Cars I think all have improved with time (thanks to the critical claim that this Pixar is the next big thing no loner being considered) And while I do think Ratatouille has too much story and needs to be trimmed down, I don't think that any of them have as many problems story wise as this (certainly none has as many character needing exploration and fleshing out).What is this film about-really I don't know. I adore the romance and wish I had someone to take to see it since its so charming, but at the same time...I don't know it all doesn't come together for me.Perhaps I could see some of the story line too clearly. I could tell what the next shot was or the next motion would be. Perhaps I saw too many jokes in the trailers and commercials. Maybe it was the god awful Hello Dolly clip playing over and over and over. Maybe it was the one movie too many that played Le Vie En Rose. I don't know. there is something about the film that doesn't allow it to hang together for me. I admire its construction but I don't love the result.I still like it. I'd give it between 6.5 to 7 out of 10, but at the same time the parts are better then the whole.Go see it and make up your own mind-if nothing else there are some really neat things in it.","

"WikusVanDeMerwe","28 June 2008","We live in a consumerist era. As any visit to a metropolitan area will prove, there is the unfaltering marriage of burgeoning commerce to a burgeoning population. Retail giants now provide services that would take more than a handful of independent stores to supply and this umbrella is continually widening. But how far can this consumerism go before it consumes us? This is where Wall-E begins, setting up the most scathing, yet perhaps most accurate futurist take on consumerism's affect on society in any animated film I've seen to date. In fact, I can't recall any film in the last several years that has taken this approach so seriously. Andrew Stanton once again throws us straight into a darkly themed film, but once again there are serious points to be had. At the outset of the film, we are introduced to a world where the skyscrapers that once housed the internal workings of business are dwarfed and surrounded by skyscrapers built of that very business' refuse. WALL-E spends his days continuously collecting and compacting the mountains of garbage that fill the streets of the city and adding it the trash skyscrapers, piece by piece. We learn very early on that this is the last functional bot of its kind, and perhaps, the only living machine on the planet. But there is something special about this surviving Wall-E; this robot performs its programmed tasks, but it has also become a curious being, collecting and organizing interesting items seen day by day. Wall-E is, essentially, the last bit of humanity left on Earth, since every other human being is either dead or living aboard the space cruise liner, the Axiom.But things change once EVE arrives on Earth. In true fashion with his curious nature, the sight of EVE is enthralling to Wall-E. Here is something new from humanity, not just the garbage and trinkets left behind for Wall-E to sift through and compact. What begins here is the most innocent yet basic of love stories I have seen or read in many years. There is a purity to Wall-E's almost hypnotic and naive interest in EVE. I don't mean this in any religious terms, but rather in the vein that neither robot has prior knowledge of love or adoration, apart from Wall-E's surviving betamax tape of Hello Dolly! as his primary source of inspiration. Everything else is rooted in simple curiosity, but it is amazing how far just that can develop one's character.Wall-E interacts with everything he finds in a very primal manner (the source of that curiosity), slowly learning about the things he finds by essentially playing with them until something happens. EVE is the dedicated but markedly emotional counterpart to Wall-E's primal self. She performs her tasks at the expense of taking notice of Wall-E. By the time she finally catches on to Wall-E's affection, the programmed side of herself sets off their exciting journey into space.Once things set into full-swing, this film does not let go of you. EVE and Wall-E are quite a dynamic duo, although not the romantic pair envisioned in Wall-E's mind for most of the film. I won't go into any further analysis here, lest I spoil the fun for anyone wishing to go see it. But I must say that the fact that we see two robots, two human creations, act as the primary humanizing force is entirely effective and what makes me love this film so much. The overall message of the film emerges from the dark outset and even darker conclusion... The ending credits are a must-view for anyone who sees the film. There is a very emotional sequence of progressions that twice put me to tears for its poignancy and in light of the beginning of the film. The way this movie ends is the same way it begins: at the core it's all about WALL-E and the things we recognize in him as inherently human: his funny personality, his compulsion toward the good, his child-like curiosity and naivety, his sense of loneliness that he tries (and fails) at anesthetizing with psychological comforts and companion place-holders.On other notes, the soundtrack is Newman's definitive work in cinema. I didn't think I would say this anytime post Finding Nemo, but it really is true. EVERY bit of music supports the film's imagery and tone while also helping shape it note by note. There is not a wasted note in this film.Also, the visual imagery is utterly beautiful and affecting. Skyscrapers of compacted garbage, the collections in Wall-E's trailer, the outer heavens, the POV's of EVE and Wall-E... All are fantastic. The cinematography is also top-notch. They might have used the back to foreground focus a bit much, but just the fact that they had Roger Deakins consult on their almost perfected simulation cinematography as well as Stanton's directorial 'mindprint' of the film speaks volumes for the studio. It is all found and spoken for in the final print.The thing about this movie is that is able to speak so much without much dialogue. Stanton has obviously learned a great deal in how to use the visual image as powerfully as possible.Verdict: Pixar gets another 10/10. They make films that speak to me in ways no other animation studio ever pulls off. The message may always be positive, but that doesn't mean the trials of Pixar characters are ever just plain and simple affairs. Stanton produced something very very special and endearing here. While the paint may be of a love story and two curious robots, he has captured nothing short of the core of our positive human nature in two inanimate objects. This is a meaningful and important film. How far can we let our lives be simplified before our own creations become more human than ourselves?","

"Kamurai25","13 August 2020","A must watch, will watch again, and definitely recommend for everyone, all ages.The first 30 minutes or so of this movie are pure and perfect magic. They establish the world, Wall-E, the human race with next to no dialogue.Wall-E and Eve meeting is wonderfully trip of social anxiety in different personalities and a great metaphor for living together while being different.Once on the axiom, the entire movie shifts seemlessly, and it is one heavy metaphor after the next about America and the human race without it once being the focus of the story.If you ever needed a movie that ""does"" and not ""says"", this is your example, it's how world building should be done.While I think I could literally talk about this movie for hours, I don't want to spoil anything else by talking about it here other than this is a near perfect movie to me.Watch, enjoy, be well.","

The music in this movie was very sad. Overall I love this movie, it has so much going for it. You won''t be disappointed.

"raypdaley182","5 July 2008","Pixar have done it again. I'm going on the record here, this is THE best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. It's simple, beautiful, enchanting, it has a message & has memorable characters.Wall-e (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) is a robot. His job is to tidy up rubbish. A very noble cause & even more so when it's all the rubbish we humans left behind before blasting off into the stars to leave The Earth in hope that nature could regenerate itself. And this is Wall-e's (he pronounces it Wally) huge task.I assume centuries ago there were millions like him (you get to see 1 that has broken down that he scavenges parts from) & they all compacted the rubbish until they broke down, leaving only Wall-e left to continue the job on his own over a period of 700 years during which time he became self aware & developed a persona with only a cockroach for company.The film looks amazing, Wall-e is based the design of Johnny 5 from Short Circuit, he also has elements of E.T in his persona along with the robots Huey, Lewie & Dewey from Silent Running. If you were to take all the best parts of those movies & put them together then you'd start to get close to Wall-e.Wall-e is alone until a probe lands on Earth containing Eve (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) who is there to search for life. And what does she do as soon as she encounters a hint of life? She shoots at it. That was the cockroach. And again when she meets Wall-e who falls in love with her and helps her to achieve her mission when he finds a plant growing under the rubbish he clears.This means Wall-e has to protect Eve from the elements until her ship returns to take her back to the last remnants of Humanity. A society living in complete apathy, reliant on robots for everything and have atrophied to the point where they are even unable to walk or sit up without assistance.Eventually we find out that 700 years in space have caused this to occur & that the autopilot was given orders never to return to Earth as it was declared uninhabitable. Obviously Eve's return with the plant throws a spanner in the works and we spend a short time having Eve & Wall-e being declared rogue robots, being hunted down for destruction so the Autopilot can cover up that life has returned to Earth.The film does end with the ship returning the humans to Earth & Eve having to repair Wall-e after it seems he has been destroyed but her repair job is too good and he no longer is aware like before. We do have a happy ending as Wall-e regains his awareness and the Humans decide to help earth rebuild itself and get it green again.There is a strong message behind this film about pollution and the destruction of the ecosystem but its never rammed down your throat or made to seem preachy. It's done tactfully & thoughtfully and does make you leave the film thinking about the issues. M.Night Shamaylan tried to achieve this in ""The Happening"" & failed miserably. Perhaps he should take a leaf out of Pixar's book and not try so hard.A simple film with a very strong idea, an excellent & well thought out plot with a positive message and strong ending all put Pixar's message across very well. As Disney were involved, sadly there are moments of too much saccharine but the very strong film makes these bearable.I would recommend this to everyone!","

"whatever_123","2 October 2009","DO NOT listen to those who say this is a bad movie because there's hardly any dialog. Everything in this movie is so perfect, it doesn't NEED dialog!! The animation was so REAL. Everything was perfect!! The landscapes were beautiful, the technology was creative, smooth, and incredibly flawless, the robots were great! I thought it was interesting how real humans were used in small parts of the movie, and the humans in the future were animated, shown as really large, lazy people we may become in the future, if we're not careful. As soon as the movie started, I fell in love with Wall-e. He was possible the most adorable thing I have ever seen! His character was so deep, you could forget he's not human. Wall-e has the biggest heart of any of the characters I've seen. You have to be insane to not love Wall-e. I really enjoyed seeing the chemistry develop between EVE and Wall-e. They are so different, EVE being a fast, powerful, advanced robot, and Wall-e being a sweet, simple, rusty little trash-compacting robot, and they work together PERFECTLY!!! They are the cutest couple in Pixar history. The messages in the story were very well-presented. It showed what could happen to our planet if we trashed it and took it for granted and what could happen if we all get too lazy. The perfect combination of humor, CGI, heart, and lessons to be learned, this is truly a Pixar triumph.","

"ClaytonDavis","30 June 2008","Animation is a key element in the lives of children but somewhere around adolescence, a young person feels they're ""too mature"" or ""too cool"" to be watching ""cartoons."" Then a change occurs in adulthood, which the same young person misses something from their childhood and a film they watched while playing with Lego's brings them back to that. As of late, animated films have tried to be something their not, perhaps lost their spark. In the new millennium, I haven't really experienced the Bambi, The Lion King, or The Fox and the Hound of our time. Finding Nemo and The Incredibles raised the bar but still hadn't been the perfect dose of entertainment, writing, and emotion. WALL-E, has achieved where its predecessors failed.WALL-E is the most touching, real, emotionally moving film this year so far. The film is about a little robot named WALL-E, (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) who has become exceptionally lonely on the desolate planet of Earth, that has become a wasteland of filth, debris, and pollution. Life has ceased to exist on the once populated planet until a rocket lands and drops off a ""surprise,"" to say the least. Enters our heroin, which might be an understatement, EVE, a robot with an edge, that is searching for ""something"" that might be the key to life's existence. But alas, WALL-E falls in love with her charm, wit, and blaster gun and when circumstances force her to be picked up, WALL-E will travel across the galaxy to find his love.WALL-E makes a statement loud and clear about today's political factors, from pollution to exercise, love, life, it speaks of it all in volumes without any words; it uses images to baffle the viewer as we are thrust through the film. Writer and Director Andrew Stanton creates wonderful details as we are engulfed into WALL-E's world and within seconds of the film starting, fall in completely in love with the robot.The film doesn't pretend to be something it's not and Stanton isn't afraid to let the film be both for the mature and the innocence of our youth. With limited dialogue, Stanton takes a chance of losing his viewers but rest assured, there is never a dull moment and while the film does lose a little flavor from the start, resonance of childhood and contentment fill the viewer in images of awe and splendor.As the already declared by many, Animated Film frontrunner of the Academy Awards, the film studio Pixar may have a winner on its hands to make a strong push for Best Picture. Not since Beauty and the Beast has an animated film been nominated for Best Picture and we've had some potential candidates over the years. But with the induction of the Best Animated Feature category, voters feel there's no need to validate the films twice so to speak. WALL-E is technically beautiful which makes it a contender in the Sound and Editing categories, and Stanton is more than just the writer of the film as he directs the film with power and precise. I'd go so far as to say this is the best directed animated film I've ever seen. That is where Stanton's magic is, his direction, but writing is definitely a strong suit for the film as well. We'll have to wait for the upcoming awards season to see how it plays out.But go and catch WALL-E on the big screen, and enjoy the masterpiece for what it is and the wonderful short film at the beginning of the film which is a treat for all.***½/****","

"Tweekums","2 January 2011","Having enjoyed Pixar's 'Incredibles' and 'Toy Story' trilogy I was keen to see 'Wall-E' when it was on television. The reviews I'd heard suggested that I'd be in for a treat and they weren't wrong; Pixar may make films that are aimed at a younger audience but adults are unlikely to feel childish if they watch them; this is especially true of 'Wall-E'. Set in a distant future where the Earth has been abandoned by humanity because pollution and the build up of garbage has made the planet uninhabitable one small robot toils to tidy up the mess left behind; that robot is Wall-E. Throughout his days he crushes the rubbish into cubes then stacks them in towers that have come to dwarf the city's long abandoned skyscrapers. When he finds items he likes such as an old Rubik's Cube or a small weed he takes it back to his 'home' to store. His existence is changed one day when a spaceship arrives and drops off a shiny new robot who we later learn is called EVE; the two of them become friends and everything goes well for them until he shows her the plant, then she takes it, puts it inside her and shuts down. It appears that her mission was to search for plant life then wait to be retrieved. When this happens she is taken away on the space ship, not wanting to be without her Wall-E clings on and is taken back to the Axiom; the ship where what is left of humanity lives. The people aren't like people now though; they are all over-weight which is hardly surprising as they don't seem to get out of their hover chairs and are waited on by a variety of robots. Once here Wall-E and EVE's adventures are just beginning as they must avoid the security systems and deliver the plant to the scanner which the ships autopilot is determined to stop them doing as it had been informed that Earth would never be suitable for resettlement.As always with Pixar films the animation was just about flawless, I was surprised however that it was not 100% animated; the various adverts and messages recorded at the time of Earth's abandonment featured live action actors, this was an inspired move as it only served to emphasise how much humanity had changed when we saw the fat CGI people later on. The minimal use of dialogue was a brave idea that worked for me, one would have though that having no dialogue spoken by a main character in the opening twenty minutes and not a huge amount afterwards would lead to a boring film but it was in fact engrossing. The character designs were good; the beaten up look of Wall-E, which reminded me of 'Number Five' from 'Short Circuit' contrasted beautifully with the clean modern EVE. While there were a few nods to other films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey the viewer is unlikely to feel they are missing something if they don't get the reference; as Pixar don't feel it necessary to fill their films with lots of pop culture references I can see this and their other films being watched for decades to come in the way old Disney films can still entertain today's children.","

"theskulI42","20 July 2008","From Curious George to E.T. and right on down to the present day, cinema-goers have always had a strong affinity towards, for lack of a better term, ""curious little critters"", small animals, aliens or other beings who are simultaneously inquisitive and clueless about the ways of Earth, and are preferably also quite clumsy, and Wall-E, as a character and as a movie, delivers in spades. Taking a pratfall as effortlessly as Keaton, and doing a terrified double take better than the most racist of cinema servitude, the sentient being, whose job it is to pick up and compact trash on a desolate future Earth, is equally fascinated by the inner workings of lightbulbs, Twinkies, garbage can lids and iPods, but can't seem to cover his head, as countless manner of things continually seem to be crashing down upon it. This mundane existence is shattered by a mysterious craft that deploys a scanning probe, another sentient being, this time with an infectious giggle and an itchy trigger finger, named Eve.Pixar has an uncanny knack for turning familiarity into universiality. Case in point: the love story presented in ""WALL-E"" is a story that doesn't take a single turn that hasn't been preordained by 80 years of cinema history, but Pixar still manages to turn it on its ear: The love story here is between robots, and our protagonists, despite only having model numbers and call signs for names, and literally knowing four words between them (two, discounting their own names), are more human than any couple seen on the silver screen in some time, and when life and responsibility intervene, there's a sense of heartbreak and loss seldom possible with flesh and blood.The second act takes us as far in the other direction as possible, as Eve is picked back up by her ship, and Wall-E hitches a ride on the side, desperate for his only love. The scenes of travel here function as both a sort of montage, a transition between acts, but also serve to provide the audience with what may be the most awe-inspiring presentation of space seen since ""2001"", which also gets an immediately recognizable character nod that could work as a gap to that film when they're older. What he finds when the ship arrives is a completely autonomous society, co-existing between morbidly obese humans on floating chairs, no longer required to do anything of effort, even communicating on viewscreens directly across from each other, coexisting with all manner of robotic denizens, who have far more of the human experience than their living counterparts, including frustrated custodians, tough-as-nails security officers and even a mental health ward.I won't take the time to explain the particulars of the humans' situation, or any more of the plot, because part of the fun is exploring for yourself. Pixar has never been one to skimp on the details, and every inch of the screen is filled with glorious colors, wondrous intricacies and charming touches that just add to the amazing glory unfolding before you. The fact that you know what's going to happen is less of a detriment and more of a comfort, much like watching a old video of your favorite sports' team's greatest triumph: You may know all the ups and down, but on screen, it's always happening for the first time, and damnit, it feels that way too, a testament to the skill, expertise and above all HEART, something Pixar has always seemed to possess just a little bit more of than everybody else, like they discovered some hidden secret on how to entertain everybody, to transcend labels like ""children's movie"", ""animated movie"" or even ""family movie"", to where all you have to say is ""Pixar"", and the inference is there: You're going to love it, and Pixar has stepped up to say, ""Don't give up on 2008 just yet."" As for ""WALL-E"", the message is clear: All you need is love (All together now!). All you need is love (Everybody!). All you need is love, love...Love is all you need.{Grade: 9.5/10 (A) / #1 (of 53) of 2008 / #187 of all time}","

That one was X-Rated (NC-17 today).Of course, I had to watch this, not because it won Best Animated Feature Film at the Academy Awards, but because there was a push to get it nominated for Best Picture period. It did win a couple of Best Picture awards from film critics, but the Academy wasn't buying it.I feel that it did meet the requirements for consideration as Best Picture, as it presented a story that was interesting and credible, and just had animated robots instead of humans. Of course, nominating it for Best Picture means someone would be left out, and I can't see that as there were other films that had a better claim to be included.It was charming, tender, funny, and exciting. A film that is worth watching over and over.","

"ivanmessimilos","6 January 2022","A wonderful cartoon for children, but also for adults. Still relevant in its subject matter and the message it sends us. There is no dialogue for the first half hour or so, but that's why those scenes are strong, emotional, and maybe even more powerful than those containing words (e.g. When Wall E initially finds certain things among the trash). I found links to the 2001 Odyssey that were deliberately placed like the first half hour of a movie, the main robot in a spaceship, or music near the end. Not only is this a great cartoon for kids but it is also a great SF that adults can enjoy as well. It didn't lose anything when I watched it again, in fact it may be even better.

"Laakbaar","19 February 2014","There's not much I can add after almost a thousand reviews. I agree with the collective wisdom of IMDb users. This is a wonderfully written and beautifully animated science-fiction movie with lovable, human-like robot characters.Yes, I suppose children might enjoy this film, but it is also aimed directly at adults. None of the characters in this movie are children (of the human, animal or robot kind). As charming and cartoonish as it is, ""Wall-E"" is a rather intelligent, harsh indictment of American consumer culture. One of the themes is environmentalism; another is humanity's growing dependence on its machines.A huge amount of work must have gone into inventing and creating this film's version of the future Earth, and also the world of ""Axiom"". The way the creators were able to anthropomorphise the robots was remarkably creative. The movie reflects our own ambivalence: we love these little bots, but at the same time we see the danger. Can we ever live without them?Six years after release, this film still delights and amazes. It's difficult to think of a single thing to criticize about it.I can't say that I am a die-hard Pixar fan per se. Many of their films (eg Cars) don't work for me at all. This is one of the best of the bunch, right up there beside ""Finding Nemo"". Kudos to Andrew Stanton.After seeing it three times now, I'm tempted to give it 10, but 9 will do for now.","

"StevePulaski","12 October 2013","WALL-E is perhaps one of the most subversive films by Pixar Animation Studios and one of the most significant animated films in many years. The film is comprised of little dialog, breathtakingly clear, but often dirty visuals that contradict the bubbly, colorful palette of colors we're used to seeing in contemporary animation, and can be seen as a showcase for several motifs and deep themes.We open in the year 2805, where Earth has become a haven for mass amounts of garbage thanks to extreme levels of consumerism perpetuated by a massive corporation called ""Buy N Large."" Earth's population was evacuated in the early 2100's to reside in certain ships in space. Left behind were ""WALL-E"" robots, small trash-compactors that would make identical cubic blocks out of the trash left behind by humans before stacking them into gigantic skyscrapers. Eventually, all the bots died off, except for one, who is still mindlessly operating and compacting trash day-after-day.WALL-E lives in a storage truck, kept cozy by pieces from human civilization that bring him comfort. One day, he is brought more comfort by discovering EVE, a much-more advanced robot who is deployed from the Buy N Large spaceship to track down vegetation on Earth. WALL-E meets and is attracted by EVE, and the two form a bond, communicating through ambiguous sounds and the occasional disjointed line of robotic dialog.There is hardly any dialog during the first act of the film; the second act is populated by a bit more than the first and the third is largely devoted to speaking because our focus has shifted from the dilapidated Earth to the more populous Axiom spaceship. Much of the film is largely focused on showcasing the variety of sounds WALL-E and EVE make, leaving the viewer to utilize those little bits of sound as the main point of reference when it comes to trying to define the emotion and the feelings the characters are currently going through. The sound design was largely conducted by Ben Burtt, the so-called ""godfather of sound"" for the film industry, and his meticulous craft shows. A viewing of the making of WALL-E reminds - or perhaps informs us - that when animation is made, nothing has a sound. Animated character movements are, by default, silent and every sound, down to the footsteps, must be done in real life before being uploaded to the film itself. The meticulous craft of Burtt and the entire sound team is an act of devotion and perfection that may go noticed by an inattentive viewer.Returning to my point made about WALL-E being the most thematically heavy film Pixar has ever made, such themes are technological advances, mass-consumerism, Christianity, love, corporation-takeover, and conformity. Consider the Buy N Large, the massive store in the sky that caters to an obese population of men and women that ride around in hovering seats, consuming food and drinks out of a cup, and wearing whatever the loudspeaker tells faithful shoppers what to where. The scene exploring the Buy N Large warehouse is a fascinating but poignant look at the effects of mass consumerism in America. It shows the kind of thing we'd like to believe we're immune to as humans but, unfortunately, are not and can be manipulated and directed in ways we never truly thought possible.The film was directed by Andrew Stanton, who largely led the team in creating Finding Nemo, one of Pixar's most renowned pictures for its emotionally touching story and beautiful animation. Finding Nemo featured some of the best animation, I believe, the CGI world has ever seen, and WALL-E's grittier, darker animation is not to be dismissed either. Stanton and the team of animators capture the vast landscapes of Earth and its desolate state, as well as space and its limited state. The animation is put to an incredible effect and Stanton proves to be worthy of operating with the animation company.WALL-E, too, shows a future where conformity is incredible. Everyone wears the same thing, possesses the same features, operates with little individualism, and function in the way where laziness appears to be something of an achievement. This is a frightening feature in a kids film; one that I don't see many young children picking up instantly. This isn't just the part of the film that keeps adults awake but keeps adults questioning the future we may be in for.Furthermore, the film works beautifully as a tone-piece and an amazingly made film in terms of grandiose animation and sound design. Ben Burtt's sound design and meticulous craft in pairing each obscure movement with a practical sound is easily the strongest thing in the film. Despite the lack of dialog, the film never fails to engage a viewer by showing them an unconventional love story that is made unpredictable because the way that Wall-E and EVE communicate is nonlinear and often ambiguous. These ingredients make WALL-E a truly stunning piece of animated art.Directed by: Andrew Stanton.","

"tieman64","9 April 2012","When Pixar's not sucking on the Disney Empire's sinister teat or filling landfills with discarded kitsch packaged in slow-to-biodegrade plastic and made by suicidal kids in China at environment destroying mega-factories...they're making eco-cautionary, anti corporatist films. In this regard we had the clean energy advocating ""Monster's Inc"" and ""Cars 2"", and the eco-loving, anti-consumerist, anti-corporate ""WALL-E"". Pixar's other films have a stranger tension, ""Cars"" decrying urban sprawl, gas guzzlers and life in the fast-lane by celebrating retro-cars, speedy races and old-school, ""good"", ""small town capitalism"", whilst the ""Toy Story"" movies yearn for the tactile, nostalgic pleasures of solid-state toys even as Pixar's dependence on pixels, processors and Pentiums pulverises whatever pull pre-digital entertainment ever had. Want to play with Mr Potato Head, honey? Screw that, Mom. Hit me some X-box. Now! Disney once performed a similar magic trick, making billions off public domain material whilst militantly copyrighting the same material (Disney lobbies were behind the drive to extend copyrights to a full century), aggressively suing everyone from the Academy Awards to daycare centres who dared place Snow Whites and Quasimodos in classrooms or playgrounds.Directed by Andrew Stanton, ""WALL-E"" revolves around a cute robot called WALL-E. He's (why do we assume WALL-E's male?) a cross between ET and ""Short Circuit's"" Johnny 5, with big robot eyes and a perpetually sad, puppy-dog look. When he's not mimicking old Chaplin, Keaton and Harold Lloyd routines, WALL-E's patrolling a now derelict planet Earth, stacking garbage, junk and dutifully doing his best to repair a polluted planet. Enter EVE, an apparently female robot who has been sent to Earth to scan for vegetation. While WALL-E resembles an old VHS system, EVE's a cross between a tampon and an Ipod, all sleek enamel, digital readouts and laser beams. The duo embark on an adventure which teaches us about the fragility and strengths of our ecosystem and condemns mega-corporations/branding/advertising/rampant-consumerism (shades of the sci-fi eco-parable ""Silent Running""), before launching into a second half which takes place upon the Axiom (literally, ""the worthy few""), a spaceship where fat, lazy humans are doted on by machines.The film's best moments occur in its first, Earth-bound quarter. Here our robots share a courtship that evokes Chaplin's ""Little Tramp"", ""Modern Times"", Virginia Cherrill's blind flower girl in ""City Lights"" and the love affair in Keaton's ""The General"". This section is also quite melancholic, WALL-E a lonely outcast thanklessly tasked with cleaning up humanity's mess. We feel for him. He's also a bit like Neville of Matheson's ""I am Legend"" (pet cockroach instead of dog), barricading himself in his bunker each night in an effort to escape sandstorms.Unfortunately the film quickly becomes Pixar's most saccharine, manipulative, contrived, obvious and heavy handed. Cheap death scenes are frequently rolled out to elicit tears (WALL-E keeps dying and his cockroach keeps getting squashed), WALL-E's big sad eyes are relentlessly milked, and the film's ""GARGANTUAN EMOTIONAL MOMENTS"" are mostly all forced and obvious. Throw in a generic ""red button"", ""ticking clock"", ""countdown to explosion"" finale, a series of second-rate action scenes (and obligatory ""poetic flying scenes""), last-minute villains (""2001's"" HAL meets ""Flight of the Navigator's"" Max), weak comedy, corny characters and you have one of Pixar's worst. The film also struggles to cook up interesting visuals and virtual sets, its aesthetics becoming conventional as soon as the film launches into outer space. Stanton's previous Pixar effort (""Finding Nemo"") kept its two sections – expansive ocean reefs and claustrophobic urban fish tanks – much more fresh. With ""WALL-E"" you've seen it all before.""WALL-E's"" message is all over the place, which upon release resulted in it being embraced by both American liberals (hug a tree!) and conservatives (pro free-market, anti big government). Regardless, the film has little real world bearing. Historically, machines increase work, obesity is linked to social class (ie, the poor, not the indolent) and in the real world consumerism/fatties are bolstered not by machines but skinny slave labour abroad. In this way ""WALL-E's"" a very white, middle class, American-centric film: it's an appeal to stop consuming and start recycling rather than a look into the reasons for and futility of both. Bizarrely, the film's ""anti-consumerism"" but fetishizes retro objects - silent films, Zippo lighters, plastic forks, hubcaps, Rubik's cubes, nuts, bolts and bits of treasure - treasure which WALL-E identifies as being representative of humanity. For WALL-E (cool: he's more a historian than garbage-bot), objects have souls, which is capitalist nostalgia axenic.Like most ""environmental films"", ""WALL'E's"" aching for a pure, untouched, unpolluted, pre-globalisation, pre-digital past. A return to the wilderness (see ""Survivors of the Dead""). And like these films (""Avatar"" etc), it wrongly turns ""environmentalism"" into a personal choice. But people are mostly frugal and it is systems, not people, which make society ""happen"". It is not your fault you're inundated with packaging, spam and products with short life-spans. Rather, capitalism as an ordering system hinges on waste, overproduction, expansion, over-accumulation, exponentially increasing consumption, and is designed such that most products go trashed and/or unsold (corporations destroy tonnes of merchandise to prevent sales on the black market and horde goods to manipulate demand/prices etc). It is the ""normal situation"" of bourgeois society for a great part of existing products and of the previously created productive forces, to be wasted. Much of this waste comes from an economic system which pits the same products against one another and requires copious labels and advertising as weaponry in this war. There can be no ""environmentalism"" or ""green movement"" unless one first radically re-figures our whole concept of production, wealth and ""money"" (wrongly, ""WALL-E"" is post money), ""money"" having long been exposed as a powerful political tool for expropriation, as opposed to a mere ""neutral medium of exchange"", as is commonly believed.7.5/10 – Almost as annoying as ""Avatar"".","

"happipuppi13","3 May 2022","Okay, to start, I can see there's enough reviews here to cover what the
movie is all about and I'm sure more than enough people have seen it.On seeing this myself , I can honestly say, ""Wall E"" is a very moving, touching, entertaining story. This movie's not only a feast for the eyes but an animated and well directed & acted example of emotional and compelling storytelling.I know by now, many are used to this form of animation and many stories told with it, can start to feel similar. I feel the story here though, is a very original one and quite serious in nature for a family film but , it's not so dark that it comes across as disturbing.While there are stretches of silence, where it replaces uneeded dialog, it did enhance the drama here and I liked that there wasn't a lot of dialog. The actions of WALL-E & EVE said it better than any lines that could have been written.It is quite a hefty storyline for young viewers to see a lone robot, in a devastated world, not only finding & feeling love but how that love helps in the salvation of the planet by his accidental flight to the space station where the human population now resides because of the devastation of the planet.The earth we see Wall-E in, is not just the ecological disaster area the world could become but also, should any survive and we actually go into space, generations later will never know about the kind of world we once lived in.The people being all overweight and lazy, is a metaphor for how little we seem to care right now about not only our planet but our own lives.That's why the ending is very important also. It honestly is up to the people of the world to do all possible to make sure this never happens.I liked the simpler animation used at the end, showing the earth being renewed while Peter Gabriel sings his great song ""Down To Earth"".The Oscar winning ""Wall-E"" will certainly be a
classic in animated films, if it isn't consideredd so alreadyTen Stars : E-asily! (END)","

"zetes","29 June 2008","I honestly want to throw every superlative I can think of at this movie. I'm an unabashed Pixar fan, and have been since Toy Story 2, but I was a little disappointed in their last two films, Cars and Ratatouille. Both were good, very good at times, but I don't think they hit the level of what came before. To me, WALL-E is a return to form. No, that's too weak. It's their peak. No, that's wrong, too. A ""peak"" implies that they're about to go down. I doubt that's true, although it's going to be hard to beat this one. WALL-E is my favorite of the Pixar films so far because I think it goes past the point of merely fantastic to that of being transcendent. It's a truly visionary film, one that inspired my jaw to drop over and over again. And it's intimate, too. It's hard to believe, but you're going to fall in love with a couple of robots when you watch the movie. And it's incredibly smart, too. Pixar has actually had this vein in most if not all of their movies, where they deliver moral lessons without any pandering whatsoever. The movie also contains deft social commentary. It's a pure joy to watch, and, without a doubt, one of the all-time great animated movies. Thank God for Pixar.","

"tankace","14 March 2016","Walle is a piece of art, I can't put it in other worlds apart of that, Pixar ,here, has created a new classic suited for our world ,who is based on scientific advancement, fears about the environment and how the future will be after wards.To add to that Walle is one of the cutest characters I have ever seen and his movie more than deserves the high rating it has. I remember very well when I went to cinema to see it with my school, is one of the few good memories I have from the years in junior high school. In summary, Walle is the cutest post-apocalyptic movie which has been made,is beautiful to watch and gives to the kids good lesson about the way we treat our planet, this blue dot in the sky to paraphrase Carl Seagan.","

"Groverdox","27 February 2023","I think I've failed ""WALL-E"". It seemed like there's a great movie in there somewhere. I just wasn't able to focus on it for long enough to detect it. I don't know why. The movie just barely held my attention. It's true that my attention span sucks. But if anything would be easy to focus on for its whole length, it'd be a movie from Pixar, the Disney of CGI animation.So what went wrong? I don't know. This was a re-watch: I thought I might get more out of ""WALL-E"" a second time. I was wrong.I understood the basic premise of the movie, ie. A lone robot tasked with cleaning up Earth falls in love with an extra-terrestrial robot sent to find signs of sustainability.After that, though, it lost me, and I just wasn't able to concentrate on it.","

"cosmorados","27 January 2009","As the film starts in space with a song from Hello Dolly, you wonder just quite what you're getting yourself into. A few moments later we are transported to Earth, up-to-it's eyeballs in garbage, however help is at hand, in the cuboid shape of WALL-E, a waste allocation load lifter, Earth-class. Once WALL-E was part of a huge herd of robotic trash compactors built to help the human race get out of the mess it had made, while they stayed in space, waiting for everything to be sorted. However, it's 700 years later and only one WALL-E is left and on his own he has become a tad eccentric. With only a cockroach as a friend he spends his time doing his job and trying to learn more about the people who once inhabited this little world. Of course if that was the entire film it wouldn't be very good and shortly after it starts WALL-E is joined by EVE, a far more advanced model whose mission is a secret.This is Pixar's most ambitious film to date. From the moment the title appears and the music really kicks in we feel this is different to the cutesy world of superheroes and talking cars and animals that have gone before. This is a film that has elements that are grim, unsettling and ask difficult questions about what we are doing as custodian's of the planet. The script and story are an absolute triumph as the skill's of the animator's to make those hundred's of pixels perform in such charming, heart-warming ways is a joy to watch.The pacing of the film, unlike Nemo, The Incredibles and Cars is flawless and you get the feeling that a lot was sacrificed to keep that running time as tight and precise as it is. There is not a frame wasted, nor one shot too many. However, the thing that gets me most about this film, no matter how many times I watch this film I see something new that I haven't seen before. The lighting looks like a real film, the pauses and reactions from the robot performers are exquisite with more than a nod being shown to the silent pioneers at the turn of the last century who started this thing called cinema off. After watching this I think they'd be proud to see how far their medium has come.There's a saying that you can't polish a turd, and sadly in the media these days hundreds of millions of dollars are spent polishing so many expensive summer turds (Dark Knight anyone?) This was a joy to watch and discover that in spite of the stupidity of this business of show, there are still worlds full of sparkle, Barnaby! A Masterpiece of the medium.Nuff said.","

"insomniac_rod","29 December 2009","WALL-E is more than an animated feature film. It's a lesson in all aspects for any film fanatic.This movie delivered expectations. It delivers a message towards humanity, how we should respect nature and life overall. But it also has to do with loyalty, kindness, love, friendship and more values that aren't explored in modern cinema.The visuals are breath taking. To be honest, after 15 minutes of it's running time, I felt it was a cold film only based on spectacular animation and a CGI world. But I was very wrong. Soon after WALL-E finds Eva things get better in all aspects. The movie turns out to be a fantastical experience in terms of positivity, delivering a human and social message and it entertains us.Heck, it even makes us feel sad and powerful (all about WALL-E getting whacked and then recovering).This is by far one of the best movies of the decade. It teaches and makes you feel.","

"DonFishies","28 June 2008","I did not quite know what to make of WALL-E when I first saw the previews for it. It did not look like a typical animated film at all, and seemed like a huge undertaking, even for as big a giant as Pixar is in the realm of animation. But imagination and originality is something Pixar has always been known for (as well as making great movies aimed at all ages), and this film is no exception.WALL-E tells the story of a robot who seems to be one of the last inhabitants living on Earth. He spends his days collecting immense amounts of trash, and then compacts it into smaller squares of garbage that he ends up building into large structures. He collects specific items that he categorizes in his pseudo-trailer home, and watches Hello Dolly! at night, hoping for some sort of interaction with something other than a cockroach. And as anyone can predict, his prayers are answered in the form of the female robot EVE who lands on Earth to carry out a classified mission. And getting to know her is only the start of this robot's adventure.I had my doubts, but Pixar have really outdone themselves with this one.Without a shadow of a doubt in my mind, WALL-E is one of the most original pieces of cinema I have ever encountered. While not necessarily a silent film, the film features very little talking, and mainly features characters who speak to each other through machine noises and the use of their name (and WALL-E and EVE are not the only two kinds of robots featured in the film). But one would be hard-set to notice the lack of dialogue because of how enthralling the film is. From the mere first glance at WALL-E, the film draws the audience into this little robot's role in life, and his inevitable adventure. This could have easily been made into a gimmicky film, but Pixar never lets it stray too far from the epic scope it set out for the film from the opening shot onwards.The story, without ruining it, is very simplistic. But not in a way that will make people easily write it off. Rather, it is simplistic in how very uncomplicated it is. The characters of WALL-E and EVE can only show so much depth, and for that reason, there is not a whole lot to their story. Yes, there are some genuinely moving scenes I thought impossible to see coming from CGI-animated robots, but this film manages to make a whole group of robots emote in all kinds of ways. There is a bit of social satire thrown in for good measure as well, which helps deepen the spiritual conscience of the film, and helps flesh out a few of the key points WALL-E's chosen career and lifestyle seem to nod at. But as said, the film never gets too ahead of itself, and never once bites off more than it can chew. It knows what it wants to accomplish, and it manages to do it very easily.But with it being a Pixar film, there is a certain assumption that the animation will be pristine and nearly perfect. WALL-E, although released a mere year after the visually stunning Ratatouille, could be the best any of their films have ever looked. The vast landscapes (both on Earth and through space), diverse range of characters and the breathtaking amount of action taking on place are all nearly jaw dropping. Watching the scene with WALL-E flying through space is a marvel all on its own, if only for the brilliant usage of so many colours. The animation is so detailed that you can see the ingrained dirt and patches of rust that cover WALL-E's body. Pixar just keeps upping their ante in how marvellous their animation is, and I can only imagine it is going to get better as the years go on.What truly sets this film apart from others, is that it does not try to be different. It feels just like any other Pixar film, and despite the lack of dialogue, is just as funny and charming as the rest of them. Somehow, director/writer Andrew Stanton has realized that the simplicity of the film can only help build up its charm and real world wit. The film is crafted in a way that makes it nearly impossible not to fall in love with and hang on every moment that passes. WALL-E wants to be seen on the same level as other animated flicks, and it looks like the filmmakers spent an immense amount of time making the film accessible to anyone, dialogue plagued or not.The film is not perfect however. The ending seems a little forced, and a touch silly (especially based on what the audience learns over the course of the film up to that point), but the genuine sense of adventure is enough to not make a big deal out of it. As well, even though the movie practically flies through its running time, there is still a bit of dull weight in certain scenes. They accomplish what they are set out to do, but there was more than a few instances where specific scenes could have been cut, and the film would have turned out the same way.But even through its imperfections, the film sucks you into its naive and adorable world where our hero is a robot who makes robot noises and says his own name a lot. It speaks absolute volumes that this film can be made and not make anyone at Pixar or Disney break a sweat. WALL-E is one of the most original and heartfelt films of this or any other year, and skipping it would be a disservice to the animation genre. It is one hell of a cute and funny movie, and easily one of the year's best.9/10.","

"MaxBorg89","31 December 2008","That Pixar manages to stay at the top in the animation field no matter what is a well known fact. That it improves on its own standards with each new movie is also common knowledge, as well as a bit of a miracle. Still, after a creativity peak like the magnificent Ratatouille, their best movie to this day, what could they possibly do to top that? They came up with their boldest picture ever, a philosophical ""kids' movie"" that doesn't quite beat Ratatouille, but still stands out as the grand animated achievement of 2008.With WALL-E, the Pixar guys have made their first science-fiction: the setting is Earth, several centuries from now. The planet has been deemed impossible to live on, and so all of mankind is on an intergalactic cruise where everyone, including the ship's captain (Jeff Garlin) gets to relax all day long. Yeah, okay, but what about good old Earth? Well, an emergency plan was set in motion, with thousands of robots left to clean up our mess. Too bad that after all these years none of those machines actually work anymore. Only one keeps operating: Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class, aka WALL-E (""voice"" provided by renowned sound designer Ben Burtt), a cute little thing that keeps piling up garbage and organizing it in neat little cubes.WALL-E isn't just good at his job, he's also incredibly curious, which is why he occasionally keeps ""weird"" objects he finds while on duty (bras, batteries, etc) and stores them in his home, where he spends his days watching Hello, Dolly! and pining after some company. It isn't hard to imagine, then, how happy he gets when another robot, Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, or EVE (Elissa Knight), lands on the planet. Though initially unresponsive to WALL-E's attentions (she is there on a mission, after all), EVE eventually bonds with the little robot (frankly, what else can you do?) and takes him with her on a journey unlike anything else he's ever experienced.Why is this Pixar's boldest movie? Well, for starters, the first real line of dialogue isn't spoken until 40 minutes into the film, a fact most children might not be fully prepared to embrace. Fortunately, writer/director Andrew Stanton, who gave us the wonderful Finding Nemo, knows exactly how to win everyone over: for one thing, he's got the best Pixar character ever as the lead; for another, those first 40 minutes, which rely more on sound and sight than actual plot, are easily the most beautiful thing ever done in an American animated feature. Such is the breathtaking seductiveness of the future imagined by Stanton and his creative partners.Then there's the blatant ecological subtext: it couldn't have a greener message if Al Gore showed up for a cameo (he already did that in Futurama). That too could be too much for a younger viewer, so how do the filmmakers get around it? Why, the Pixar way, of course: smart writing, great humor, heartfelt romance (bit of a paradox, given we're talking about two robots, but who cares?), clever in-jokes (Sigourney Weaver voicing a computer) and the indispensable John Ratzenberger on vocal duties (this time, he plays a character named... John), all together for a ride few people will be able to forget.WALL-E is part of that rare breed of movie that's unlike anything that's come before it, yet strangely familiar. It's intelligent but not preachy, brave but not extremely so, moving but not schmaltzy. Translation: a must-see sample of cinematic magic, 100% Pixar.","

"bob the moo","15 September 2008","It took me a minute to get round to seeing this film, mainly due to letting the kids clear out of the cinema and the hype / pester power effect on the audience demographic settle down some. Finally getting to see it for myself I was pleased to find that it is the probably the most accomplished Pixar film since, well, since the last one. Of course the most obvious way that things has stepped up yet again is technically as the film is beautifully animated with even convincing dust hanging in the atmosphere and even the humans ""real"" (well, real in the context of the Pixar universe anyway). The level of detail is not only technically impressive but also impressive in the imagination and creativity in making this world and characters. However its in the characters where the film is most impressive. Without a great deal of dialogue to speak of it is amazing that the film manages to create characters that are not only cute and funny but also that the audience care about and for, and this is what the film achieves, making Wall-E an ET for this generation. The plot operates on two levels and the characters are most important for the simple, very human, love story between Wall-E and Eve. This thread is charmingly delivered throughout and it is hard not to feel for Wall-E as he seeks out the simple feelings and gestures that he has watched nightly for hundreds of years.Operating above this is a plot that owes a debt to Silent Running in the same way as Wall-E himself owes something to Huey and Dewey. With a heavier hand at the wheel, this would have been a very preachy and obvious eco-message but with Stanton it is actually pretty smart and manages to reach children without being clumsy and obvious for adults. Actually this also applies to the humour as well because there is not so much of a duality where aspects of the film are divided  so the character falling over is for kids but the one-liner that follows is for adults; instead Wall-E pretty much pitches everything to the benefit of the film and story. OK so we still get the references but they are not put in so much as woven in  hard to explain perhaps but if you watch this versus, for example, Shrek, you'll see what I mean  Wall-E is not some pop-culture reference-driven film that will be old in a few years once people forget who the celebs were that year. This strengths the film further by just feeling like an all-round engaging and enjoyable film  OK the level or depth that you watch it to will vary between adults and children, but it is this that is different  not WHAT they are watching so much as how.The ""cast"" of the film are really the animators because, aside from a nice touch of casting in Weaver, the majority of work is done by them. As such Wall-E and Eve are very expressive considering what they are. It is all in tiny movements on the ""faces"" and in the body language  actors struggle to always do it without dialogue so how much harder is it to get it right when you are creating it on a computer? The answer I guess would be ""much harder"" which is why it is so impressive that with barely a word spoken we manage to care so much for these robots.Wall-E will almost certainly win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature but, for probably the first time, Pixar have a film that genuinely deserves consideration for Best Feature  it is that engaging, well crafted and charming and manages to do that for all sections of the audience without resorting to the oft-used (and mostly fun) ""one for me, one for you"" style of some of these films.","

"Bumblebee_Man","20 July 2008","When it comes to animated films, Pixar are masters of the craft. Ever since their feature film debut, the magnificent 'Toy Story', the animation studio have brought us such instant classics as 'Monsters Inc.', 'The Incredibles' and 'Finding Nemo', a film which remains as one of the biggest selling DVDs of all time. Surely it's about time that they delivered us a bad film? Well, sorry to disappoint, but Pixar's 'WALL-E' is among not only their greatest work, but among the greatest animations ever produced.The film opens with some astonishing shots of a desolate, rubbish-laden, polluted Earth; a boldly dark opening for a family oriented feature. It is amidst these dystopian surroundings, however, that our hero - arguably more adorable than a basket full of puppies and kittens - is first introduced to us. WALL-E is a character of genius; combining elements of Johnny 5, Charlie Chaplin and Mr. Bean, Andrew Stanton (Director) and crew have created something that will no doubt go down in history with R2-D2 as one as the screen's most memorable machines.It is the 22nd Century, and mankind have left Earth in giant Space Cruisers waiting for the surface of their planet to finally become habitable again. 700 years have past, and WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), is the last of a group of robots left to clean up the planet. In a disturbing sequence, our hero ventures home through trash heaps laden with 'dead' WALL-E's... another sign that this is not the usually Pixar fare, but something more meaningful, more bold, more... adult in theme. And this is what the first act of the film is. WALL-E, accompanied by his pet cockroach (who, as a testament to Pixar's genius, we grow to care for just as much as the metal man himself), goes about his daily routine. It is in this mostly silent section of the film that we grow to love WALL-E. As he rumages through human garbage, finding interest in things that seem mundane to us, we discover that after all these years, this little robot has developed something that makes him seem more to us than an animated clunk of cogs and rust... a personality. His incredibly curious nature make for some of the most adorable moments depicted in film (including moments such as WALL-E meets car keys and WALL-E meets... bra). We delve further into this intriguing personality when we invited into the little guy's 'house', a storage space for all his collected junk. Whilst WALL-E watches a VCR of the musical 'Hello, Dolly!"", we see from his large, emotional eyes and clasping hands that he is, heartbreakingly, all alone on this immense world.Then, the following day, as WALL-E goes about his trash-cube-making business, something extraordinary, both to us and WALL-E, occurs. A space ship touches down on the surface, holding within it EVE, a futuristic, Ipod-resembling droid here to scout the earth for plant-life... and WALL-E's one true love (aww).This love story eventually leaps from Earth into space and onto The Axiom, an immense Space Ship on which a large number of the American population - depicted as lazy, obese, consumerist slobs - go about the same mundane routine day in, day out. Message heavy, but never preachy. In the end, through WALL-E, everyone learns the true meanings of life: Love and the relationships with those around us. Oh, and to take care of the planet, of course.Beautiful visuals, astonishing characterisation and a sequence with WALL-E and EVE floating through space that is more romantic than anything your likely to see this year, make 'WALL-E' an outstanding achievement that proudly stands among Pixar's finest work. WALL-E is a completely realised character, and one which I am sure we have not seen the last of. Although, some would argue, not as accessible as other films in the genre (some children may grow resteless during the film's earlier, dialogue-free sequences), 'WALL-E' will leave a lasting impression on cinema goers of all ages.And that is the genius of Pixar. The only studio ever to create films that are, truly, 'for all the family'. -Dan Henry, 20th July 2008","

"Sirus_the_Virus","24 August 2009","Wall E is one of the best of Pixar's works. Not only that, it's one of the best animations to date. I personally don't like it as much as Ratatouille, but that's just me. Wall E is cute, romantic, and beautiful. It's also sweet. Pixar animation beats Dreamworks in every way imaginable. Most Dreamworks films are good. in 2008, we had the overrated Kung Fu Panda and Wall E.Wall E takes place in the future. Wall E is the last living thing on earth. Ben Burtt does the voice of Wall E, a lonely robot who needs company. Then another robot arrives on Earth. Wall E falls in love with a robot named Eve. Who at first tries to kill him. Wall E and Eve become inseparable. Wall E is finally happy. When Wall E gives EVE a plant, Eve goes into lockdown mode and doesn't speak or move her arms. Then one day, a spaceship comes and picks her up. Wall E jumps on the ship to save his love. The space ship travels to another large space ship. People live inside the space ship. The people there are fat and absolutely lazy. The thing about them is that they are kind of cute. The weird thing at least. I'm not going to say anything else about the film or it's plot.Pixar has won yet again. I hope Up will be as good as Ratatouille, Wall E, and Finding Nemo. The relationship between Wall E and EVE is cute. The movie is just plain cute. If you didn't see this, then I advise that you do. I guarantee parents didn't want to watch this. I didn't want to watch this. But I bet the ones who did were pleasantly surprised. I didn't think I was going to like it, but I actually loved it.","

"desire_911","10 August 2008","Pixar and Disney have done it again! This is an historic piece of film-making and an example of what can happen when a studio like Pixar continually refuses to compromise making the best film possible....every time...and we're talking nine times now in a row!!! This movie works as kid's movie, a science fiction film, a romantic comedy, and for much of it...a silent film. It had a great message but was not preachy. It had stunning visuals throughout. My expectations were so high for this film...and yet they were far exceeded by the geniuses at Pixar...I don't know how they do it. This movie makes up for the disappointment I felt after seeing the latest Indiana Jones installment. Spielberg and Lucas, I have a ""directive"" for you. Take your kids to see WALL-E immediately, and definitely take notepad!!!Overall Score: 9.2/10","

"vip_ebriega","16 December 2008","My Take: One of the very best films of the year. An instant classic. The late TV film critic Gene Siskel once said that you can say a lot about a certain character through looking at their eyes. Well, Mr. Siskel would have loved WALL-E, Pixar's latest creation whose head is all binocular-like eyes. Yet they elicit enough emotions to make him almost human. When he's either happy, sad, serious or whatever else, this cute little robot just moves his eyes a bit and leaves the cinematic magic to his creators to give him more emotions than the Tin Man. But enough solely talking about this films lead character, almost everything about WALL-E sums up one of the best films of the year (if only I had seen it on theaters earlier to complete the experience!).WALL-E didn't just charm me, it moved me in mysterious ways. It's beautifully done, crisply animated, yet it's also charming, topical, breezy and breathtakingly soaring. The storyline is beyond anything I've seen in years (try R2-D2 in a holiday-off from STAR WARS to give you an idea about what WALL-E is about). But beyond that, there's something else really special about WALL-E. Because, sometime throughout the film, I started to see myself in the character. Few films are capable of making you see yourself in the character, and just for the films first hour, WALL-E is already movie magic.The first hour of the film is definitely the best, which looks and feels like a silent comedy, introducing us to the film's adorable little robot of the title. ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth-class"" aka Wall-E (voiced with various beeps and hums courtesy of Ben Burtt), the earth's last-functional stuck to his duties to clean up the world's waste while everyone on earth has already evacuated. But after years (better add a few more zeros to a million years) of cleaning up, Wall-E has developed a certain something: curiosity and personality. With no one on earth to keep him company, he takes pleasure in everyday objects like old cassette tapes, a Rubik's cube, a light bulb and a little cockroach who keeps him company. But he's prayers are answered (if robots can pray!) when a ship drops a little probot called EVE, whom he immediately falls in love with... even with those laser weapons at hand. But when EVE is carried away back from her source, the love-struck Wall-E tags along and ends up fighting to resurrect and recolonize earth.The first half, clearly the best part in this movie is a marvelous display of creativity, while the second half is filled with excitement and startling little revelations, and that moving love story between Wall-E and EVE. But the sum of both parts creates the finest animated adventure in a long time. Now sign yourself and your family up for a cruise with WALL-E and have an intergalactic adventure unlike anything in this or any galaxy!Rating: ***** out of 5.","

"Grojniar","30 July 2021","This was a masterpiece down to the smallest detail. Getting to see Wall-E and Eva go through so much so fast and seeing their different personalities kind of go through every emotion was very lovable. Seeing Eva notice Wall-Es feelings while watching her security feed then seeing her realize her own feelings for Wall-E was very heartwarming. Honestly I never thought I'd tear up for romance between two robots but this was one of the best romances in a family movie that I have her seen. Everything in the movie fit together perfectly from the visuals to the soundtrack. As I've said before I have nothing but respect for movies that share an important message, it just annoys me when the messages is completely ignored.","

"joncheskin","25 February 2015","It is very rare that I award a movie a 10 out of 10 on one of these reviews, but WALL-E fits the bill for that rating for sure. To earn the rating, you have to do something completely brilliant, something that really has not been done before. WALL-E does just that.The secret is the characters, and actually the trajectory of the artistic idea starts with the film to which WALL-E is most indebted, 2001: A Space Odyssey. In that movie, Stanley Kubrick decided it was time for a computer to be a real movie villain. The computer becomes a character, and actually turns malevolent. The idea touched a nerve that spawned an incredible number of spin-offs, most notably the Terminator movies, in which the idea is inverted (after the first movie), and the computer (machine) actually becomes a hero.In WALL-E, what happens is we get the first love story between two pieces of technology, and the question is seriously raised about the meaning of love and humanity. The possibility of full-bodied in-love droids that actually strive to save humanity make a very clever point that technology is not necessarily evil, it only becomes evil with careless use or lack of control. The love story is incredibly touching because it occurs between objects that are the product of human creation. The whole idea is really original.Add to this all of standard technical brilliance that we know of Pixar--awesome animation, music, etc., and WALL-E simply outdoes anything that Disney has done recently. It is rare to encounter a movie that is simply mind-boggling because of its originality.","

"Scars_Remain","17 July 2008","Not only do I find this to be one of the best films of all time, not only do I believe that it's the greatest Disney/Pixar film ever made, but I think it's a candidate for the best animated film in the history of movies. Everything about this film is sheer brilliance. I saw it this morning and I am still blown away by it. Everyone needs to see this movie, there are no exceptions! The story is probably the most amazing part of the film. The makers successfully created a very intriguing and intelligent story that has no dialog at all for the first half of the movie. The characters are extremely well thought out and very accessible and likable.Let's get to the animation, shall we? This is, hands down, the best animation I have ever seen on film to date, and I've seen a lot of movies. The visuals are absolutely stunning and every tiny little detail is thought out and shown. I couldn't believe my eyes.This is a movie that has to be seen in theaters first. Do yourself a favor and go see it right away. It is film making at its finest!","

"Mightyzebra","2 August 2008","I was sure this film would be good, but there were a few surprises...1. I did not realize that the love between Wall.E and Eve would be so strong.2. I did not realize how much the humans in this film have changed from the ones now.3. I did not realize that there would be some sudden points in this film and some scary points in the film.4. I did not realize there would be a baddie.These surprises did not totally distract me from the best parts of the film, which are the very beginning and when Wall.E and Eve are in love. They are two robots, Wall.E has been on earth for 700 years, cleaning up earth which is covered in rubbish. Every day Wall.E puts the rubbish into bricks and builds towers of it. Anything that he finds interesting, he takes it back to his little ""house"". In the first fifteen minutes or so of the film, Wall.E meets a little cockroach, one of the first living creatures he has seen, then he finds a plant, which he has never seen before. He takes this into his house. Later, a robot named Eve, from space, where every human now lives, comes down to earth to search for signs of life. Wall.E falls in love with her and after some misunderstanding between them, Wall.E manages to show Eve his little house, some of his things and the plant. Eve is programmed to now be taken back to space, to show this plant to the humans, so that they can return to earth. Wall.E is so lonely on earth, that he decides to come with her...I love this film because of the beautiful Pixar graphics, Wall.E, Eve and the way they love each other. The environmental message shown in this film is very good and if everyone who watches this film pays attention to that message, the world could start becoming a better place. Unfortunately, I have a feeling people are not understanding this message and so, are still not taking action.I recommend this film to anyone who likes Pixar graphics, who do not mind films that are a little bit slow and like Wall.E! Enjoy ""Wall.E""!! :-) :-)","

"Alise_shenle","4 September 2008","Wall E is the most excellent, thought provoking film there is since SpiderMan's (with great power comes great responsibility). It gives us the haunting truth about the 'utopia' life we'll have, if we don't do something NOW to conserve this wonderful planet, to stop pollution. Using actions instead of words, Wall E continues to do his duty though he is the only one left. He is also very humane, caring for the cockroach, and very friendly towards Eve, though she tried to kill him many times at first. He would also sacrifice himself for Earth, and he nearly died. Wall E might tremble at the sight of a spaceship, but he is incredibly brave in rescuing Eve and the shoot. The scene with the couple singing and holding hands really strikes a chord into our hearts. He might be outdated as a robot, but he would do anything to save Earth. Eve was at first a cold robot, but after Wall E touches her, she became more interesting, especially when she thought Wall E had forgotten her, she looked so crushed. She was also cool as a flying supergirlfriend. Also, though she likes to laser many things, she is nice to the cockroach too. The captain is a nice guy, he is willing to do what many generations ahead of him had opted for the easy way, face the damage of earth and do his best, because THIS IS OUR HOME!! He'd rather do the right thing than the easy thing. GO! The idea of humans becoming lazy and dependent on robots is frightening. We would only care about ourselves and dump Earth. Maybe dump the spaceship too if it's got too much trash. I hope we will not end up like this!! Can't even stand, or turn over, relying on a robot and chair. Wall E is great! DON'T MISS THE BEST MOVIE THERE EVER WAS!","

"TheUnseenMovieLover","20 July 2008","Though there have been some exceptional movies so far this year (Iron Man, Forgetting Sarah Marshall etc), there have been few which I would call a classic. With WALL-E, things have just changed. WALL-E isn't only the best film of 2008 so far (I might eat those words when The Dark Knight comes out in a few days), it is also a pure masterpiece. From start to finish, the film wraps you in utterly delightful charm and humanity. WALL-E is a piece of inventive beauty and wonder unlike any other that you will see at the cinema this summer. I absolutely guarantee it.WALL-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is the last operating robot on Earth. As for the human race, they left 700 years ago, when the huge amounts of self-produced trash caught up with them. WALL-E's task is to clean up the planet for the return of the humans. However, after being left on his own for so long, WALL-E has developed a personality. He is curious about many of the items that he finds whilst compacting trash, such as an old tape of the musical ""Hello Dolly!"" But he is also becoming lonely, which is understandable for someone who only has a friendly cockroach for company.However, all of this changes with the arrival of EVE (voiced by Elissa Knight). Thought EVE is initially hostile towards WALL-E, this doesn't stop him from becoming smitten with her and trying to connect with her. However, EVE has come to Earth on a classified mission. Once that mission has been completed, EVE shuts down and waits to be taken back from whence she came. When her transport arrives, WALL-E can't bear to lose his friend and sneaks aboard. His search for EVE brings him into contact with the remainder of the human race, who have been taking refuge on a huge spaceship and who have become excessively reliable on machines to supply their every need. They don't even walk. However, WALL-E's arrival sets many events in motion which may help the human race to return to normality...First of all, WALL-E's animation is flawless. However, as with the rest of the film, there is also a sense of risk and bravery which adds extra dimensions to the glorious animation. The first moments in the film, which show us the beauty of the stars before swooping down to gaze upon a barren and deserted Earth, are so detailed and emotionally engaging that you are immediately sucked into the tale without any hesitation. Even when the story becomes more traditional (that is in no way an attack on the film), the creativity and power of the film's visuals never falter.The main focus of the plot is on the growing affection between WALL-E and EVE. This is one of the most moving romantic relationships in years. No, they're not even human. But watching the initial conflict of EVE's determination and WALL-E's innocence slowly mix into love and companionship is magnificent. The scenes between the two characters on Earth are simply wonderful, perfectly paced and confident in the set-up of this unusual couple. However, the best scene comes in the second half, when WALL-E and EVE dance through space together. Everything in this scene is perfect, the comedy of watching WALL-E propel himself through space by use of a fire extinguisher, the lovely visuals, Thomas Newman's marvellous score and the interaction between the two characters. When WALL-E looks likely to float off into space after the fire extinguisher runs out, EVE flies in and scoops him up in her arms. This scene is pure cinematic genius. Overall, there is a humanity and grace of execution in the relationship between WALL-E and EVE which elevates it far beyond the emotional impact of other romantic relationships. The term of ""cinematic genius"" can also be applied to the iconic character of WALL-E and the fantastic direction by Finding Nemo director Andrew Staunton. Staunton shows that he is willing to inject some risk into his movie-making if it makes a better film. This decision pays off magnificently here. Staunton has lovingly constructed this film with invention, depth and bravura, and in doing so has crafted a piece of movie making which is likely to go down as at least a family classic. Not only will children be enthralled by the sheer brilliance of this film, but other audiences will also be open to its bewitching magic. As for WALL-E himself, he is one of the most original movie creations in years. Speaking in sequences of robotic speech (bleeps, whirs etc) with only small moments of mechanical dialogue, the filmmakers have still managed to create one of the most human characters of the year. By mostly using his eyes, the animators are able to flawlessly display WALL-E's emotions. In one scene, his eyes droop with sadness when EVE calls him Wally. When he panics or is happy, his eyes rise in an outburst of emotion. The life that the filmmakers are able to find in such simple mannerisms is incredible. Even the beeps and whirs, provided masterfully by legendary sound designer Ben Burtt, increase an already rich and lovable character to terrific heights. The character of WALL-E is just superb, as is the rest of the movie.WALL-E has just raised the bar for future animated movies. Pixar Animation Studios has already crafted many animated classics. WALL-E joins them without question. The visuals are compelling, the characters are endlessly endearing and the story is told with beauty, wit, imagination and humanity. I couldn't have asked for more.","

"aharmas","27 June 2008","It is ironic that the portrayal of a lonely mechanical being is the best reminder of what is best in all of us, of the divine spark that makes us special, able to create, not destroy, of keeping our hopes and spirits alive. ""Wall-E"" charmingly presents the idea without preaching, and its warnings are presented with no distractions, the consequences of our present lack of respect for ourselves and our world is shown in sad, broad strokes. ""Wall-E"" is part of the landscape, but he stands out because his spirit is able to break through and recognize that something is amiss, and that his ""heart"" beats strong waiting for the right moment to set things back in the proper order, even when that might not be his true intention. However, something has changed him the robot with the ability to feel and love. It is up to us to learn the lesson by watching his sweet odyssey.At first, Wall-E leaves in a desolate universe, a place that was once wonderful and strong. His program keeps him performing a routine that keeps him going; along the way he picks up and discovers thousands of little treasures that he saves in his ""home"". Eventually, his routine is shattered with the arrival of a stunning new presence. She literally and metaphorically storms into his world, and he is not the same anymore.Amazingly, it is the introduction of the setting that breaks our hearts, and it is the marvelous depiction of the courtship between EVE an Wall-E that restores our faith in the power of the ""human spirit"" because even though the mechanical wonders created through the process CGI, there is something sublime and divine in the mix, and it comes through in the portrayal of two beings that are representations/versions of what we can and might be if we get to believe in our own potential. As I mentioned before, there is a message here, subtly presented, unspoken but powerful enough to move worlds and travel through galaxies, to hit us with its universal power. This is an important movie, and it we really pay attention to its wonderful story, we can get far.How did it get so good? It is put together with several references to the best of many of the best films that have ever come out. It combines the forces of creative talent and the inspiration or the forces that are unleashed when a great film comes. The vision of ""2001"" with the heart of ""E.T."" finally explodes through the eyes of a simple, everyday robot that still has faith and believes in wonder. Even through the moments when the film becomes a ""thriller"", Wall-E as a character retains his innocence and never transforms itself into an empty headed display of fancy CGI work. In fact, he remains, a rather unsophisticated looking collection of mechanical pieces that has done well this far, and needs only more thing in his existence to be complete. When EVE arrives, we know she will be the perfect complement, and in the most exciting parts of the movie, EVE (wonder about the symbolism here), with her actions, allows humanity to pull through.""Wall-E"" is breathtaking, funny, sad, always engaging, and a masterpiece in every sense of the word, a work of love, consistent, accessible, beautiful to look, sweet in its depiction of a situation that is of utmost importance to everyone who lives in this world. Its message is clear, and it is not anyone's personal agenda or a direct attack on anyone. It is just a call to look back at what makes us the best we can be, to our ability to pull through in the worst of times, to that special feeling that we can't understand, but that we all yearn for, the ability to love ourselves, as well as the rest of what is around us.Typically a classic earns five stars; this time I wish this film could earn more, let's make it five gold stars...","

"iKramerica-1","13 July 2008","I love animation. I love Pixar. I love the character of Wall-E, and enjoyed the relationship with EVE. Is the animation amazing looking? Sure. Not as great as last years wonderful little rat movie or even as enthralling as Finding Nemo, but still an achievement and better than what most other studios can even dream of.But There was about 15 minutes of story here. Maybe 20. Much like a silent film of the past which doesn't hold up to today's standards, Wall-E just wears thin after a while. Yawning was contagious in parts, as was seat squirming. I've only experienced that once before at a Pixar film, Cars. Which also had a very shallow story, BTW.Wall-E felt longer than it was, never a good sign for a film. That they can carry a film that long with almost no dialog is amazing, but the pacing could have been stronger. But frankly, what you watch is a very compelling character basically run around in a video game environment. It's as if the whole movie was created just so it could be put onto an Xbox. ""This is the garbage collections stage."" ""Now that you cleared that, here's an interstitial story element."" ""Now this is the run away from EVE stage."" ""Now the run away from the guard robot stage."" ""Now the run away from cleaner robot stage."" ""More guard robots, different floor"" Etc. And watching someone play a video game is just not that exciting. How many chase scenes does one movie need? If you thought the end of Monsters Inc. was overly long due to the drawn out chase, you ain't seen nothing until you sit through the 40 minutes of chases in Wall-E.A technically distracting problem was the mixing of LIVE ACTION footage of Fred Willard and Hello Dolly with animated humans. It made no sense from a visual standpoint, and I really don't know what Lasseter was thinking here letting this idea get into the final film. Why Fred Willard wasn't animated like everyone else is just beyond comprehension.Another major problem with the movie is that Wall-E doesn't matter much to the story. He is not concerned with getting from A-B, which is kind of important. Without giving too much away, Wall-E is only interested in making EVE his girlfriend, which means that the ""mission"" that he is put on is not important to him. Which means he has no stake in the outcome. He doesn't care if it succeeds or fails other than it would please the girl robot, and even then, she doesn't really care either. And the resolution is full of deus ex machina moments. All of which reinforce the video game feel of the movie, where it's about clearing levels and completing tasks rather than a uniquely compelling story.In addition to the lack of a layered story and main character who has any stake, the environmental message was heavy handed and logically flawed to the point of being laughable. Goes far beyond the most outspoken doom and gloom propaganda you've ever heard. And it's not an ironic extreme, it's just a stupid one. The opening of the film was annoying in it's stupidity, no matter how well crafted it was. (The wall-mart bashing was similarly stupid, but at least that was more ironic.) But in terms of the trash and the air, humans could not have survived on the earth they left long enough to create the technology to leave it if it was in that condition. And no matter what some would like you to believe, it would be impossible to reach that state in less than 100 years. Not to mention that if humans create a giant biosphere to live in until they fix the earth, why do they fly off into a far off solar system it it? There is no need. Just create it ON earth. Self-contained is self- contained. And this shouldn't matter at all except it is a film aimed at children (and simple minded adults) with the goal of indoctrinating them into an extremist way of looking at the world, and specifically the USA (the world was deserted, but there was no mention of any city or country other than the USA). And I truly believe that the reason so many critics liked this film so much was this last point. It was anti-USA, anti-business, and environmentally alarmist, and fits perfectly with the Hollywood and media agenda of the last 15 years. I really respected Pixar for not falling into the ""message film"" trap, but I guess that combining Pixar management with Disney brought some of that influence into the fold, which is a bad thing for all of us.","

"tburke85","20 June 2009","Wall E was a much better than expected pixar movie writer/director Andrew Stanton who has done a great job in making this movie about a lonely robot left on Earth to clean up the waste left by humans in the distant future. The cast of relatively unknowns proving their voices for the character except for Sigourney Weaver are excellent. At the heart of this film is a love story between Wall-E and a more advanced robot named Eve. The writers did a great job of fleshing out the character of Wall-E whose in it for the majority of the movie. You care about the lonely robot because all he wants more than anything is a friend. This movie has a little something in it for everyone humor, some action, drama, character development, and a touching love story. I was very impressed with this film and I can see why after seeing Wall-E why may critics and audiences mostly kids really liked this one. The film was a little slow in the beginning but the rest made up for it's one flaw. Overall Wall-E has humor, some action, great special effects, romance, and well developed characters you come to care about. So if you're looking for a good movie to watch with your kids. You can go wrong with this one. Much better than expected.","

"OutsideHollywoodLand","2 February 2010","Wall-E is a tender tale of a hardworking robot named Wall-E, named for the company that created him. He works with a single-minded purpose every day, sorting through a virtual city of trash, most of which he dutifully compacts and piles into neat stacks that resemble buildings. Some of the junk he chooses to save, with the thought that it might someday be useful: A light bulb, hubcap, Rubik cube – they all becomes a part of his home, decorated with strings of bright holiday lights. At the end of a long and monotonous day, our hero replays a scene from the 1969 movie, ""Hello Dolly"", enthralled by Michael Crawford and Marianne McAndrew, holding hands and singing a tender love song. One day Wall-E and his cockroach sidekick Hal, witness a spaceship depositing a sleek little hover craft, designed to collect data and soil samples from the surrounding environment. Wall-E clings for dear life, hitching a ride on the spaceship that snatches up Eva after she collects a sample of plant life. Eva's life consists of living in a vast space center, where the human population is virtually waited on hand and foot. My daughter's snoring interrupted my amazement at a new plot twist. What began as a sweet love story between two robots was now a cautionary tale of an entire population of couch potatoes, forced to abandon Earth when the trash makes the surface uninhabitable (for humans, that is). But why spoil the dramatic ending? Let's leave you - the viewer - do a little discovering of your own and see this wonderful Pixar Oscar winner!","

"jon.h.ochiai","6 July 2008","""WALL-E"" accomplishes nearly the impossible. During the first half of the movie ""WALL-E"" charms and mesmerizes without any vestige of human dialog. WALL-E is a refuse collecting robot, basically a box with two round camera eyes, left behind on Earth in the distant future. That would be 750 years in the future. Undeniably WALL-E (brilliantly voiced by Ben Bartt) is becoming sentient. In fact the cute robot is a passionate fan of the classic movie ""Hello, Dolly"". Clearly and touchingly, our hero WALL-E is profoundly lonely, and yearns for companionshipperhaps, even love. Perhaps this is a leap of faith beyond mere disbelief, and the distinct beauty of Director and Writer Andrew Stanton's amazing animated feature ""WALL-E"" from Pixar.Pixar is now something like 10 for 10 in making movies that capture and connect with the audience. The CGI and animation are like nothing seen before. In fact the sequences with WALL-E on the desolate Earth wasteland look like live action film. Andrew Stanton's weird and wonderful robot love story also delivers humorously biting commentary on the sedentary direction of our society; as well as punctuates the consequences of not being ""green"". ""WALL-E"" is brilliantly whimsical, hysterical, and surprisingly touching. ""WALL-E"" like its hero has a big heart. ""WALL-E"" tells its story on a vast visually stunning canvas: The CGI and animation are beyond amazing.As we first observe WALL-E, he is doing his programmed deal of collecting and compacting trash in one of Earth's barren metropolises. WALL-E discovers a living plant in the midst of all the garbage. Perhaps this newfound plant indicates that the Earth may again have a viable ecosystem, after over 750 years. A gargantuan space ship arrives, carrying with it a scouting robot, sleek new age Eve (charmingly voiced by Elissa Knight). Apparently, Eve is searching for any signs of life on the long vacated Earth. Obviously, more technologically advanced and powerful Eve appears formidable. However, WALL-E sees in Eve the love of his lifeat least for a robot. Robot hi-jinx ensues. Inevitably WALL-E ends up accompanying Eve back to the displaced human civilization, albeit unintentionally. Ironically WALL-E may be the savior of all of mankind. WALL-E and Eve's adventure becomes a hysterical and ultimately touching journey. ""WALL-E"" is high on cute and fun.Director Stanton creates and navigates contrasting worlds of ""WALL-E"" with ease and confidence. Granted the visuals awe and amaze; however, his storytelling yields ""WALL-E"" its big heart. The fact that the main characters are robots with virtually monosyllabic vocabularies is even more stunning an accomplishment. You really pull for the happy ending for WALL-E and Eve. And they are robots! Okay, this is a Disney and Pixar movie, so you need not worry too much. ""WALL-E"" is sentimental, very sweet, with enough of a quirky edge to keep you guessing. ""WALL-E"" is a great movie, well worth seeing. Pixar has done it, again.","

"tom_koopa","25 December 2009","Wall-E...This movie is truly amazing. Before Wall-E I hadn't seen a movie in which there was no, or almost no, dialog. And yet, using hand gestures or facial expressions, the viewer can perfectly fill in what is going on.But I am getting ahead of myself.Wall-E is the story about a small, clumsy cleaning robot that got left behind on Earth to clean up the mess we, mankind, left behind when we fled for the stars. Poor Wall-E fulfills his daily duty even after hundreds of years. Then, one day, a strange spaceship lands on Earth and deploys a searching drone, called EVE. Wall-E falls in love with the female (apparently) drone, but the feeling isn't mutual. EVE is looking for something important. Wall-E slowly tries to make contact with his mysterious visitor, and eventually succeeds. And when EVE returns with her mission completed, Wall-E follows her. A crazy adventure in space is what results from there...The computer animation art is truly beautiful. Everything looks so smooth, so detailed and so very... alive. You'll forget after awhile that 80% of the characters in this movie are robots. They seem so human! It's a bit hard to explain here.There is very good music in this film too. Very moving, powerful music that fits with the scenes nicely.Like I said, there is almost no dialog. It really adds to this movie and makes it an unique experience.Wall-E is in my honest opinion the best Disney/Pixar movie of 2009. A wonderful movie for young and old; it's a gem you will not forget anytime soon and will probably watch multiple times over the years to come.On a side note, I think it was a nice touch that Sigourney Weaver did the voice for the space ship's computer...Wall-E is definitely a must-see for everyone. Your heart will melt.10 bright stars!","

"Simon_Says_Movies","28 November 2008","There seems to be little possible direction to take when creating an animated film. Of course the setting can be changed along the situations and characters, but I am hinting more towards the target audience. Firstly, there is the option to skew the demographic strongly towards the fledgling crowd with films like Curious George and The Wild. Close behind are those films targeted at a younger, but not greatly adolescent audience, which are embodied in films like Madagascar and Horton Hears a Who! The detrimental aspect of films like these, are that they are for the most part strictly kid-fare, and may put off the unwilling parents, especially after DVD combusts after overuse. Next there is the more risky segment of animated films, in which the creators strive to link the generational gorge and give pleasure on a surplus level. Films like Shrek, The Incredibles and Finding Nemo have been successful at this, but a greater number like Happy Feat, Igor, Barnyard, Monster House and Open Season have been less so. Finally, there lies the risk at the other end of the spectrum, in creating films that may be too mature for less seasoned patrons to understand or keep interested in, such as Ratatouille and The Iron Giant.Then along comes a film like WALL∙E. A film that is so breathtaking and above any level of animation ever before conceived, that will likely thrill older audience members as much as any other movie they view this year, so insightful and profound and complex in it's entirety and absorbing in its tenderness and emotional resonance that everything is whole again. And the best part, your child who may have been bewildered by the mature themes at play, will grow to love, if at least not appreciate, WALL∙E more with each passing year.It would be a lie to claim that WALL∙E is my favourite animated film, or even my favourite conceived through the use of computers, but that is in no way a degrading comment as it is the best animated film in almost five years and still one of the best of all time. If there was ever a year at the Academy Awards to repeat the best picture nomination of The Beauty and the Beast, this would certainly be the one. The cumulative wonder of this feature lies throughout multiple veins of its construction. Setting new lofty standards for animated features to come, the quality of the design achieves a detail and vividness that will astound and consume anyone who gazes upon it. The effects of the terrain, to the details of the robot stars is so impeccable, one is hard pressed to clearly decipher it as animation and not as reality. Yet this is only the icing on the cake, with the foundation spawned from the genius of the story telling itself, without which would demote WALL∙E to eye candy and nothing more. The opening forty-or-so minutes is sans dialog and the ability to keep the level of intrigue at such an engrossing level is a true testament to all those involved, especially veteran Pixar director Andrew Stanton.Meet WALL∙E. Or for those who dislike acronyms, a solitary Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth Class, who spends his days compacting, and neatly stacking towering peaks of garbage on the now barren wasteland that was once Earth. Driven to spend their remaining days on a series of space shuttles by the waste spawned by overconsumption and the greed of a conglomerate, aptly named Buy N Large, mankind has all but forgotten Earth. Not the same can be said for WALL∙E, who was inexplicably skipped after a widespread deactivation of his robot compadres, who, aside from his monotonous task, a loving fascination with the forgotten treasures (or garbage to us) of Earth past, has no greater purpose in life. That is until EVE (Extraterrestial Vegetation Evaluator); a deadly ivory robot sent to search for any signs of life on Earth arrives, and immediately steals the admiration of the little droid. The latter portions of WALL∙E are in the truest sense, a love story, and are comprised of our hero searching for his love after EVE returns to her extraterrestrial home. All acts of this film mesh flawlessly and build upon each other into a sometimes tragic, yet ultimately heart-warming sci-fi fable.While not in the typical sense, WALL∙E is the perfect family film, with its endearing characters and monumental art direction, it may not win over all ages simultaneously but will capture the hearts and imagination of those who let it.","

"fedor8","16 August 2009","The setting is the not-so-distant future. The problems of pollution and garbage disposal have spiraled out of control. Earth has turned into a hostile environment in which only robots and cockroaches can survive. (No, I'm not referring to Al Gore and Sean Penn...) The remainder of humankind leaves the planet, launching itself into space. (No, not the vast realms of empty space in Susan Sarandon's head.) Many centuries later, and the humans on the spaceship have evolved into a highly sophisticated, vigorous race of self-indulgent pigs. (Yes, a world of Beth Dittos.) It's up to a couple of robots to teach the ex-humans to stand up on their pudgy little feet again...""Pixar"" once again affirms its total dominance in the field. Every release is better than the one before it, both visually and conceptually. That other company, the dump that without a hint of irony calls itself ""DreamWorks"", cannot hope to ever reach the levels of visual excellence or good script-writing that their main rivals have reached - i.e. had reached a long time ago. The best animated ""DreamWorks"" produce is far worse than the weakest that ""Pixar"" had ever done. ""Shrek"", ""Antz"" and ""Madagascar"" - just to name a few - combine to show a textbook example of a company's (creative) failure to compete with its superior rivals. (The immense commercial success of this garbage company stems from the fact that fans of ""Shrek"" are much like the chunky, semi-daft humanoids that inhabit Eve's spaceship - already quite a few of those!) Not entirely surprising, given the fact that His Royal Tinseltownic Highness The Master Schmaltz-Maker Steven Spielberg co-founded it. Of course it was going to suck! Whatever Spielberg's greedy little fingers touch nearly always amounts to nothing.Apart from the excellent visuals, the solid gags, and the likable characters (even the humanoid swine are made out to be likable), ""Wall-e"" has the advantage of having a peculiar and refreshing distinction: because there is very little real dialogue, there are practically no annoying familiar actors' voices to be heard. Apparently, Sigourney Weaver lends her voice to someone, something or other, but I hadn't even noticed it. In other words, no Tom Hanks, no Mike Myers, no Cameron Diaz... a welcome relief. Most lines consist of ""Wall-e!!!!"" and ""Eve...?"" - and that's just fine as it is.How do overweight people watch this film? I guess ""Pixar"" must have consciously gone the risk of alienating at least a fifth of its potential viewership. Nevertheless, they landed another hit. Could it be that overweight people didn't recognize themselves on the screen? And why was there no organization called The Anti-Defamation Of Fatties League protesting outside of America's cinemas?","

"paulo20","30 November 2008","Nothing much to say, really, about the animation. PIXAR steps it up another notch. Simply stunning, which is par for the course for PIXAR. I gave the film six stars and at least five of them go to the visuals.However, the story didn't really match those visuals. And the two robot leads were cute, I'll grant, but not much more than that.SPOILERS FOLLOW.Basically, humans created the mess that made it necessary for them to leave the planet. And we're supposed to root for them to come back? I'm sorry, I just don't get it. It's not a strong enough reason for me to root for the protagonists. And the antagonists are, likewise, not compelling enough, with no real apparent motivation for keeping the humans from re-inhabiting earth, unless it's to protect the earth from humans overloading the world with trash again, in which case, I'm not sure we shouldn't have rooted for them instead.And what about the other species? We see fish in the end credits. Presumably, the planet was okay for them and other species? The movie doesn't really go into that, unless I missed something.Meanwhile, while the humans were away, they came to rely on being carted around on hover-chairs. As the film explains, this leads to some bone loss. And their ability to walk has apparently atrophied over the centuries. Only it hasn't, as we see the uniformly obese humans learn to walk again, much like overgrown infants learn to walk. Perhaps this is meant to be symbolic, but it doesn't make a lot of logical sense.Finally, I'm not sure why a live action Fred Willard was used, but this is a minor point. Given the rest of the movie, I find that I really don't care. I just find it a little odd.","

Compared to say Toy Story where character and comedy can be injected by amazing actors - Wall.e relies primarily upon the skill of its story telling and talented animators to convey all the emotion needed. A considerable section of the movie opening is without words - so the talent of Pixar stares straight at youA diligent and thoughtful robot - Wall.e - is seemingly the last robot running on earth. A mysterious new robot comes to earth and a fantastic love story ensues. The story itself AND the way it's told are flawless. Perfect.

"Red_Flag","20 July 2008","Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Ratatouille. It would be a bit of an understatement to say that Pixar has had its fair share of successes both critically and commercially. So its comes as no surprise then that their latest WALLE manages to not only outdo all of Pixar's previous attempts but it also manages top spot on 2008 score board. So effortlessly brilliant that it manages to captivate its audience even when no words are being spoken. Both WALLE and EVE will, undoubtedly go down in history as two of the most charming and influential characters of all time.Sure there is a dip in quality when both robots leave earth to board the mother ship but even with this dip it still manages to soar avoid all previous attempts at creating what I perceive as the perfect animated film only really out shone by Princess Mononoke 11 years before. For this generation at least WALLE manages to be the greatest animated film, filled with warmth and wonder and so brilliantly original. Miss this and your missing 08's very best.Disney and Pixar join forces for this computer-animated tale about a wide-eyed robot who travels to the deepest reaches of outer space in search of a newfound friend. The year is 2700, and planet Earth has long been uninhabitable.For hundreds of years, WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) has been taking out the trash, and collecting precious knick-knacks in order to stave off the boredom of his dreary routine. Little does WALL-E realize that he has recently stumbled onto a secret that could save planet Earth, and once again make the ravaged planet safe for all humankind.When highly advanced search robot EVE makes friends with WALL-E and realizes the value of his remarkable discovery, she excitedly races back to let the humans know that there's hope for their home planet after all. But after centuries alone in space, WALL-E can't stand the thought of losing the only friend he's ever known, and eagerly follows her into the deepest reaches of space on the adventure of a lifetime. Along the way, the friendly trash-collecting robot who has always known what he was made for gradually begins to understand what he was meant for. Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton returns to the helm for this family-friendly sci-fi adventure featuring the voices of Fred Willard, Jeff Garlin, and Ben Burtt.The main credit deserves to go to mastermind director Andrew Stanton who so confidently glides these characters round their fully believable world. What with this being his third feature film there's no doubt he knows his movies. The cramped sub-section is quite easily forgiven thanks to WALLE powerful presence. Trust me this is a stunning film.VERDICT: Pixar are no strangers to success. With each film being stunningly entertaining. WALLE is no exception. The film is soaked in character with both WALLE and EVE being flawlessly charming. 2008 best film by far bold, beautiful achievement.","

"MartianOctocretr5","13 July 2008","Imaginative settings, lovable and memorable characters, well utilized animation, impressive visuals, clever gags (never over-done), and one of the sweetest screen romances in the history of movies: Wall-E has a lot to offer. You can't help pulling for this sympathetic, lonely little guy, a rusty old robot who continues his programming of cleaning up trash in a deteriorating world mysteriously devoid of humans. His curiosity, fascination, and wonder about the odd artifacts he excavates during his job make him the most endearingly innocent and lovable droid since C-3PO and R2-D2. His lone buddy is a cockroach of all things, and even this unique friendship is depicted in a touching way that makes Wall-E's goodness shine through. Rarely is an animated film this intelligent and touching. Other films of its ilk are humorous, often with cultural references, and Wall-E's adventure is too. However, the cultural references aren't just dumped in for a one-note sight gag as in other flicks: they are integral elements of building the story. For example, the jabs at cell phones, TV, credit cards, autos, computer overuse, internet shopping are hilarious, while also painting the woeful future that the movie envisions. I love the Capt. Stubing and Hal 9000 satires (they too are principals in what happens, not just walk-on gags). The character of Eve (right down to her mysterious mission) was wonderfully done. Bravo on this one. A very entertaining film with a lot of heart. Brilliantly done.","

This happens from time to time and then I start second guessing myself. But you know, one doesn't have to like what everyone else does, and in that respect, there's a fair amount of negative reviews for this picture as well.

"benjm","7 July 2008","I join the gushing majority and say this is one amazingly done, very touching and important film. 1. A Masterpiece of Computer Graphics & Story TellingWhen computers were still in training pants 25 years ago, I studied, worked with and taught computer graphics. I've often watched an animated film (or live film with injected animation) with knowing appreciation at some use of or advance in computer graphics technology. I have a friend who had been involved managing computer graphics projects for some of the previous Star Wars movies. We have previously discussed the ""state of the art"" and where it's going. The surprise to me in this film wasn't that they could do graphics of this quality now. It was amazement at the scope, effort, skill and creative genius I know it takes to make something so beautiful and moving.Watching the film, my feelings went from astonishment at the graphics to deep empathy and feeling for the main characters. The people around me gasped and say ""wow"" just the same. You don't need experience or friends like mine to tell you that nothing else has come this close to looking so real and gorgeous, to feel so visceral and well-crafted. The use of modern live-action cinematic effects is stunning beyond words. The film's reliance on the intelligence of children and adults to understand the serious thoughts and complex emotions being conveyed, well, is just simply an amazing and reassuring experience. And I thought the closing credit art (using different styles of famous artists) was very cool too.2. Some Small Nitpicks: Most of the time I felt I was watching an exceptionally crafted film with a tight story and a serious message about the current problems of and future prospects for Earth. An then something would happen in the film that would be, like, ""Huh? That doesn't quite make sense or follow, but it's just animation"". I found 2-3 moments where I was shifted from sobering reality to forgivable fantasy, and it was a bit jarring and distracting But these moments can be easily forgotten with the continuation of the next amazing scene.It looks like the quality (time, money, computer horse-power)spent on the main characters is much more than what was spent on depicting the humans. Heck, even the garbage get's more realistic treatment than the people. And then there is the live video of Scott Willard as the ""Executive in Chief"" talking to the planet....The styles don't mesh well for me. I appreciate the thought-line that the humans look more cartoon because of the surreal and clueless nature of their existence on the ship, as well as our inept and greedy custodianship of the planet. I can imagine that the live video is meant to help connect children with the cartoon-nature of certain government officials and the patronizing policies they always on display these days on the evening news. Maybe this is all true, but it's probably also a way to rationalize a limited budget and time schedule. The bottom-line for me that the discrepancies between the treatments didn't work that well for me.Most of the time the characters are so extremely cute and lovable, it's a complement to their creators. But sometimes the cultural cliché's and visual slapstick are a bit much. Overall, it all adds up to a very sweet and moving film, but just a little less ""shtick"" would have been fine by me.Some thoughts on other reviews I've read here:Is the Message Too Heavy-Handed? I don't think so. It's mainly aimed at small kids. They get it, and they take it to heart. Maybe the question should be ""is the message loud enough?"" We earthlings still don't seem to be getting the message. Last I checked, we were still busy polluting the air, water, soil and every life form on the planet...oh, and ruining our climate also. We are feeding our families and enjoying ourselves, but sorry we are each helping to destroy the planet along the way. ""Oh well. It's not like I can make a difference"". Let's just leave the problem for the kids. Good luck kids! Do you think mom and dad are making ""good choices?""It's a moment of truth for us. Are we up to it? Are we truly awake yet and smelling the rising levels of toxicity in our environment? Maybe the message was said softer people would get it more?Regarding those people who have posted negatively, that they couldn't connect, and even thought of walking out...everyone is absolutely entitled to their opinion and to state it. But, gosh, If this film didn't make them gasp at beauty, smile warmly, laugh knowingly...if it didn't put a lump in your throat or make an eye or two teary, then...that's just sad, and even a bit scary.If you haven't seen this film yet, run and see it on the big screen while you can. I think you will enjoy taking some kids. You will see them enthralled and fully-attuned to the message. It's a good thing.","

"matlefebvre20","11 June 2009","""WALL-E"" represents the perfect mix between innovation and tradition. Pixar, the supreme leader in computer animation, has conceived a feature film which expands animation to a technical level which had never been reached before while treating it with very simple narrative concepts, which we could recall from old silent movies from the era of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.The director of ""WALL-E"", Andrew Stanton, treats his movie as a huge tribute to science fiction, by inserting many different themes and concepts, such as robotics, interstellar travel, the apocalyptic concept of a desert Earth, mega-corporations and space colonization.""WALL-E"" is a family movie, but that doesn't necessarily mean that audiences have to content themselves with simple themes and ideas. And it's fine. But the fact that the movie works so well is intrinsically linked to the genius of Pixar's screenwriters. Those guys have effectively created a complex story with an extremely simple narrative structure.The story opens around year 2800. The first shot opens on a spatial background with planets and galaxies and the camera then moves to reveal the Earth. But is that really the Earth? A first look seems to show our planet enveloped in a yellowish atmosphere, contrasting with the ocean blue to which we're so accustomed. When the camera then zooms upon the Earth, our initial fears are confirmed: the whole planet is a huge desert, complete with totally empty cities and huge towers of garbage compacted in cubes. That sight fills the entire landscape.Those garbage towers are the work of WALL-E, the hero of the movie. For the last 700 years, his workdays are exactly the same: he picks up the garbage he finds (and he's far from lacking of work on that level), transforms it in huge cubes and organizes them in towers. But he keeps in his shelter a few objects which catch his attention and which he doesn't dare to sacrifice.And then one day, a huge rocket arrives from the sky. From it appears EVE, a female robot whose primary function is to inspect the Earth in order to determine if it can sustain life once again. The timid WALL-E makes contact with EVE and shows her his artifacts, among them is a small plant, an ordinary discovery for WALL-E, but a rather significant one for EVE.In less time that it takes to say it, the two robots find themselves aboard the giant spaceship Axiom, where human beings, now ridiculously obese, gelatinous and lazy, live in an Utopian lifestyle, courtesy of the Buy 'n Large mega-corporation.WALL-E and EVE live an extraordinary and thrilling adventure during which they will fall in love. Yes, you read that well. Not only do the robots in this movie have a well-defined gender, they are also able to express emotions as strong as love.Even if some of the robots in this movie have a language and a vocabulary as developed as humans, most of them communicate with only a few words, often pronounced in a slow and detached way. WALL-E, for example, reminded me of R2-D2, since he primarily communicates and expresses himself with electronic sounds rather than with syllables. And I think it's way better that way, because it makes him more innocent, more charming and more attractive than if he'd expressed himself with more words.The way that these robots express their state of mind lies mostly in specific movements, body language and facial expressions. For example, when WALL-E curls up his mechanical limbs towards his body while lowering his tremendous ""eyes"" (actually cameras), you don't need words to explain what he's feeling. That's the same situation for EVE. She has some kind of video screen instead of a face, where luminous blue spots light up to simulate eyes. When those blue spots are arranged in her face in such or such pattern, a very precise feeling is expressed.What a fusion! I had never seen such a convincing mix of technology and emotion in a film before. Even in ""A.I."", where a robot designed to look like a boy is programmed to express love.This masterstroke is due to the animators at Pixar, who clearly demonstrates once again who is the master in the domain of computer animation. Not only character animation is exceptional, but the presentation of an apocalyptic desert world is also breathtaking. The realism of the opening scenes is mystifying for an animated movie. There are some moments in which you could forget that you're watching an animated film.""WALL-E"" is an excellent science fiction movie, but it's also an excellent tribute to science fiction movies. Andrew Stanton has inserted in his film a lot of references to pictures such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Star Wars"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Idiocracy"" and ""I Am Legend"". And in the great tradition of Disney movies, important life lessons are learned in ""WALL-E"", and their importance is as capital as it can be, considering the state of the Earth after humans have decided that it was easier for them to forget those precious life lessons.However, I found very ironic the fact that a Disney picture would carry a message against mega-corporations and against the concept of brand loyalty.Overall, ""WALL-E"" is an absolutely extraordinary movie. Fans of animation and science fiction will surely appreciate it for its technical and narrative qualities, but families and kids will definitely fall under the charm of those two robots and their heart-melting love story. A must-see!","

"dfranzen70","28 June 2008","I wish I could say that this movie was on par with earlier Pixar movies, but I just can't. The animation isn't bad, it's just that unlike the undersea world in Finding Memo or the toy chest in Toy Story, there's just nothing pretty to look at for large chunks of time. And because the main characters are robots who don't exactly speak English well, the movie depends rather heavily on two things: the visual landscape and the nonlinguistic communication of the metal duo. As a result, the movie isn't quite as charming or self-effacing as its predecessors, but it's still amiable and heartwarming when it needs to be.WALL-E is the last remaining robot on Earth. See, the place got so polluted that everyone had to zoom off to ships in outer space just to survive; the plan is to let the WALL-E units compact and store all the garbage, and when life can be sustainable again, the humans will return. This was 700 years ago. And every day, WALL-E compacts trash (all the other units have broken down), blissfully un-self-aware. The humans send down probes to determine if life can return to the planet, and that's when our WALL-E meets EVE, who's quite a bit more advanced and intelligent than WALL-E.WALL-E is adorable. He looks quite a bit like Johnny 5 from the Short Circuit films, and he's about as smart and curious. As he collects and compacts trash, he grabs various items that seem interesting to him and stores them in his storage crate. But although he's been at it for centuries, his world's turned upside down when Eve the probe arrives on Earth in search of plant life. Wouldn't you know it, our inquisitive little toaster falls in love at first sight with the sleek Eve, who looks sort of like a giant toe (her visor would be the toe nail - try to stay with me on this).On Earth, although the atmosphere is lighthearted and full of hope, the scenery (and hence the overall look and feel of the movie) is downbeat and gloomy; everything's washed out in a sea of brown and gray. The planet's a wasteland, you see, along the lines of the postapocalyptic horror of Mad Max.But once we leave the planet and land on the ship Avion, things perk up. Here, everything's red or blue (the colors in the BuyNLarge logo - that's the conglomerate that owned, like, everything on the planet and that now owns and operates the deep-space ships. You should see these places - the whole idea is that the humans will never have to lift a finger. Robots wake them up. They're dumped onto these motorized recliners that whisk them everywhere. They shop and drink milkshakes from their recliners. They literally never move. So of course they're all tremendously overweight.Can WALL-E and Eve help bring life back to Earth? It's a Disney/Pixar film, so you probably already know the answer, and if you thought about it for a second, you could probably map out how the movie would shake out. But one thing you might not realize is that for a G-rated movie, there's a lot of tense, scary-toned scenes. There are several moments when you're led to believe something incredibly awful has happened to WALL-E, and unlike in its cartoon progenitors there's a perceptible delay before it's revealed he's okay - long enough for you to wonder if, indeed, he is.So I was a little surprised to find out this was a G-rated movie. Aside from the desolate, acrid, lifeless landscape of Earth, there are plenty of robot-in-peril scenes, sequences that seem more action-movie-like than cartoonish. This is partly because Pixar's animation is so advanced now that WALL-E looks and behaves exactly as you'd expect a robot in real life would. Which brought me to this question: Why even make an animated movie about robots? It's not as if you're giving human qualities to, say, a fish or a stuffed animal; you're anthropomorphizing something that's already been given human qualities.In short, WALL-E lacked the amazing, imaginative premise and theme that earlier classics had. I wasn't bowled over by the animation, and I just wasn't terribly impressed with the execution. WALL-E is not a bad movie by any means, but it suffers by comparison with its own ancestors. In the end, it's done in by its subject matter (not conducive to gorgeous animation), its setting (vast, colorless), and its penchant for robot-in-peril scenes.","

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","1 July 2008","There's no reason Disney/Pixar's ""WALL-E"" shouldn't be able to compete with 2008's best films just because it's animated. Pixar compacts so much great material into this film, including incredible CGI, that I prefer it to live action. Live action could not tell the incredible story of WALL-E, the most admirable and lovable animated character to grace the screen in what feels like ages. This is truly Pixar's masterpiece: a film that takes everything you know about animated movies and rockets above and beyond it.Almost instantaneously, you fall in love with WALL-E, the only intelligent being left on Earth, which has become a wasteland full of trash, to which WALL-E is assigned to crush and organize in piles. It's remarkable how quickly Andrew Stanton's character connects with you. His love of collecting things we know as everyday objects as artifacts, his love of music and movies--the only of which he has is ""Hello, Dolly!""--and just the way he goes through his day creates something so deeply and essentially human that it's impossible not to like him. He is diligent, curious, a bit of a klutz and he's infatuated with the notion of finding true love. Almost everyone can relate to that.WALL-E's world gets flipped upside down when a spaceship lands and produces EVE, a robot dispatched to Earth by the humans now living off-planet who is responsible for searching for organic life. WALL-E is instantly love-struck and courageously pursues meeting and getting to know EVE. Eventually, he follows her back to the Axiom, a ship which is full of humans but run by robots. This is where ""WALL-E"" goes from being a really creative and well-written film to an amazingly creative, clever and even intelligent film. It does this by painting a grim and horrifying picture of humanity that comes across as deplorable but amusing--a non- threatening but nevertheless negative depiction of a universe where humans over- commercialize and consolidate Earth and end up living their lives in space, sitting in mobile chairs and relying on robots for everything. In this sense the film borrows from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (it even borrows Strauss' music at one comical point as an homage)All throughout this plot line is the love story between WALL-E and EVE, an unusual but very basic plot in the film. Unusual in that it's not covered in drama, but simple in that the two help save each other and that dedication fosters a love and a desire to not be lonely emotionless robots unlike the stoic species that humans in the film have become. The fact that the inventive and lively robots in this film who say barely anything capture our attention gain our approval more than the humans in the film says a lot about the job that Andrew Stanton and Pixar have done with ""WALL-E""Top that off with CGI that convinces you you're not watching CGI at times along with some great action sequences and this is a truly special movie. I haven't felt so moved by an animated film since I was 5 years old watching ""Lady and the Tramp."" Name another Pixar film you love and this one makes it look amateurish. If you have any appreciation for good visual storytelling, you will love this film and easily pardon its lack of dialogue and occasional slow parts because of the piece of art that it is.","

"gavin6942","11 December 2014","In the distant future, a small waste collecting robot inadvertently embarks on a space journey that will ultimately decide the fate of mankind.What makes this film so great is how for most of the film (at least the first half), most of the story is told silently. Or, that is, at least without dialogue. To do that and still hold an audience's attention is a good feat. The artwork is also amazing, quite possibly the best Pixar film up to this point (2014).The ecology theme is nice, but more than a little blunt. A ship full of fat earthlings who are so lazy they do not even know they have a pool? Now, it is one thing to say the future has the planet covered in trash (""Idiocracy"" made a similar claim), but this is just too blunt...","

"safenoe","15 December 2022","Along with Up, I think WALL-E (pronounced Wallee or Wally) is a masterpiece and has a strong social message which is pronounced towards the end for sure. My only complaint was I saw it in a cinema and the moron at the back of me used my seat as his foot rester, so after that I hardly go to cinemas.Anyway, Sigourney Weaver of Alien fame (ironic of course) is one of the voices, along with many others. The animation is captivating, and Wall-E has loads of life to him that make it quite emotional viewing for sure.I was impressed that last year Congress selected Wall-E for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","1 October 2023","A robot works hard to clean up the garbage that humanity has amassed on Earth.This is very effective at making the audience empathize with characters that don't look human other than maybe their eyes. Part of it has no spoken English dialogue, we only hear words from old media, but because of the strong visual storytelling, we're never confused as to what is going on and how we are to feel about it. While a good chunk of it is about getting to know the world and less about plot, it's never boring. It is a little creepy how much of the love story is one sided a guy pining for a girl(who is often impatient, and whose anger is outright destructive in a display of sexism on the part of the creatives), especially that some of it is just him watching her from afar, following her around where she goes, even though she doesn't even know that he's there. I think it was supposed to register as sweet, and for many, I'm sure it does. At least he does also try to take care of her when she is unresponsive.This may well have better use of light and color than all the ones leading up to it, and create a fully realised world that you can understand how functions, and appreciate that we really don't want things to end up that way. The environmentalist message is better communicated than an almost any other movie that has that leaning that I've seen: not trying to scare people with the idea that we might be attacked by something if we don't get this right, rather, underlining all that we'd lose, not to mention all the we can do to fight it, while we still have time. Not a fan of the film equating obesity to laziness.I recommend this to everyone. 9/10.","

"swimmercait","29 June 2008","Many are complaining about the hypocritical message that Disney/Pixar is offering by making a movie about the evils of commercialism and capitalism and then marketing it and its products. On that point they've missed the mark because it's not about the evils of commercialism and capitalism, it's about gluttony and what can happen when you stop paying attention. I think the movie itself is a representation of this, don't get distracted by Wall-E's charm, Eve's streamlined features, and the ever mesmerizing animation. Instead pause and remember the film is trying to offer you something besides entertainment. If you just sit there and let the film wash over you, you've only had a pleasurable experience (not unlike a smooth hover chair ride). But if you engage with Wall-E, Eve, the captain and their struggles you can take away more from the theatre, you'll need to get out of your hover chair to do it though and actually take a good look at the stars outside. Secondly environmentalism, capitalism, commercialism, monopolies, and so forth were not the only topics addressed in this film. I felt undercurrents of both self-discovery and appreciation for others uniqueness. Wall-E apparently already wasn't quite like other robots. He's curious, inventive, and protective. However Wall-E doesn't learn what he's really made of until he takes his journey into space to ""save"" Eve. There he proves that he's not only loyal and creative but also courageous, tenacious, and friendly. This rounds out his character as a hero and one that changes over the course of the story even though he was designed with a single purpose. Eve is purposeful, career-oriented, and a little bit dangerous. She does her job well and defines herself by her directives. Through her journey she expands her programming by learning what friends can and will do for one another. She learns other things are sometimes more important than carry out your duties. No more clearly does she learn this lesson then at the end of the film when the Wall-Eness of Wall-E seems to have disappeared. I feel this is also the point in the film that drives home the message of self-discovery and individuality. Without that certain spark, Wall-E is just like all the other Wall-Es around him. Finally there is the captain. No one knows how he got his position on the ship but however it happened his position merely has the illusion of power. From the trailers I thought the captain was going to be the villain of the story, but he is a good guy and he too goes on a journey of growth and exploration. It seems he is just like the other humans, but instead he proves himself to be capable of bettering himself through self-starting education and changing the way he functions on a daily basis. Though he remains somewhat a bumbling character throughout the film he does the right thing and passes his newfound knowledge and hope onto the other humans. On that note stick around until the credits start scrolling on black. The story doesn't end when the computer animation does. This story was told mostly without words so when the other sound effects leave the screen don't assume the message ends. At that point the purest form of film is left: story through images. I think the negative reviewers forgot that too.","

"thesar-2","2 July 2009","Too bad, this ninth Pixar feature didn't jump on the 3-D bandwagon until the 10th: 'Up.' 'Wall-E' would've been even better in 3-D. Though, I can't see much to improve on. The story, the character development, the special-effects, the comedy and the message are all top-notch. In fact, this is just another work of art/cinema. As a science-fiction/space adventure, it actually leaves a lot of the live-action movies in the space dust. This one, despite the computer animation, is so incredibly realistic; I thought I was watching real-life scenes. And the best news yet: it's never about the F/X. It's about the story – the essence I always look for when deciding to buy a movie ticket. We live in an era that gives us 'Transformers' (or part 2) that gives us NO SOUL, or script, and we follow along like we're shopping at Wal-mart, sorry, I mean ""Buy'N'Large."" I can't rate a movie that doesn't excel on plot/story/originality. Wall-E does that. He's a compact little machine that's directive is to clean up the mess of a world we made 700 years from now. Until he meets a probe, Eve, that's sent to look for signs of life. Ironically, her mission, or being, in turn gives him life and on goes the adventure when he follows her into space to meet the human (and robot) survivors ready to return once Earth's inhabitable again. In a word, this movie's a masterpiece. Finally, a movie void of almost complete dialogue, you rely on body language and silent love. Rarely does a look show love in movies. In fact, for the most part, we're shoved love down our throats by words. Hardly is it shown with true love. Strangely, we have to turn to robots to open our eyes. Do not miss this movie.","

"snoozejonc","9 April 2021","WALL. E is a refuse disposal robot helping to tidy up planet Earth when he meets another robot called EVE.This is a brilliant film with some of the best visual storytelling I've ever seen.The story is wonderfully uplifting, full of comedy, emotion and a healthy amount of satire and social commentary.It says a lot by how invested you can be in two main characters who are not actually human but exhibit more humanity than the supporting characters who are.The movie's depiction of what people people could eventually become is quite thought provoking in an entertaining way. There is a lot to be said about mass consumerism, uselessness and the hypnotic control that is 'screen time'.There is nothing I can write that would do justice to how effectively the visuals communicate not only what is happening but the feelings of the characters. It is safe to say that a film with very little dialogue that can make my 5 year old daughter laugh and cry in the intended places due to the actions and mannerisms of two robots is an immense work of art.As always with Pixar, the animation is unbelievably realistic and full of beautiful, colourful and incredibly textured images. It's depiction of the future is not overly positive, but highly imaginative and up there with the best dystopian visions in classic cinema. The technology is very Apple in style, whilst at the same time it pays tribute to the more retro creations like the Short Circuit robot design of Number 5. Stanley Kubric's '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a massive influence and this is reflective in a number of nice homages.At the time of writing this is my favourite Pixar movie.","

"moutonbear25","29 June 2008","To be animated can mean a number of things. While it obviously refers to the artistic process in which still images are strewn together in sequences to appear as though they are moving, it can also mean to bring someone or something to life. Pixar Animation Studios are masters of both of these animated meanings and their genius lies in their seemingly effortless ability to accomplish both of these feats simultaneously. In the studio's history, they have managed to make toys playful when no one else was looking, the plight of a bunch of ants seem monumental and rats in the kitchen somehow not only normal but entirely justifiable. Despite all of these milestones, Pixar has outdone themselves with their ninth feature, WALLE. It might be unfair to suggest that no other company could accomplish this but there is certainly no other company that could have done as good a job. WALLE is short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class and the character himself is a collapsible box with curiously wide eyes that gets around on tank treads and solar power. He may be made up of nothing but rusting metal and parts that need frequent replacing but he is also the most endearing, romantic dreamer that Pixar has ever crafted. You just want to squeeze the little guy. Trust me; the tetanus shot you'd need after that would be totally worth it.WALLE takes place about 700 or so years from now. Taking an abnormally critical stance on humanity's penchant to waste without fear of consequence, three-time Pixar director, Andrew Stanton (A BUG'S LIFE, FINDING NEMO), paints the future earth as being uninhabitable. It seems that somewhere around the year 2100, there will be so much garbage on the planet that not only will we need to stack it as high as the highest skyscrapers but we will also need to vacate the planet until the mess is brought under control. Enter WALLE. Hundreds of similar units will work over the next six or seven centuries on a job that was only meant to last five years. The humans who once fled have inevitably all passed on but their future generations continue to float through space on giant cruise ships, oblivious to their history and unaware of their present selves. After so much time has passed, humanity has succumbed to its laziest impulses. We no longer require the need to think for ourselves when we have a multi-conglomerate doing it for us or the need to walk from here to there when we have a ""hoverchair"" to bypass this menial task. Earth is practically a forgotten memory for all but it is still there. Despite being covered in smog and dust and despite also a failed mission to clean up the mess, one WALLE unit remains to keep the pursuit of love, happiness and hope alive.WALLE is an unfortunate loner and even though his closest companion is loyal cockroach, he never loses faith. He presses on every day in his near impossible mission to make earth inhabitable again without discouragement and with a nagging sensation that there is more to life than this. Considering he isn't actually alive, that's pretty impressive. When another robot, EVE, arrives on earth to search for signs of sustainable life, WALLE finally gets the chance to see and understand what that greater meaning might be. Aside from being an eco-friendly science fiction piece, WALLE is also a moving romance that is unexpected and unmatched by most recent films featuring actual human beings. When WALLE first sees EVE, he knows it is love at first sight. He proceeds to follow her around everywhere she goes, shyly inching closer towards her whenever he feels the moment might be right. He is like a teenager in love for the first time. He doesn't know how to make his move, just that he always wants to be around her. There is no desperation born out of ages of loneliness, just a certainty in what is in the air. The courtship of WALLE and EVE is so innocent and simple that it seems almost silly that we as humans should have such trouble getting it right. WALLE's ride is pretty smooth, full of laughs, touching moments and inspired cinematography (under the meticulous guidance of contemporary visionary, Roger Deakins) but all of this is expected from the Pixar peeps. There is a misguided attempt to incorporate live-action into the mix that adds a slight level of confusion but can do nothing to take away from the deeply satisfying whole. It is quite an extensive journey and it rests on the shoulders of one little waste management robot. WALLE is unforgettable. His curiosity is matched only by his appreciation for everything in life that humanity has left behind. He may be goofy and clumsy but he is always open to possibility and hope. He is more alive than I am most of the time and the bewilderment and awe that fill his optical devices opened my eyes to things I had stopped seeing altogether. How can so much yearning and wonder come from one little robot, let alone one that is not actually made of real metal but rather drawn that way? WALLE is simply a marvel to behold and the pinnacle of Pixar's progressive mission to redefine what it means to animate.","

"paul2001sw-1","20 June 2011","I quite like some of Pixar's films, but I tend to feel that they're somewhat overpraised, and there's certainly a theme linking their protagonists, who have variously been cute talking toys, cute talking insects, cute talking monsters, cute talking fish, and cute talking cars. Prior to watching I didn't have that much anticipation for 'WALL-E', about a (presumably cute talking) robot - but how wrong I was. The robot doesn't talk for a start, and the film has the most extraordinary animation I have seen, notably for its inventiveness, attention to detail and sheer beauty. Indeed, many of the scenes have a balletic grace, with obvious nods to 2001 but also (especially in the first half of the film, where there's barely a word of dialogue), to the silent movie era (was I the only one reminded of Chaplin's skating scene in 'Modern Times' by some of the choreography?) Throw in a truly eerie and disturbing portrait of a post-habitable earth in which even (almost all) the robots have died out, and an opposing dystopia of a space ark where humanity survives in total comfort and zero dignity, and you have many of the elements in place of a classic film. Perhaps inevitably, the second half (while still good) is more like a traditional Pixar movie, the story of the triumph of the underdog and the audacity of hope; yet the overall tone of the movie is such, that when the ending threatens to be very sad, you have no idea whether there will be a final happy twist or it will leave you in tears. Until now, even when I've liked good animations, I've scoffed at those who argue they rival the best ""real"" films - but 'WALL-E' is a genuine artistic achievement, and wholly deserving of its praise.","

"Robert_duder","15 January 2009","I wanted to see Wall-E from the minute I saw the trailers. I thought he looked adorable and the film looked cute and then the reviews said it was kind of dark and very little dialog and finally I got to see it. I was moved, blown away, excited by it, cheering for it...I fell head over heels for Wall-E and it's completely original and touching love story. Essentially I believe Wall-E is indeed a love story...both between two completely different robot entities and between a robot and his world. The animation is brilliant from the completely obliterated world of earth to the enormous futuristic ship and the adventure is non stop fun!! Despite some reviewers opinions of the film being too dark and too preachy for kids I think its a case of over analyzing because the film is fun and cute as it is serious. Yes the film does have a strong message but it is still told in animation for anyone and everyone to enjoy and the story is still happily ever after in the end. The amazing thing is the film makers really make this relationship between Wall-E and Eve so strong and so powerful and so cute that you will feel a romance between two robots. Something only Disney could do...or Pixar in this case.Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight are just brilliant as the voices of Wall-E and Eve respectively. Knight's pleading voice twirping ""Walll-Eee"" will forever be a classic moment in animated films. Burtt makes Wall-E come to life and however digitized the voice may be he still gives the character depth and soul. Jeff Garlin is terrific as the overweight Captain who fights the system to save his people. Fred Willard is a great comedian but I found his performance a little monotone in the film and misplaced considering his part. Pixar favorite John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy (Peggy Hill) are residents John and Mary and although they have small roles they are really great in their roles.Wall-E has been heralded with great reviews and numerous award nominations and I think is sure to walk away with an Animated Academy Award at the very least and it is completely well deserved. In classic Pixar style the film can be completely enjoyed by adults and children the same. Considering the first 30-45 minutes is Wall-E exploring the barren earth and setting up his character you will love every minute of it. You will be enthralled with Wall-E and the movie right from the very beginning. He is a subtle hero of the utmost. Pixar director Andrew Stanton has had his hand in at least six of the most popular animated films of the last decade including Toy Story one and two...which I think was a stepping stone in the current level of animation we see now. Wall-E is a feat of animation and will be a new bar of standards to future Pixar animations as well as other companies. An absolute must see for everyone. 9.5/10","

"bobsgrock","3 July 2008","It all started back in 1995. I was only 6 years old, but I was forever changed when I first saw Toy Story. Today, it is one of my favorite movies as well as a breakthrough for all animated movies. Now, 13 years later, Pixar is still going at it. After all these years, I can honestly say they have never made a bad movie, and they have also made some really excellent movies that in the future will be absolute classics (Toy Story, The Incredibles, Ratatouille). Wall-E is undoubtedly the most ambitious task they have undertaken to date with a serious lack of dialogue and a story that has universal appeal. For the first half hour, the only sounds heard are those made by the robots. Yet, the story moves along just fine and it is quite easy to understand what is going on. This is due to the incredible storytelling ability by the Pixar team as well as the extraordinary animation you cannot look away from. Seriously, you will wonder if some shots are shot with a real camera they are so clear and beautiful. With robots being the main characters, it is a bit more difficult for the audience to relate to them, but director Andrew Stanton does a perfect job of personifying them as well as making them very likable. The romance between Wall E and EVE is very cheesy, but so well done you can't help but smile. Be aware, this movie is not just for children. Adults will be amazed by the animation as well as the thought-provoking themes brought up about the future and just how much humans should rely on technology. Elements of 2001 and I Am Legend aside, this is one of the top 5 Pixar movies and definitely one of the best movies of 2008.","

C.Eastwood , namely , the 'older' she is ,the better she is !), musical scenes are all fused into this cinematic evergreen ! Yes, as an adult and a sort of a movie buff , I simply cannot believe what kind of satisfaction and personal hopes of a better world in the middle of an interpersonal , financial and moral crisis this cartoon has reignited in me , again stressing the most basic cosmic and religious rule that love is possible ,that a better world is possible , that peace is possible ! And , what more can you wish for !","

"haydendeepsy","4 June 2021","What can one say about this movie that hasn't already been said? That it's a masterpiece? That, along with any other praise has already been given to Pixar's truly greatest achievement. WALL-E is the only Waste Allocation Load Lifter left on Earth. He, along with many other units where created by the company BnL, in an attempt to clean the mess of trash on Earth, while the humans would take a 5 year cruise on the Axiom spaceship and await the result, without having to face the consequences of their actions on their home Planet. 700 years later, Our WALL-E is the only one still functioning, and is now the only inhabitant of the planet, as there has been no news in regards to the humans. The fact that WALL-E is presented to us with such a human personality, other than building empathy for the character, works in a sense that having lived alone on the planet for so long, he started to understand it and see it with curiosity, a primary human emotion, while still serving his purpose of waste allocator. Onother great personality trait is that of EVE, who before encountering WALL-E, was but one of many Extrterrestrial Vegetation Evaluators, but after receiving a different form of attention, it started to express it's emotions in a different way. For example, when she first arrives and begins her search for biological life, she has a very robotic approach to it, but as she starts to receive a new type of attention, she begins to feel more human like when she can't find what she is looking for, getting frustrated and vocally expressing it. That which happened to EVE, also happened to all other robots on the ship, who altogether where a perfect system, but when an outsider came into the mix, the system didn't work anymore. An example of that are the ""roads"", that the humans aboard and robots use to move. As soon as WALL-E steps into it, he causes the probably first collision to have ever happened. The great developmental trait in regards to the Captain, and the two people WALL-E has an encounter with, is that no matter how much the human body has changed, how ignorant they are about their past, and how much they now rely on technology, all that doesn't extinguish the prime human emotion: Curiosity. It is that which brings the human protagonists to regain themselves as humans. Another non accidental detail, is the resemblance between the Autopilot and HAL-9000 of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey. They are both fundamental pieces of the ships they are built into, and have very similar personality traits: when HAL felt threatened buy the fact that the protagonists where having a conversation of him behind his back, he reacted in a very animalistic way, by trying to eliminate the threat, and when he faced his potential demise, he had a very human like reaction to it, almost as if he was feeling pain. The Autopilot reacted very similarly when he could not close the output where WALL-E would have had to place the plant, in order to put the ship en route towards Earth. He smashed the button in anger, as if it would have helped more than just pushing it. There are really no flaws in WALL-E, it is sufficiently drammatic, comical, intense and is just the right length. The animation is a thing of beauty, as are the characters, the story and the designs of the robots. Even without considering the many other meaningful themes in the story and characters, WALL-E remains to this day, and will for a long time hold it's place as one of the Giants of Cinema.","

"filipemanuelneto","1 August 2016","Wall-E is a small robot that was produced in series by the millions to clean up all the dirt that covered the planet, while the human race lived in a gigantic spaceship in orbit, fleeing to a polluted and uninhabitable planet. But now it remains only one, and he got feelings. What will happen when he falls in love? Written and directed by Andrew Stanton, this animated film from Disney / Pixar has a good cast of voice actors, headed by Ben Burtt, Elissa Knight and Jeff Garlin.For me, this is a particularly beautiful film that seeks to prove the power of love and feelings. Feelings can be so strong that even a machine, made for the most impersonal and inhuman tasks, can love. Another topic that this film deftly explores is our current waste crisis. The planet, more polluted than ever, will have a limit? Will we one day (and our planet) will no longer be able to deal with the waste we produce? And if that happens, there will be hope?The script is excellent, the story is very moving and how it develops is very fluid and natural. The quality and realism of the animation is what we expect from Pixar and Disney, two giants of animated world. It's not a movie just for kids, it will easily appeal to audiences of all ages. The voice actors were well chosen and did a good job, even though half of the film does not have any elaborate dialogue. The scenarios are excellent in both the planet and the human ship. The characters were made in interesting ways, but the ones that stand out are the robot Wall-E and Eve, who are more human than most people. The soundtrack is also very good.","

"rosco29","5 July 2008","Let's start with this: This movie made me care about a rolling trash compactor. Out of all the Pixar characters over the years, I've never felt a closer connection than I did with Wall-E. Just a simple, loyal, dutiful little 'bot and I was with him every step of the way. The emotional ties were every bit as real and moving as Jessie's ""When she loved me"" song in TS2, or Mr. & Mrs. Incredible fighting to save their family.One of the greatest tributes I have to this movie is that it kept a theater of young children ENTHRALLED. They followed everything, and paid rapt attention. Even thru the credits!This may also be the purest sci-fi film to hit the screen in ages. By all rights, it shouldn't work. Can you imagine the pitch session: ""Yeah, our hero is an electronic garbage man on a desolate, abandoned Earth, and there's almost no dialog."" If it wasn't Pixar, this movie would have never seen the light of day. But it did, and it's magic.And do ignore the clones screaming about ""thinly disguised environmental propaganda."" ""Wall-E"" is like all good fairy tales: a story that teaches us something about the angels (loyalty, sacrifice, love) and devils (gluttony, apathy) of our nature. In some aspects, Wall-E reminded me of Spirited Away. A slow-moving tale at times, but appropriately so. A family film to make you sit back and say, yeah, there's something more important than gag-a-minute writing, and bodily function humor. As others have said, this is the family film as art.Wall-E brought tears to these 44-year-old male eyes. And it made me laugh uproariously. Somewhere, Charlie Chaplin is smiling, because The Little Tramp has been reincarnated, and now he's solar-powered.Pixar has gone nine-for-nine. And just for chuckles, PRESTO, the short that precedes Wall-E, just might be the out-and-out funniest thing Pixar has ever made.Wall-E is brilliant. If you're not moved by it, check your basement. There's probably a large pod there right now.","

"dromasca","14 July 2008","Every summer lately has its big animated hit, and sometimes more than one. 'Wall-E' will certainly be the big one of the summer of 2008 and will make a lot of money in the process. I do not share the enthusiasm of the crowds on this one however.There are a few remarkable things in 'Wall-E'. The principal character is cute and nicely drawn, with an E.T. like silhouette. His romantic interest is however deprived of any charm, exception the way she voices 'Wall-Eeeeeee' and we hardly share his enthusiasm for her. The love dance in the starry night is a beautiful piece of animation. The visions of Earth reduced to a garbage dump and the one of the humanity turned into sacks of junk food are haunting, although a little too ideologically explicit. But then between all these we do expect a movie line and a story, and those are not missing but so simplistic and naive that they lack any interest for the adult viewer, and by this I mean anybody older than nine. Graphics are OK but I have seen better from Pixar.When the first viewers enthusiasm will fade out this film will slowly decrease in rating (it has by now a stellar 8.9 in IMDb, and is a neighbor of Lord of the Rings and Usual Suspects) and will melt out from Top 250. We will be left with an animated movie of a few memorable quotes but no real story to connect between them.","

Amazing writing for a truly touching next-level animation story. WALL-E was just so enjoyable and touched all of your senses with laughter and tears.

"lesleyharris30","8 July 2013","WALL-E is a great movie with another very well-developed and heartwarming storyline from Pixar and a very lovable title character.However,I do find this movie to be very overrated,it largely considered to be one of the greatest Pixar movies,it's probably one of my least favourites,I didn't find the characters as lovable as Toy Story,Monsters Inc,Incredibles,etc.It is a really great family film,but I definitely don't think it's Pixar's best and I feel the story gets a bit too serious for a children's film at times.I also didn't like how they put so much live-action bits in this movie,the musical's WALL-E watches didn't really bother me,but they should have made Fred Willard's character animated,it was just creepy seeing him in an animated movie.WALL-E is a great movie that the whole family will enjoy and it's also educational,but it's not the most entertaining Pixar movie there is.A small robot stuck alone on Earth ends up on a spaceship where the remaining population of the world are and causes a lot of drama when a plant he brings is discovered.","

"juliankennedy23","26 October 2009","Wall-E: 8 out of 10: I was never a big fan of the Short Circuit movies. It was not just the thespian outings of Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg I had issues with; I also hated the freakin robot. In addition, while I have admired some Pixar releases in the past (The Incredibles in particular), I am hardly the biggest fan of the studio and often admire some of their competition (such as DreamWorks’ Shrek) more.Therefore, I did not go into Wall-E with very high hopes. Had I known it featured the music of Hello Dolly I may never have seen it at all. After the first twenty minutes, I was blown away.I will let other reviewers explain the Chaplin style magic of the piece. Suffice it to say wow. When the movie settles into somewhat of a plot it does bog down slightly (There are at least one to many scenes of robots we do not care about chasing other robots we do not care about) but in reality it is simply a different magic.Emotionally satisfying and wonderfully subversive Wall-E is necessary viewing for adults. I am not sure if it necessarily a good film for young people with poor attention spans, but thoughtful kids will get much out of it.Moreover, kudos to Pixar for making one of the most individualistic anti-commercial films I have ever seen.","

"melwinbauer","16 December 2021","Pixar's ""Wall-E"" follows the lonely robot Wall-E, destined to roam the Earth for eternity, cleaning up the mess humans left behind. Everything changes when he meets a new friend and embarks on an adventure to save mankind.Wall-E is a wholesome animated story filled with comedy and themes of loneliness, friendship, and love. It has great potential to both create a lovable, funny, entertaining, feel-good movie for the younger audience and a deeper, interesting, and analyzable movie with a deeper meaning for the older audience. I think Wall-E capitalizes on this potential to a certain extent, but not fully. After about 30-40 minutes I believe the movie loses track of the latter and fully transforms into the animated children's movie that it is advertised to be. Fair enough, maybe that is all it wants to be, but with losing track of that it also loses out on its remaining potential and loses out on a chance to achieve real greatness.In short, despite its flaws, Wall-E is a good film filled with funny moments. It is a very wholesome experience that I would recommend.","

"bob-rutzel-1","17 January 2009","An almost intelligent robot (WALL-E) goes about his business of cleaning the earth up after an apparently devastating war. Humans are far, far away on a luxury space ship until the earth is ready to receive them again. In the meantime WALL-E encounters a female probe, EVE and is smitten. OK, let's get this out of the way: WALL-E is Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth Class. The last full length cartoon I watched was The Jungle Book and it had class, good lines and a good story. I suppose there are other good ones out there since The Jungle Book, but .. This animation cartoon had possibilities to say many things, but failed to do so, and it wasn't funny. Clever, yes, but not hilarious as some have postulated. The humans on the luxury ship were not eager to get back to earth, only the Captain was the eager one. They were happy doing what they were doing because for hundreds of years in space they knew nothing else. And, if you saw the over portly humans there would be the tendency to blame them for their physical condition, but the rigors of space did all that to them. So we are not surprised to see there were none of the reasons expounded upon to never let this happen to earth again, no more war etc etc. For hundreds of years in space they knew nothing about war and seemed to have forgotten all about living on earth. They knew nothing else. But, the Captain had an inkling. WALL-E's flight to stay with EVE as she reported back to the mother ship showed us the human condition on the luxury ship. And, that is how it all happened, boys and girls.What would have made this more interesting was to have WALL-E actually speak besides his repeating his name over and over and over and over again. He had artificial intelligence. His speaking would have gone a long way to making this a more fun movie. What made the robot in Short Circuit (great movie) so endearing was his ability to speak, exclaim, wonder, ask questions, be surprised etc. Yes, that was not WALL-E's purpose but it could have been built in by the humans so to speak, and I would have given this a better review than a mere C. I would have laughed, cried until it became a part of me. Didn't happen.Yes, the kids will like it but would have liked it better if WALL-E actually spoke. Listen to the kids if there is a sequel.Visually, this is excellent and deserves an A. Some want to put this up for an Oscar: Best Picture. Give me a break. A ""C"" doesn't beget an Oscar. Give it the Oscar for Visual Effects. Are we done now?Violence: Yes, in a cartoon kind of way. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No, although the humans almost went there","

"hellraiser7","1 November 2012","I've seen a lot of Pixar/Disney films and sci-fi in my time, and I'm proud to say that this is once again another great achievement on both counts and is another one of my favorite movies in general.The CGI animation work is just at it's best from he background details to some of the robots themselves, they all looked believably real that it's easy to forget that your even watching an animated movie.However the real power was in it's context and character we read it all mainly by what we see in the visuals since this film really doesn't have much dialog, so in a way it's almost like a silent movie but thats a great thing because form how it's handled we understand perfectly.The setting for the whole film is very dark it feels like it could happen, it's sort of a mix in tomorrows world/post apocalyptic sci-fi both in a negative satirical light though a playful sensibility at the same time. From the first half we see the earth all ruined and polluted and practically lifeless except for WALL-E and is friend a jumping cockroach. We see sky scrapers crumpled down a little, monorail trains broken down, junk and scrap left and right, atmospheric imbalance no thanks to global warming just a lot of bad left and right.To the other half of the film where of course we see all of the humans in some sort of Titanic like space craft, living there until Earth becomes habitable again; technology is most of the time running the show doing just about every little thing for them to make their lives easier. But that's the biggest problem with that ship their lives are too easy. All of the humans have simply became fat and lazy; they're all on hover chairs that do even the littlest things for them and they don't even have to movie much except press a button to give them what they want. None even eat solid food any more cause their too lazy to cook, the only way they do that is by simply drinking some sort of 711 Proteian Slurpee drink, yuck. They play sports but they don't participate in it because robots do that work for them; video game have more participation then that. But the worst part for me was seeing their mannerism where they have became somewhat docile and disconnected, yest they talk to one another but on a computer screen never directly face to face.Film does have some important underling messages from eco ethics on why we need to take better care of our enviorment. But most of all an anti consumerism and anti obesity, simply we need to take better care of ourselves we shouldn't make life too easy or we stop becoming human.However the film is a simply sweet love story/adventure. The two character WALL-E and Eve are great, I actually found myself care for them. WALL-E is sort of this mini garbage truck robot that compresses junk into cubes and stacks them like a Jenga puzzle every day to form sky scrapers. He's just such a cute and charming character from the way his body is shaped which makes him look like E.T. The way he interacts with things which has a naive childlike sensibility like with a ping pong or fire extinguisher, sounds he makes and just simple gestures which make him seem a little unsmooth but most importantly human.Same with Eve whom is a beautiful sleek advanced egg shaped robot whose mission is to explore the earth for habitability and report it, but what truly makes her great is she has a mature personality about her.The love story with the two is sweet both are sort of a strange Adam and Eve like couple since they have the earth to themselves hence the name of the robot for irony. It's actually believable because both these robots actually feel human, you can actually feel the emotion not so much from the words, both don't say much except one word their name most of the time or make certain noises which give the suggestion of certain interaction and emotion through their actions and body language. It reminds me of the Charlie Chaplin from ""City Lights"" which relied on actions but most of all was about an unlikely but beautiful pair.Fromt he first interaction which is a little unsmooth, WALL-E we see is slowly trying to get a bit close to Eve to talk but it doesn't go right at first because else is focused on business right now or just things he's a bit of a dork. But of course she does eventually let him talk to her when she feels frustration and loneliness. And of course he does win her robot heart from his funny but warm personality and charm. From showing her all the great things the world has to offer like a Rubik cube she solves in one minute, and of course the musical ""Hello Dolly"" not my favorite musical though I like a song or two from their soundtrack. My favorite moment I found romantic was when both of them fly together in space. They both kiss in a way by simply touch their heads together exchanging a small static electricity bolt. All this was just romance at it's best because it's done perfectly, even though it's between two robots it was their feelings that made their love feel very human.We saw into WALL-E and Eve's heart and soul but WALL-E and Eve saw into our own.Rating: 4 stars","

It is a shame that dialogue could not have been introduced properly between all the main characters. There is too much dependence on visual effects, insider jokes and references to fulfil the needs of multi-aged entertainment audience. A bit like going to the ballet - if only there was a little bit of drama and speech... This is not to say the film is without merit - it deserves awards for the animation and ideas alone. Unfortunately, that's all it deserves. A shame because I really wanted to say I loved this film - I didn't. It's OK....oh dear.","

"moonspinner55","21 June 2010","Disney/Pixar animation at its most beautiful, but also at its most annoying. In Earth's distant future, trash and refuse has replaced all life on the planet; a waste-reclamation robot (with human emotions and feelings) has a daily routine of condensing and piling up the junk-cubes into skyscrapers made of garbage. WALL·E is an amusing, resourceful, lovable hunk of metal and rubber who is also something of a happy hoarder (his collection includes Christmas lights, utensils, a cigarette lighter, a video-cassette of ""Hello, Dolly!"" and, most importantly, a small plant still encased in dirt). Director Andrew Stanton also co-wrote the screenplay with Jim Reardon (based on Stanton and Pete Docter's idea), and they have fashioned a mind-blowing, heart-tugging first act. WALL·E, whose only friend is a winsome little cockroach (!), is visited one day by EVE, an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, who inadvertently leads (and lifts) WALL·E off the Earth and into the galaxy (the film's peak moment) where he discovers obese, computer and soda-addicted humans living on a space station. This is arguably the moment where the movie begins losing some of its heart; Stanton shoots-up on the imaginative possibilities of the circumstance, revving the pace and sending the editing into overdrive (possibly to compensate?). There's a revolt of man-serving machines, a Captains' mutiny with the main power source, comedic elements derived from various popular films, and WALL·E's desire to be reunited with EVE (which is all we really care about). The film goes out of its way to engage younger viewers by immersing itself in cute behavior, cute responses and one-liners, and manic action-action-action. Cuteness is a prerequisite for Disney/Pixar, of course, but Stanton really lays it on thick delivering several false endings, all manipulated for that ultimate sentimental sock. Pixar Goes Green! And that's fine, if not especially amusing. The wondrous, wonderful first half-hour was still far more engaging. *** from ****","

Its animation is utterly superb, while I also like the mix of real-life footage (featuring Fred Willard as Shelby Forthright) into things.

"ymghali","4 July 2008","Stupendous. although my comment says there might be spoilers, I'll minimize talking about the events of the movie to the extent that helps prove my point of view. Pixar takes us through the short cartoon at the beginning that smartly relaxes the audience and puts them in the right mood, to a stunningly well-animated well-woven story where machines have feelings and humans have been automated. It can be described as a ""cry of warning"" about the currents human and political condition of the world. In his efforts to anticipate everything and protect life, Man has forgotten the basic principles of logic and even instincts. The political dimension isn't absented as there is a character that leaves very little room to maneuver in guessing who it is, or what it represents (let the auto pilot take over). On the other hand, a robot follows his instincts and finds a love so great that it can save humanity. Beautifully illustrated, the facial expressions and animations are amazingly illustrated, the E voices are so full of emotions that they surpass all ex-Pixar films and leave no doubt that they are The Masters. Wall E is a great work of art that has a strong message for those who want to use their heads.","

"jzappa","28 September 2008","WALL-E is an extremely accessible and emotionally touching family film that tells its story more in accordance with its medium than so many movies most older people would honestly rather see. There is something essential, fundamental, stimulating about a movie without any dialogue for its first half: It is telling its story with, guess what, images! And what magnificent images they are. They have centuries of history to them, centuries in our future. Long, long before the film opens, a megacorporation, perfectly named Buy n Large, assumed every economic use in the world, including the government, as one would think of course inevitable. Filled by unrecycled waste, the planet has been so polluted that for seven hundred years, life has been unsustainable. In an attempt to keep humanity alive, the Buy n Large CEO, played in live action on a 700-year-old city screen by Fred Willard, sponsored a five- year exodus from Earth aboard a fleet of starliners that would support every need with a robot crew. Hundreds of thousands of waste-disposal robots were left behind to clean up the planet by compacting the trash into cubes and stacking them into skyscraper-like towers for easy disposal. However, this plan was rejected when Forthright determined that Earth was too contaminated for return to ever be possible. Now, only one of these robots remains operational. That history alone makes our title character one of the most crushingly tender characters ever to be portrayed in the movies.Centuries of lingering activation have given this individual robot consciousness and a sense of interest in things. He collects centuries-old things, things that in this film's world which is so real we feel are so foreign regardless of our daily familiarity with them. This robot, WALL- E, finds them interesting among the mountains of garbage and waste, pragmatically accumulates spare parts for himself from other inactive WALL-Es, and often watches a VHS of Hello, Dolly!. As he continually watches it at the end of each day, we realize that he is developing emotion, paying particular attention to the doing of holding hands, which he deciphers to be an act of showing love. With no one with whom to hold hands, WALL-E, for the first time in centuries, feels lonely.We love this robot for the same reason we love dogs. And I do not simply mean that he is cute, but there is innocence, nobility and unconditional love projected by the cuteness. His eyes are a luminously brilliant touch: He doesn't really have a head so much as he has two steel-encased lenses upon steel stilts, and these lenses can tilt into an arch, which makes him look adorably pitiful. The little guy can draw his limbs into his body and create a cube when he senses danger or when he is resting. He experiences romance, real and powerful romance, and goes on an adventure, none of which is alluded to us any more than to WALL-E himself.What's more, as such an accessible and emotionally involving movie, it unravels into a hilarious, and quite daring, satire undertaking a direly relevant ecological agenda. There are critics who have said that it does so with a lightness of touch that allows you to accept or ignore the message. This is not true. Besides, if someone ignores the message of the film, it is not because the movie wants them to. Its confrontation with the issues it faces is evidenced by the outrage of Conservatives who have called it partisan propaganda, or that Disney and Pixar have spent millions of dollars on a film to announce an offense to its consumers. There is something noble and vital about the lengths to which society will go to telegraph the topical agenda of environmentalism.The way the movie sees it, after centuries of living in micro-gravity aboard spaceships, humans have lost significant bone mass, causing them to be too obese to stand or move without robotic assistance. Even the ship's commander, voiced by the hilarious Jeff Garlin, has entrusted all his duties to the ship's robotic autopilot, an obvious homage to HAL 9000. The unique behavior the action of the story brings aboard the ship causes the humans to act outside their standard routines, much to their delight. So the filmmakers do not necessarily see humans as inflicting the evil of mankind as some Conservative critics have claimed, but as creatures dangerously prone to routine and subjugation. Having entrusted their existence to a robotic autopilot and robotic servants and assistants of all necessary kinds, they have finally submitted themselves to the dominant power of constantly advancing technology for the sake of their own luxuries. The filmmakers do not necessarily see the toxic excess of waste to be a product of human evil, but of human lack of initiative or awareness, of the training, indoctrinating nature of constant, privileged routine.","

"sibelian","21 July 2008","WALL-E was perfect.Of course it was perfect, it's a Pixar flick! ALL Pixar flicks are perfect. They've never once even made a film that's a flawed masterpiece. They don't DO flaws.The design is fantastic. The most stunning thing is the way the robots are animated. Pixar have reached a new level in minimalism here, they hit some brilliant new peak in using the least necessary cue to signal emotion. My favourite robot is halfway through the movie. It's not so much a robot as some sort of processing unit, processing *what*, I don't know. It's attached to the wall, pushing buttons slowly and deliberately. All it has to express emotion is one big sphere for an eye and a couple of robotic arms that can barely move outside a very small and obviously highly ordered and... well, I suppose ""prescriptive"" way.It looks bored. It looks SO. BORED.WALL-E waves at it. It looks at him slowly and at it's own ""hand"", which it wiggles. ""Oh"", it thinks. Later on in the movie, as WALL-E is passing, it waves back, still bored, but just a teeny bit less so.That whole sequence for me is the best bit of the movie in terms of Pixar's artistry. I'm really glad they did it, because it goes right back to the roots of Pixar. Remember the short with the anglepoise lamps? Pixar have been showing for years that they can make the simplest of inanimate objects have dreams, adventures, failures and victories as convincingly as any other character. Robots was an obvious choice for them. I'm surprised they didn't do this movie earlier.Oh, and they've taken a leaf or two out of Studio Ghibli's book in some areas. They usually have ""out-takes"" at the end but this time there's a Ghibliesque confection that really made the point of the movie, for me.Brilliance.","

"freemantle_uk","9 July 2010","The people at Pixar are geniuses, that is a fact considering the films there have made: the Toy Story series, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., The Incredibles, Ratatouille and Up. WALL-E can join them and is one of the best amongst that list of excellent films. Pixar have a real understanding of film, know that people crave a strong story and characters that we can love. They are skilled at making films for adults and children without the need to parody or reference films and pop-culture for adults.Humanity has left Earth 700 years ago. The planet has become nothing but a wasteland after years of over-consummation and waste. Only one robot is left, WALL-E (Ben Burtt), who is cleaning up the mess in New York. After years alone he has developed a personality, he collects items of interest, his only friend is a cockroach and he continually watches the musical Hello Dolly. He longs to hold his hand with someone else. It is a sad existence. But one day another robot lands on Earth, EVE (Elissa Knight), a slick powerful robot on a mission to find plant life. After initial hostiles the two becomes and when EVE discovers that WALL-E has a plant the two are sent to the spaceship Axiom. Since humans have been in space for 700 years their bone have weaken and become morbidly obese, becoming more lazy and stupid. When the captain (Jeff Garlin) learns of this he gets excited about prospect that humans can return to Earth: but there is a conspiracy in the ship's programming to keep everyone in space. It's up to our heroes to ensure that humans return to where they rightfully belong.The writer/director Andrew Stanton knew straight away that focus of the film had to be one the film had to be on the title character. WALL-E is just such a lovable character whom loneliness which drives his need for companionship. Along with EVE Stanton was able to establish a strong relationship between the two robots with very little dialogue and a lot of facial expressions. The nature of their relationship changes throughout the film and it is basically a wonderful love story with two great characters. Stanton also creates some wonderful character designs, with WALL-E being a crude robot, whilst EVE is a really futuristic robot, with a perfectly simple and elegant look. Stanton is also ambitious, showing Earth to be dark and dirty with the blocks of rubbish joining the New York skyline to the bright, artificial world of Axiom where it is a false paradise, seeing the negative affects on the people. Stanton did also use 2001: A Space Odyssey and Alien as an influence, because of the film's grand scale, broad, epic designs, music and the fact that the computer has alternative programming. But he keeps the film fresh. Stanton too is very cleaver with small subtle details, like all the rubbish on the floor telling how this situation came about.There is a lot of humour, mostly involving slapstick, visual jokes and jokes relying on WALL-E misunderstandings. But this is not a comedy film, WALL-E is a drama and an adventure in a sci-fi context. You get to feel for the characters and at times it is a little sad. But overall it is a touching bit of entertainment for all the family.WALL-E is the Pixar film that is most open to interruption. I'm not saying other Pixar film do not have deeper meanings, it's just that WALL-E has a lot in it. There is of course the theme of environmentalism and the problems that are caused by waste and the overfill of landfills. It's an important theme that I can easily agree with. There is also other themes: one major theme is humans' over reliant on machines and that they need to do more for themselves and the fact the people have become ignorant of the world around them and loosing basic general knowledge. It is pretty thoughtful for a family film.","

"therubixtheory","21 July 2008","This film is just the animation i've been waiting to see, one that's as artistic visually as it is mentally, one that leaves you in running for tissues at the end and makes you think about the way you live your life or can send a message to the new generation.The short film at the beginning was perhaps even funnier than lifted, i wont spoil it for you but they should really have more of these before any animated film.I was starting to go that way where I thought Pixar was just all hype, their last two movies ratatouille and cars were extremely anticipated and I had problems with both, but with Rat i saw Pixar moving away from their usual ""Kiddie Flicks"" and started doing something with a little more edge.And here comes Wall-E, a film that even made me cry reading about it, and after i watched it I opened the floodgates that where my eyes.I thought the future was portrayed brilliantly, it was believable and made me a little scared of what we might become, I guess I don't really have anything else to say but this.If you don't cry at the end, whether it's over the environmental message, the vision of how technology could undo us all or the sensationally warm love story between two robots, then you weren't born with a heart inside you.","

"Vartiainen","11 August 2019","WALL·E still reigns as one of Pixar's finest films and a true testaments to the fact that you don't necessary need an overabundance of witty dialogue to tell your story. The first half of this film is practically silent, with perhaps a few lines of dialogue on the background to set the mood or to allude to the premise.The Earth has become inhospitable to human life due to our own poor choices. Mountains of garbage have buried our once great cities and we have left our home planet behind to reach for the stars. But, we've left some robots behind to clean up this mess. And one of their last remaining members is the movie's titular character, WALL·E. He's quite happy pursuing his craft, until he meets another robot, a sleeker and deadlier specimen, named EVE.What a fantastic premise and what a fantastic way to tell it. We learn everything we need to know about WALL·E without a single line of dialogue from him. Well, okay, he says his own name every now and then, and he definitely makes sounds, but they're more like bleeps and whistles. But that's all we need. His design is so amazingly expressive, so emotive, that we buy the soul behind his programming and code. His romantic spirit.That being said, if the first half of this movie is an easy A+ of storytelling, with an honourable commendation thrown in for extra measure, the latter half floats around something like a B-. Still pretty good, but it loses something when it introduces humans back into the story. When it becomes a conflict. It's still quite good, but there was uniqueness to the story before that, which I found myself missing.Still, WALL·E and EVE remain adorable throughout the entire film, it is extremely nicely animated and the message throughout the entire film is very good. It remains one of my favourite Pixar movies of all time and WALL·E himself just might be my favourite character out of the entire canon.","

"villard","5 July 2008","We've come to expect Pixar animated cartoons to be intensely funny, imaginative and adventurous from beginning to end. Despite tremendous efforts this one doesn't make it because the story warps out just when things are getting good. I'd say that for kids, going to this movie is like going to dinner where they serve the dessert first and the broccoli and cheese later. For adults, it's like spending a night at a vacation condo and getting a sales pitch on time-shares the next morning.The first 40 minutes of this film is totally adorable and very memorable. It's just extraordinarily delightful, clever, imaginative and nonstop laughs. Then it abruptly goes off the cliff with an unexplainable need to get pretentiously preachy about ""saving the planet"". This self- flagellation goes way over the heads of young viewers and doesn't do much for adults who don't need or care to see *yet another* caricature of our sloven culture.A space film with two adorably cute robot companions had tremendous potential for all kinds of fun misadventures among the stars  weird aliens, maniacal robots, lost worlds. What's more, the lack of dialog makes this film uniquely delightful, especially for kids. But as soon as the humans show up its ""wha wha wha!""Instead of going on an adventure across the galaxy, halfway through the film we are plopped down into something that looks like a cross between the Love Boat and the Mall of America. We're distracted by endless grotesque images of fat lazy humans of the 28th century. They're just stupid and very un-entertaining. They can barely take care of themselves (where's a good Morlock when you need one!). Of course they are that way because we stopped hugging trees centuries earlier and turned Earth into a junkyard of consumer waste, blah, blah, blah . . .The only scary ""bad guy"" is a failed, ineffectual take off on 2001's HAL 9000 homicidal computer. So, there is never any enthralling climatic moment of good winning over evil.""Bee Movie"" was just as obnoxiously preachy, but I didn't watch it with much of an expectation. To see Pixar fail at its consistently and wonderfully entertaining formula is heartbreaking. Did Al Gore put something in California drinking water a few years ago that compelled the cartoon animation industry to go all environmentally squishy and ""green""?I saw WALL-E in a theater full of children. I could just feel their energy drain as the film got entangled in all the confusing shenanigans aboard the space mall. This is the first Pixar film I've sat through where the audience didn't spontaneously applaud at the end (as they did in Kung Fu Panda a few weeks earlier)I'll rent a DVD of WALL-E when it comes out, only to relish seeing WALL-E and EVE playfully get to know each other again. But the moment the dumb humans and the dialog starts, it will be time to hit ""eject"" button on the DVD player. I wish cute little WALL-E had a chance to do this to the humans in this film.","

"stefanbe","29 July 2008","The average person's appreciation for animated features have grown immensely in the past seventy years since the release of Walt Disney's groundbreaking Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. However, they still retain the unfortunate tendency of being referred to as a ""children's film."" Even the most mature works from directors like Brad Bird and Hayao Miyasaki have falling into this degrading trapping. Hopefully, Andrew Stanton's follow-up to the magical Finding Nemo will dispel any idea that animation is simply made for a young audience. Wall-E is a masterpiece of epic proportion combining the talents of Andrew Stanton, the skill of Pixar's animation team and a story that feels like a collaboration between master filmmakers Charles Chaplin, Woody Allen and Stanley Kubrick. What Stanton has created with Wall-E is not simply a motion picture, it's an experience and a story that will live as long as Homer's The Odyssey, William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet and J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan. Wall-E will transcend generations and become beloved for its love story, its cautionary tale of the future and incredibly charming and relatable characters.At the start of Wall-E, The Planet Earth has been abandoned for seven hundred years as the humans await for it to be cleaned up and livable again. However, one robot is left to clean up the rubble and left-behind rubbish, a unit called Wall-E. For some many years, he has been doing the same task over and over again, accompanied only by a little cockroach. In those seven-hundred years, he has developed a personality and a curiosity for collecting various old objects. The one thing he longs for, though, is another robot to hold hands with. One day, a giant space craft lands and out of it comes a shiny new robot named Eve. Wall-E is immediately smitten with Eve and as she starts to get know him, Eve starts to grow fond of the little trash compactor. After Eve takes off again into space, Wall-E follows his dream girl-bot into space and truth about the human race is revealed.That is what happens in the first thirty minutes of the film, which is completely devoid of any human dialogue whatsoever. Wall-E and Eve communicate only in speaks and whistles, created by renowned sound designer Ben Burtt, most notably known for doing the beeps on R2-D2 from Star Wars. However, while George Lucas's creation may simply be a tin can on wheels, Stanton and Burtt have created two likable personalities with Wall-E and Eve, whose love story is the main reason for the film's success. I can say, without a doubt, that Wall-E is quite possibly the most touching and beautiful love story ever told. We feel for these characters and care for them, so whenever they're in mortal danger, we're always worried whether they will survive. I will even admit I was almost teary-eyed while watching this film. That is how powerful Wall-E is as a motion picture. The film is also very funny and touching at the same time, giving off a very Chaplin-esquire quality. The whole film definitely gives off a very City Lights vibe and I would not be surprised if Stanton was heavily influenced by that masterpiece. The most beautiful scene of the film in which Wall-E and Eve ""dance"" in space together is one that will be hard to top in any lifetime by any film released after now. The score by Thomas Newman is so incredibly superb that it almost feels like a separate character in the film and adds to how powerful the whole piece is.The social commentary is also effective and definitely makes you think more than any so-called ""intellectual Sundance release."" I would not be surprised if (at the rate people are going) Earth does end up looking the way it does in the film. China itself is already slowly heading in that direction. The humans in the film are made to look like large and cartoon-like, so as to resemble babies. What the film is saying is that humans are evolving backwards, rather than forwards. Everything needs to be done for us, much like a mother caring for her newborn and in this case, the robots are the mothers (as shown by the robot teacher in the baby school). There already are robotic vacuum cleaners where you just need to press the button and that is it. The Pixar animators and storytellers have not gone on auto-drive for Wall-E, but are putting themselves in control in where the story leads and thus why the film succeeds more than hypocritical schlock like Pokemon: The First Movie and Alvin and the Chipmunks posing as family entertainment these days. When the humans realise they must do something, they start to wake up from their bedtime naps and walk much like how babies take their first steps. I wouldn't say Wall-E is being manipulative or offensive as the film is putting a mirror up to the people, so that they understand that they do need to change their habits quickly. This film is teaching people a lesson and giving people something that your average toy advertisement will not.The Pixar team has pulled out all the stops and in effect have created their greatest achievement yet. Stanton succeeds because he puts story and characters before all else, while still providing some breathtaking animation and terrific entertainment in the process. And it is films like Wall-E that prove even more that animation is capable of anything: any genre, any emotion, any laugh.","

"drqshadow-reviews","18 September 2018","While the men are away, the machines will play. Of course, we're talking about the Earth in this case, which has been abandoned by humanity for the better part of seven centuries with mechanized drones left behind to sweep up the mess and maybe, possibly, find love somewhere in the aftermath. Wall-E's opening act is Pixar at its finest, playing with raw pantomime and rich expression during a solid forty minutes' screen time with little or no dialog.The dire, desolate setting of our planet's future is unnerving, a vast stretch of crumbling skyscrapers and wind-swept fast food wrappers, but we can't get too down in the dumps about it because the one little refuse-collecting bot at the center of it all is so deeply enamored with the place. Amidst evidence of the very worst of human nature, we're also reminded of its most redeeming qualities, and experience many of them through fresh eyes. Wall-E takes the time to appreciate things that our obsessively screen-gazing descendants miss (an uncomfortably prescient prediction, that) and, as we're along for the ride with him this time, we do, too.Spirited, fantastical sci-fi with an artist's heart and a clear message. It's ten years old, but it looks like it could've been released ten minutes ago.","

"sashank_kini-1","24 December 2008","Generally, expecting something bad from a Pixar film is close to impossible due to the fact that Pixar always has remained wonderful in its animation and Disney has backed it with a moving story. Wall-e too comes in this category at it succeeds in breaking the boundaries by enchanting us with the few amount of dialogues and more of a silent movie, which is supposed to be the condition of the cutest robot ever, Wall-e-'silent and painfully lonely'.This movie has unfathomable amount of detail and its animation is path breaking. I did not expect even such good animation from Pixar. Its even better that all their previous ventures and much better than animation of other studios.The movie's best bits are the moments on the earth which are magical.Its probably one of the best parts ever. Even after they leave the space, the movie doesn't drop its pace. Its funny, witty and loads of fun.I just wished that they remained for a longer time of Earth and they could have cut some of the space part instead. I also missed the cockroach who was so delightful that even though I find cockroaches very annoying, this one managed to capture my heart. The characters are just too good. Wall-e is so lonely and in need for company that his character manages to grab one's heart instantly. Eve too is really fine. The fat commander was really likable too. I also found the sweeper robot really funny.Overall, a great film. It surely should win Best Animated Feature of the Year. Kung Fu Panda is much lower on my ratings compared to this. 9 out of 10.","

"Tim851","7 December 2008","I didn't care much for The Incredibles, Cars or Ratatouille but Wall-E is just precious.The first half hour or so is near perfect. There is no plot line, there is nothing really happening, it's just Wall-E. And it's just too cute. This movie is connecting emotionally. Some people complain about that and the lack of, let's call it, ""solid stuff"" but hey, this is an animation film, if you expected ""The Deer Hunter"" with robots you are probably just stupid.Unfortunately (for me) Pixar too felt they needed to squeeze in a real story somewhere and they did. It's not really bad (although a bit too contemporary) and it's rather well executed but it totally contrasts the first half hour and I feel it would've done much better without it.But nonetheless, it's still a 9/10. It's safe to say that people who thought ""Boo"" was the best thing about Monters Inc. will love Wall-E, everybody who thought that movie had a great and enticing plot probably won't.","

"commandercool88","7 July 2008","Some time ago, I stumbled across the new rumblings of Pixar's next film, 'Wall-E'. And as I read through a story detailing a planet that could no longer sustain human life, and a cute little robot who held the weight of the world on his shoulders, a thought dawned on me. That if Pixar did good on their initial proposal, they could open a door of epic opportunity. That if they took a chance and held nothing back, they could make a film that wouldn't simply entertain audiences, but instill change.Pixar has now released their brainchild for the world to see and judge, and the film that I hoped would carry a thoroughly spine-chilling message has done more than just deliver an environmentally friendly message. Many times I sat in awe, choking back tears as I watched a monumentally beautiful story unfold before my eyes. Change. Hope. That's what 'Wall-E' is. Pixar has created a masterpiece, and I don't say that lightly. Like a swift kick in the gut, 'Wall-E' is not only a revolutionary love story but a wake-up call to a world that may not be too far away the one 'Wall-E' so tragically portrays.Welcome to the future. Welcome to Earth. Welcome to a world where pollution clouds the skies and the landscape is little more than a staggering garbage heap. Welcome to a world where a wholesale retail giant has taken over, its CEO now Earth's global president. A president who at one point utters the now reproachable phrase, 'stay the coarse'. But more importantly, welcome to a world without human life. A world so far gone, human's deserted it for a space station long, long ago. Earth, a memory.'Wall-E' doesn't merely criticize our way of life. It doesn't simply frown on our increasing dependence on technology, our desire to make daily routines as effortless as possible. It doesn't wag a finger at our sky-rocketing obesity rates and a mounting detachment to human interaction and the world around us. No, 'Wall-E' effectively slams our very way of life. 'Wall-E' sums up the future of humanity, and it's one of the most shocking visions of the future to ever touch the screen. It is a film whose implications are severe and utterly devastating, a cry to the world to not just sit around and do nothing, a cry to the world to not simply survive but to live. An urgent message that has to be heard and acted upon.But when all seems to be lost, 'Wall-E' reminds us that hope never dies. And as long as our will power is strong, there is a way. There's no denying Pixar's natural talent, because they've done it again. Through its powerful and vastly important message, 'Wall-E' is a space odyssey for the new millennium, and a love story for the ages. Who else could create such an adorable robot and so effectively grant him human characteristics, and above all else, the ability to love. Perhaps the most basic of human instincts, the desire to love and be loved in return. And as this devastatingly cute trash-compacting robot travels the universe for Eve, the object of his affection, we're witnessing one of the grandest and most eloquent stories ever told.'Wall-E' is a film that may very well be studied for years to come. Parents who take their children to see this may be taken completely off-guard to find that 'Wall-E' isn't just a light piece of kiddie entertainment, it's a sweepingly beautiful and historic film. One can only hope that people who see it will listen, and take with them a new outlook on life and the future of this planet. It's a stinging bite from Pixar, but a timely one. Without a doubt their boldest move yet, and one that will be remembered as long cinema has an audience. A legacy of forever.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public","

"departed07","12 March 2009","Just days after the 2008 Academy Awards announced the winners, I had to see the best animation feature winner ""Wall-E"" in which all of my young cousins and nieces and their parents have seen this film and commented on it being wonderful making me the outcast of the bunch.""Wall-E"" takes place in the distant future where Earth has been destroyed due to the lack of care the people never gave into cleaning the trash making it a pile of ruins. All is left on Earth besides empty stores is a pile of junk rubble made into cubicles and set into buildings while a robot named Wall-E tries to make his ""Earth"" the way it was before the human population became extinct. There are no other creatures or animals with the exception of a cockroach that Wall-E considers a companion where the robot uses an abandon ship as his home filled with various toys and devices; the small robot uses an I-pod to watch a musical in which Wall-E tries to emulate the scene.Later in the film, another robot named EVE enters the absent Earth where Wall-E finds contact of his kind for the first time after years of being isolated that he tries his best to win her heart. Even though their only way of communication is by saying their names to one another along with certain one words, the two robots share a relationship where I had tears and a smile on my face. But what Wall-E doesn't know is that EVE was sent to look for a living organism (a plant) and sent it back to space to show that there is life on Earth. So Wall-E follows EVE to space with their adventure just beginning.""Wall-E"" is something for everybody. It may be a Pixar movie for kids and Disney fans to watch, but there's more to this film than just a kids movie or a Disney film. The film is everything for sci-fi fans to talk about, those who care for the environment (a later subplot in the film), or yet, those who love watching romantic movies where Wall-E and EVE are the first screen couple that aren't human and yet, I really felt an attraction to them as I cried during their scenes.It's that good and so wonderful that it should have deserved the best picture nomination.","

"Mysterygeneration","24 December 2021","I'm concerned about WALL-E. This is a film that is, in a word, flawless. This is another instant classic in the same vein as Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, and Ratatouille. The picture is a rousing testimonial to the enduring power of love, as well as an ethereally timeless marvel. Wall-E is a nearly silent story about the world's last working robot falling in love with a more advanced metal visitor.While there are a few exciting action sequences, the most of the film's most dramatic and moving moments are absolutely silent. This film discusses global warming while also addressing our persistent collective indifference to it.","

With the weakest being CARS, witch still was a good movie (just not perfection/near perfection like the rest) could there reputation hold up to the next movie.Do we need oxygen to live? I can't think of a bad part in this movie. There are some scientific errors beyond basic sci-fi, but the movie is good enough to look past them. The little dialog beyond some robot designating things such as ""Target"" or ""Foreign substance"" and a few commercials. One particular thing I enjoyed was when a space craft was passing the moon, you could see the Armstrong landing sight. Next to it was an add for a BUY-N-LARGE superstore.The animation was flawless. If I was looking at the images minus the people and some robots (not all however)I would swear it was live action.The sounds are going to win an Oscar. The music will be nominated (though I doubt it will win) I really doubt any movie will beat this for best animated feature film 2008. I wouldn't be surprised if it got nominated for best screenplay.

From the opening star-scape with ""Put on Your Sunday Clothes"" playing cheerily in the background, to the closing credits, this movie is in an utter masterpiece. There's never a dull moment in this beautiful film. The audience is taken through such a vast range of emotions, ranging from the pure joy of discovery, to the near-hopeless sense of defeat. Director Andrew Stanton has done it again, adding WALL-E on top of his previous Pixar success, Finding Nemo. Nemo was originally my favorite Pixar film.

"KrazzyDJ","3 January 2010","I had heard about this film since quite a long time. My first thought was that could an ""Animation"" film supposedly created for kids work as a science-fiction movie for me ? After realizing the positive reception that this film had garnered, I decided to watch this. It would be a first for me in the sense that this was the first animated feature film that I would be viewing. And now, after having done that, I'm glad that I stepped into the territory of animation. WALL·E is not just a fun-filled animation movie meant for kids. It is at par with any feature film featuring big stars, sets and budgets ever made and is much better than most of them.The story is mainly told through visuals (although quite a bit of dialog creeps in during the last hour) and is best deciphered by the viewers themselves instead of being explained in such a review. It's set about 700-800 years into the future when Earth is in a mess, mankind has settled into space and the only moving thing left on Earth is a robot named WALL·E - this should more than suffice. Although there are no dialogs for a major portion of the film, it is much simpler to understand yet gets more complex as you start analyzing it in detail. This kind of treatment comes across as far more effective (at least for me) than say the one in 2001: A Space Odyssey which relies heavily on visuals leaving almost all of the deciphering to the viewer. As such, WALL·E is as simple or complex as you perceive it to be (although for the most part, it is the former).Despite having a short running time, the film packs in much more than many 2+ hour extravaganzas and credit for this must go to the writing, direction and editing - all absolutely first rate. The screenplay is packed in with twists and turns that rarely do we come across moments where nothing happens on screen. Some people have criticized as the opening minutes of the film boring - WALL·E apparently simply goes about doing his stuff. But according to me, those sequences do exactly what they're meant to do - they not only provide us with a glimpse of the everyday life of WALL·E (which is boring and mundane) but also gives an insight into WALL·E's loneliness as also the fact that he longs for companionship. The editing is flawless and one scene just flows into the next (many scenes spring up a surprise or two as well).Technically the film looks polished and the first twenty minutes will leave you wondering whether you're indeed watching an animation film or a shot live-action one. It's only when the humans enter the picture that you realize that its animation. The lighting in the future earth sequences is so live-action Esq, it makes those sequences all the more appealing. Just looking at the principal characters, you can see that it has taken a lot of effort.The main reason that the film works (for me at least) on such a huge level is (besides the story and treatment) is the main character WALL·E. He is simply put the perfect representation of an endearing, hard-working, polite yet cute robot representing humility and empathy. And his eyes are probably his best feature - they are so expressive that WALL·E doesn't need the mouth, shoulders, or even words to communicate or express the emotions that he goes through - the eyes say it all. In short he is the star of the film.WALL·E works on any and every level you want it to. What then is disappointing about this film ? Not much except that I was really looking forward to the music in the trailers being a part of the film and was heartbroken to find out that it wasn't. Also, the future humans could have been a bit better - they look far too cartoonish especially when compared to the film's look in the earth sequences. I guess I've become used to complaining which is what makes me feel as if something's missing from a movie. On the positive side, I believe this prevents me from rating a movie 10/10 at the drop of a hat. Nevertheless, these complaints do not take away from the fact that WALL·E is, in almost all aspects, a superior film and should not just be dismissed as an animation film meant for kids - it has a good message hidden inside it. And yes, this film has allowed me to open the doors of my mind to a new genre of movies - animated films. For me, Toy Story's next.Score: 8.7/10 (Rounded off to 9/10)","

"chrombot","27 June 2008","No problem! Finally an animated movie that dares to be.... animated! Pixar has set a new standard in digital animation. I say digital, because I'd still like to see more traditional hand drawn films. You don't need recognizable voices coming out of animals that resemble them. You don't need cheesy jokes or failed one liners. No musical cues to band either. I don't think I'll be able to watch a computer animated movie for a long time, I'll compare to this for a while. Pixar was not in this for the cheap quick cash in, they made a movie, that I think, will stand the test of time. I can tell people will be watching this for years and years, like Fantasia.","

"invisibleunicornninja","7 April 2018","This movie is almost perfect. The story, animation, message, and characters are all amazing. My only complaint is that though the majority of this story is told visually, there is a dialogue-heavy intro that was pretty unnecessary. Otherwise, this movie is amazing and I would highly recommend it.","

"thekarmicnomad","17 August 2008","This film is amazing. Pixar just keep pulling them out a dark nasty piece of me wants to see them fail just once. Yet despite bringing out films about cooking rats and robots that can't speak they seem unable to.PLOT The plot is simple so small children can understand it without having to ask you too many annoying question, yet the underlying story is powerful enough to keep adults hooked. Walle can't really speak but he never actually needs too, there is a little bit of narration through TV screens but the story tells itself.ANIMATION OK it is really great and all done by a super computer. clap clap. But what is really amazing is how much personality is infused into the characters. Also it looks genuinely funny there is a scene near the end where my partner and me were creasing up with laughter.DETAIL There is so much detail in the film it is unbelievable. Look around the edges of the screen and you can see tiny pieces of background and details that you are only consciously aware of if you really hunt for them. The opening sequence is a master piece, I could watch it all day long.I saw it in the cinema all the kids were gripped and laughing, I genuinely felt a bit teary in places and cannot recommend this enough.My first ever 10 goes to a cartoon, who would have guessed?","

That Wall-E contains several such moments is a testament to the continuing brilliance of Pixar.The story is a simple one but the execution is breathtaking. It is ironic that the most genuine characters to emerge from a movie in years are in fact computer generated robots. Without saying more than two words to each other WALL-E and EVE convey subject and emotion with a subtlety that only serves to enhance the meaning.Watch this movie and revel in its majesty.","

"elicopperman","17 June 2018","10 years ago, Pixar released Wall-E, which started development as far back as 1995 when Toy Story was released, but was never put into full production until 2002 by Andre Stanton. What followed was a movie going experience unlike any other Pixar venture ever before crafted due to the raw emotions and intellectual philosophies it contains. While Ratatouille still remains my personal favorite Pixar film, there is no denying how brilliant Wall-E is from start to finish. Imagine what would happen if ""Walt Disney, Charlie Chaplin, Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg decided to collaborate on a movie together"" (Stefan Ellison).For starters, what makes Wall-E stand out from many animated films is its usage of visual storytelling. As it centers around two distinct robots, one named Wall-E from a trash ridden Earth and one named Eve from a maximum spaceship, they mainly communicate with vocal effects and bleeps. This is the perfect representation for animation, as the first ten minutes establishes Wall-E and its position on a deserted wasteland to an understandable degree to the audience. As the old saying goes, actions speak louder than words, and it's fantastic how Wall-E's interests and interactions with the environments around it tell more than any amount of dialogue ever could.Speaking of vocals and lack of dialogue, most of the robot sound effects were provided by former Star Wars sfx technician Ben Burtt. Burtt doesn't simply create mechanical beeps, he creates multiple vocal ranges and sounds that define each robot depending on what they're conveying, let alone Wall-E. Another cool touch was having the Apple product MacInTalk to be the voice of Auto, as it emulates its artificial intelligent presence throughout the film. There are of course other noteworthy voice actors like Jeff Garlin, John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy and even Sigourney Weaver, but as good as they are, none of their contributions will ever live up to the specific sounds for each robot that make them come off as more than just interactive machines.At its core, Wall-E is a love story, and the progression of Eve feeling uncomfortable around Wall-E to soon falling in love with it transitions believably throughout the feature. This is because Wall-E never directly forces its feelings towards her and mainly wants to have a friend to no longer feel alone. Even though Eve was initially designed to be ""directive"", she does develop outside her duty upon seeing the positive qualities of Wall-E and the Earth itself. Not to mention, despite Wall-E's attempts to approach her romantically not growing outside of Hello Dolly, the scenes of it taking care of her or following her around come off as charming due to its unselfish attitude. It isn't until she views footage of Wall-E taking care of her that she decides she loves him back, making her arch all the more touching.Now the one aspect of the film that has been debated ever since its release is its social commentary, mainly the environmental message depicted in the conflict between idealism and capitalism in the Axiom spaceship. The main reason the humans can't leave the ship is because of a massive government corporation taking control of the world. A plant that Wall-E and Eve discover hightens the environmental message to remind the humans to take care of the Earth, yet it does not come off as preachy and instead works as a major goal. While Wall-E initially came aboard the Axiom to save Eve, it discovers the bare necessities in how effective the plant is to humans, making it more determined than ever to save them. The main reason the humans are so infatuated with their own technology is because they've become too careless to do anything else, something unfortunately common in today's era of social media dominating people's lives. However, the film at no point ever mocks the humans and instead sympathizes with them, down to Captain McCrea giving orders all the time by his auto pilot for no other reason other than his naivety. Even two humans aboard the Axiom named John and Mary come face to face in romance thanks to Wall-E himself, showing how the unlikeliest of coincidences can be more meaningful than everyday occurrences. However, what I like most about Wall-E is how optimistic it is, as it shows a genuine love and respect towards planet Earth through the simplest of things, hence why Wall-E itself finds so much joy in stacking up cubes of trash. In addition, Captain McCrea represents the best kind of optimist, the ones that are highly determined to save their own life based off the smallest form of natural evolution, while Auto represents the pessimists who refuse to believe that anything can bring a positive change to the world. Seriously, there are plenty of people out there who only live and breath on nothing but pessimistic thoughts, and they'll also try to manipulate you into believing their ideas, regardless if you have your own feelings or not. This makes the moments of McCrea and Wall-E standing up for what's right all the more captivating, showing how positivity and hope helps one more than negativity ever will.Finally, the animation is stellar beyond belief, mainly because of how experimental it is. The acting from Wall-E and Eve is quite clever, given how the crew chose Wall-E to have binoculars for eyes, which convey all its emotions and outer thoughts beautifully. Eve's various eye expressions are also enough to sell herself as a fully realized character. The depiction of outer space is gorgeous to the eyes, and the define dancing sequence just might be one of cinema's greatest moments due to the stunning effects and crisp flying scenes. The usage of color is a notable highlight, especially the contrast between the brownish and grainy wasteland of the world and the Axiom's blueish sterile interiors, creating an identity for each area the film takes place in. The camerawork is also fun to watch, given the influence of 1970s cinematography, swooping crane shots, and even the camera going in and out of focus, all of which to help bring us into the world much more.In conclusion, after ten years of existence, Wall-E still stands the test of time as one of the most magical, touching and downright brilliant films ever made. As both a major game changer for the sci-fi genre and an adorable romance story, it succeeds in flying colors with its unique take on storytelling, characterization, and themes of fundamentalism vs cynicism. No joke, if we had more beings like Wall-E in our lives, chances are the world would be a much better place, and it all starts by shining hope around the world, let alone with plants. Thank you to not only director Andrew Stanton, but also the likes of Jim Morris, Pete Docter, Jim Reardon, Ben Burtt and all the talented animators, artists and technicians at Pixar for bringing his movie into our lives. Even after 700 years, there's a high chance that audiences will still be immersed and enchanted by its wonderful story and characters.","

"ValleyOfScarletFever","24 February 2010","I really had no idea what to make of the new Disney/Pixar movie ""WALL-E"". I mean, I heard great reviews of the movie, claiming it was ""The definite best animated picture Oscar"" or even ""best picture worthy"". I seriously doubted this. At the same time, I heard people say that it was ""overpreachy garbage"", or ""Pixar rubbish spewed at us again by the marketing advertisers at Disney"". I also highly doubted this. I heard that it was lighthearted, yet at the same time really depressing. In short, I had no idea how this movie would be.Oh dear.So, I came in the movie with a pretty open mind, yet still skeptical. The last few Pixar movies, with an exception to ""Ratatoullie"", haven't been that great. I was worried that ""WALL-E"" would have been over-hyped, and that it wasn't really all that great.I was wonderfully mistaken.First off, I'd like to say that the opening short was great. Not good- great. It was funny, witty, and flat out cute. Just wanted to say that.So, I've heard many people saying that the opening was artsy. I'd have to say I'd disagree. It wasn't artsy- it was a representation of WALL-E's life. It had a few sight gags that will entertain the kiddies, yet at the same time was pretty emotional. It opens on a ruined and not green Earth, yet in the background plays music from ""Hello Dolly"". But after that amazing opening, we finally get to the story.EVE arrives. Immediately, WALL-E (unsurprisingly) is enamored with her. (Even though she keeps trying to shoot him with her laser.) There is a cute little montage with WALL-E wanting desperately to hold her hand, a very sweet theme throughout the movie. The movie hits off with WALL-E trying to show EVE the ""wonders"" of his Earth, and meanwhile he shows her the last remaining plant that he found. THIS is when the movie begins.WALL-E and EVE get trapped on this Space Cruise, which has been going on for about 700 years. In other words, all of the people are all fat and ugly and lazy. But they're so lovable! Again, this moment could come off as preachy, but it doesn't, and moves quite smoothly. There are also many funny robots doing- well, funny things. Getting back to the plot, pretty much the plant that WALL-E finds and EVE gets becomes the center plot, proving that life is capable on Earth- but it's not as easy to get back as it sounds. It becomes somewhat of an action type movie, with comedy, and a little romance. I can't say anymore because it'll give too much of the plot away, but let's just say I got a little teary eyed.I would recommend this movie to all ages, but really I'd say 6 and up. I mean, not saying that little kids won't like it, they just might find it boring after a while, and might hunger for something with a little more in your face comedy, more of a ""Toy Story"" or ""Monster's INC"". In other words, it's not a ""kiddie flic"", but rather a ""family movie."" I still don't like the product placements for this movie every five minutes, but at least the message wasn't IN YOUR FACE obvious. It was subtle, which was nice.In all, I'd say that this was a really good movie and would recommend it. (Oh yeah, the animation was beautiful. Just wanted to add that.) Rating: A Age Group: Any age (but recommended 6 and up).Comparison to other Pixar films: It's different, but good.Overall: A great movie.","

"dforster","10 July 2008","I decided to add my voice because this film is highly rated and I have never found myself at such odds with the majority of the IMDb audience.Spoiler at end.I read enough to see that I have nothing to add concerning its technical achievement, obviously well done.I am an avid science fiction fan (books and film) so I agree with those who find this story weak. I went because I wanted to know why this film was so highly rated across all the demographic areas although I had my doubts based on the preview.Apparently many do not agree with me but I would like to caution others that if you look forward to thought provoking ideas and having your preconceived notions challenged you will be disappointed. Even younger audiences may become bored after 1/2 hour although the visual stimulation may be sufficient.My background includes special effects in film and computer program development so I naturally appreciate the films technical prowess. But I also know well almost all the science fiction films made to date including those with serious as well as comic presentations and WALL-E does not rate well for me when compared to them.WALL_E missed being sufficiently provocative or amusing so I found it bland. The film, however, was much better portraying the emotional connections between the two main characters which is quite an achievement considering WALL-E was a garbage disposal unit who apparently developed over a long period of time a more than human heart (think of your feelings for roaches).Spoiler follows: The ideas of planet ruin via garbage and humans becoming fat, technologically catered to, isolated in space, and thus unmotivated beings after 700 years is interesting but each of these is not original and I, at this time, cannot clearly describe why the film failed to engage me. Perhaps with such a future there should be more angst.","

"oneguyrambling","29 November 2010","In the distant future a garbage compactor robot named Wall-E has his cosy existence changed upon the arrival of another robot seeking evidence of life...A brilliant creation given that the first 30 odd minutes contain practically no dialogue, and that basically a robot and a cockroach share top billing.Wall-E isn't your standard Pixar headliner. He isn't that cute, doesn't have a catchphrase and can only talk in short limited syllables pushed together to make awkward words or short phrases at best. But he is totally dogged and won't be deterred from his task once he decides on what he needs to do.Humans come across as even lazier, fatter and more useless than most of us are. In fact apparently lying on the couch will eventually cause our bones to more or less melt, and we will become giant fleshy beanbags for whom our universe doesn't extend beyond the TV screen in front of us. On second thought maybe this isn't too far away...In truth Wall-E might be the hardest film on this list for a young'un to concentrate on, given that it really is a silent film for long spans, and the plot isn't really spelt out for younger minds.What you hope kids will learn: You don't necessarily have to be alive to have life.What they'll take away: Sometimes I wonder if humans really are the top of the food chain.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com","

However, in the remainder of the movie, the animation got in the way of the story. The animation was stunning, but it was also distracting. In Ratatouille and Toy Story 2, the story drove the movie, and although the animation was great, it wasn't so overwhelming that it interfered.I recently took my granddaughter to see Kung Fu Panda, which was not as well animated but overall was much more enjoyable. The greatness of the animation can detract from the greatness of the movie.","

The animation is top-notch, the story is heartwarming, and the characters are some of the most lovable robots to grace the silver screen.

The characters are likable as well even the chemistry between WALL-E and Eva are so cute and heartwarming it would leave a bit teary-eyed. The villain is pretty cool too with a robotic voice so menacing and several of the other characters including the captain of the Axiom are also good. The pacing moves along really well and the animation is fantastic with a futuristic setting which gives the movie a great atmosphere to it.Overall, WALL-E is another Pixar masterpiece that will always be worth-watching.

"tnrcooper","2 August 2008","This is a great, great movie. This should be a lesson to the studios and their pre-packaged bilge that verbose and/or run-of-the-mill films should not be made. Put more resources into doing something well, like ""Wall-E"" and you will be rewarded.....to paraphrase from ""Field of Dreams"" - ""if you make it, they will come."" Be willing to take a chance and you might well come up with a gem of a film like this. This is the story of computer Wall-E, set many years in the future, perhaps the last functioning being in the United States after Earthlings have been forced to take refuge in a spaceship run by mega-company Big 'n' Large (think Wal-mart). It would appear that at the time that the ship left Earth, apparently having extracted all value from anything in New York, Big 'n' Large (BNL) was running (at least) New York City. As the film progresses we see messages filmed by the BNL CEO (played wistfully by Fred Willard) around the time New York City became uninhabitable, informing the residents of New York that the BNL ship would be taking off and that it was the best way for them to survive. This provides us with the backstory as to why the residents of the BNL ship are where they are. The film takes place in the 29th century as the last residents of Earth cross the universe in this ship, their lives on-board the ship exceedingly mundane and boring. They criss-cross the massive ship in orderly lines in little pods taking them from one dull thing to another. It seems they spend a lot of time lounging in huge open plazas, choosing and consuming items that can be purchased via individualized interactive headsets. People seem de-sensitized and bored, which is not surprising given they seem to be touring space seemingly without purpose or point. All of this is beautifully rendered by the Pixar artists. The images of the people and machines roaming the ship are gorgeous and imaginative. One of the surest signs that the Pixar artists are at the top of their game is that they render huge assemblies in the finest detail, depicting thousands of little beings in the most realistic manner, with no diminution of quality in spite of the large number of beings they have to depict. These huge meetings are awe-inspiring and remind me of some of the best animation depicting massive assemblies in ""Antz"".Meantime, back on Earth, Wall-E, apparently the last functioning creature in NYC, fulfills his purpose by organizing all of the discarded junk into massive piles. One of the most enjoyable elements of the film to me, was the manner in which Wall-E employed various items of our modern life in his existence. For instance, a videotape of a modern film was operated by an iPod. Also, Wall-E taped things he found interesting, using a cassette player. When his battery got low, the signal that it was re-charged was the ubiquitous Apple chime which one hears when an Apple computer is turned on. Wall-E methodically and systematically organizes piles and piles of junk, making instantly recognizable junk into large columns by which to impose some semblance of order on his environment. His life is quite dull and mundane. However, this changes one day when a robot named Eve from another ship lands on earth, seeking signs of life. Wall-E falls in love with her and when she is ordered back to her ship, he wants to return with her.From this simple premise comes the whole film. There is not much a lot of dialogue in the film, particularly during the first half, and very few actors involved-among them Jeff Garlin of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" as the bored but intrigued captain of the BNL ship, Sigourney Weaver as the Hal-like robot on the BNL, and a few others. In spite of the paucity of dialogue, Wall- E's affection for Eve is communicated very clearly, their determination to communicate convincingly with the Hal-like robot is communicated with ease, and the malaise which seems to afflict the occupants of the BNL is also expressed without much verbal communication. Perhaps most impressively, we get an appreciation of how much Wall-E enjoys and is interested in finding things which we the audience recognize. He makes only perfunctory, mechanical sounds, but the talented people at Pixar, under the direction of Andrew Stanton who also helped write the scripts to ""Toy Story II"", ""Finding Nemo"", and ""Monsters Inc"", are able to convey the full range of emotions which humans-and in the 29th century, apparently robots-feel. This is a joyous, special film in which one is reminded of the reasons why life and all our opportunities should be cherished. The fact that it captures the breadth of expression and feeling which we as humans experience, as well as the pioneering, creative animation, makes it an acceptable film selection for kids and for adults.","

"jfrorie","25 June 2008","I saw Wall-E at a special sneak preview. I'm not a Pixar fanboy. I've enjoyed a number of their movies, but this is first I've seen at the theater.Wall*e was an enjoyable diversion. The titular character is robot that has spent his many days performing his task in isolation. All the other robots have worn out over time. Wall*e is different in that he is a survivor. In the many years he has worked, he has evolved a sense of self. Unfortunately, that involves a feeling of loneliness. After a significant event, it is resolving this loneliness that becomes his quest.The stars of the shows are the various robots. Their emotions are inferred through their actions, grunts, clicks and the occasional verbalization. This however is not a limitation. Pixar has created characters you care about. Wall*e is a hero in the tradition of Danny Kaye. He is a simple guy with simple ambitions that just happen to coincide with the events in the movie. He isn't glory seeking, he just wants companionship in the sappiest Disney tradition. It is this purity of soul that is his most endearing quality.This more of a kid's film that past Pixar efforts and the hand of Disney is firmly felt. There are sweeping scenes that designed to evoke adolescent dreams and emotions. That is not to say adults won't find it enjoyable. Pixar takes shot at a couple of themes; Consumerism, the environment, even some mild political humor. There are even a couple of gags relating to cockroaches and Twinkies which have oft been repeated. However, it lacks some of the sly adult wit that some of the previous films had.There little highbrow comedy here. Most of the gags come from slapstick pratfalls and such. However, the gags are executed with such precision, and the characters are so compelling that they were very effective. The rest of the humor consists of sight gags. Most not rising to the point past a chuckle, but taken as whole weaves a rich tapestry of the world that Wall-E lives in.Adults will find it enjoyable. Kids will love it beyond words and you're going to have to buy them Wall-E dolls for Christmas.","

"jdkraus","5 July 2008","There are many reasons why I like this movie. For starters, the animation is absolutely amazing. ""Toy Story"" may have begun the 3-d animation genre, ""Finding Nemo"" may have added more details in the scenery, and ""The Incredibles"" may have introduced the retro looking characters. But ""Walle"" brings a whole new look at animation. It took only the opening sequence shots of space and the acceleration towards a dusty, abandoned, futuristic, and trashed earth to make me say ""Wow"" on how good its animation quality is. The second thing I like about this movie is the characters. Walle, a lonely and curious robot does not say much, but he easily makes a lovable character. His friend and later sidekick Eva is likewise a fun character. It amazes me that it doesn't take a lot of dialog to make enjoyable characters. What was so interesting about these two machines is the friendship and the length they are willing to go to save one another as well as the humans from a total apathetic state. This then leads to the third reason why I like this film, the plot. It may sound too corny or even far from the truth that 800 years from now, we would be living space. However, much of what the social situation that the humans live in is very close to home, for instance: 1.) The earth being a total waste by the lack of care for the environment, by pollution and improper waste disposals. 2.) The humans overweight (with fast food styled meals), busy talking to one another on their screens, and floating in portable chairs. 3.) The heavy reliance on technology and computers rather than doing it ourselves.Does any of this ring a bell? It sounds like us doesn't? Who knows what can happen in 800 or even 10 years. The film is great entertainment with also a grand message. No doubt that ""Walle"" will win the Best Animated Film Award for next year's Oscars. It could also very well be nominated or even win for Ben Burtt's wonderful sound and sound effects editing used for all the machines and other characters. I also hope that Thomas Newman gets a win for his wonderful score that sets the emotions in such an excellent movie. 10/10","

"meeza","30 June 2008","""Wall-E"" is ""by far out"" the best Pixar computer-animated film ever assembled. OK, it might sound fishy to you that I am selecting ""Wall-E"" over ""Finding Nemo"". You might think I am a rat in the kitchen by selecting ""Wall-E"" over ""Ratatouille"". You might think I am toying with you by selecting ""Wall-E"" over ""Toy Story 1 & 2"". You might think that I am incredibly deranged by selecting ""Wall-E"" over ""The Incredibles"". And you might think it is monstrous of me to select ""Wall-E"" over ""Monsters, Inc"". All the aforementioned are obviously credible computer-animated Pixar creations, but none of them captured the intellectual seismic force of ""Wall-E"". This earth trash shattering robot is definitely the most appealing character graphically drawn up by the Pixars. ""Wall-E"" stands for ""Waiting Amazingly Long Lines- Exasperatedly"", No! It actually stands for ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class"". Wall-E is a small waste collecting robot who is in a solitude futuristic earth with just a tiny pet cockroach to keep him company. However, Wall-E is not a total waste because he is very ingenious in doing the garbage work in a very compacting and useful manner. Wall-E is primarily a love robot who craves for the robotic touch of a Mrs. Roboto. Before you can say ""Hello Dolly"" (which is the film Wall-E constantly sees in his trashy apartment, lol) he falls for a female robotette named Eve which has traveled to earth to evaluate living organisms. Wall-E and Eve fall in love and then Wall-E eats a devilish apple which then (Wait! Wrong Eve story here). OK, here we go: Wall-E eventually follows Eve into a grandeur spaceship which takes him out of the earth-lands. In the second chapter of ""Wall-E"", the film turns into an insightful environmental lesson on the futuristic fate of our universe via Wall-E's hilarious, passionate, romantic, generous, and heroic ""space cadet"" spaceship adventures. Director Andrew Stanton brilliantly provides homage to Stanley Kubrick's classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" by inserting elements of the Odyssey into ""Wall-E""; i.e. Blue Danube space, a similar HAL villain, the fate of mankind, etc. Somewhere in ""Stanton Island"" there is a Stanley Kubrick Memorial! There is not much dialogue in ""Wall-E"", but I must verbalize that it was the way to go in the ""Wall-E"" tale since it is Stanton's marvelous directorial orchestration that is the primary presentation tool of ""Wall-E"". It would be a waste if Stanton is not nominated for a Best Director Oscar nomination! ""Wall-E"" is the love guru that you should really be watching this summer! ""Wall-E"" will not be a waste of your time! One of the best films of 2008! I am not being off the wall when I say that ""Wall-E"" is so far one of the best films of 2008! Take off and see it today! ***** Excellent","

"virek213","6 May 2011","Disney/Pixar has consistently outdone itself in every movie it has released since its collaborative history began in the mid-1990s: TOY STORY; CARS; RATATOUILLE; and FINDING NEMO, to name just a few. But in 2008, they really outdid themselves by creating a storyline set in the far future, in which the very existence of Earth and humanity itself rest in the hands of an unlikely hero. That unlikely hero was WALL-E; and his adventure, when it burst onto the big screen that summer resulted in an enormous box office windfall for Disney/Pixar totaling close to $600 million, plus a well-deserved Oscar for Best Animated Film.The titular character of the piece is, for all intents and purposes, a squat trash compactor, whose name WALL-E stands for Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth Class. His job, as has been the case for 700 years, is to clean up the mess that humanity left behind on Earth, compacting various bits of trash into cubes, and whiling away his spare time with a cockroach and a surviving VHS copy of the 1968 film musical HELLO DOLLY. Wall-E, however, has also gained a sense of of self-awareness and insatiable human curiosity, as can be seen by his consistently wan expression; and when he sees a small sprout of a plant poking up from underneath an otherwise polluted ground, he senses a change in the air. He is then visited upon by a female robot called EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, who), upon learning of the existence of the plant in Wall-E's possession, takes both it and Wall-E up to the intergalactic cruise ship ""Axiom"", now in its 700th year of existence, to prove that life on Earth is coming back.All of this, of course, is new to Wall-E, as are some fairly disturbing things, like the non-stop consumption of the passengers, fed to them by the same mega-conglomerate, Buy N Large (BNL) that fatally polluted Earth, and their morbid obesity; and the conflict between the ship's captain and the on-board computer named Auto, whose red eye is so much like HAL in director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. With Eve's help, however, and after many wacky misadventures, Wall-E helps the captain retake control of the ship, and steer it back towards Earth once the existence of the little plant becomes fact. In the meantime, Eve and Wall-E begin an electronic love affair that has been building from that first portentous meeting.The swath of digital animation films to come from Disney/Pixar has been nothing short of amazing, but they definitely outdid themselves with WALL-E. Apart from the genuine likability of Wall-E himself (as engaging a non-human character as any since E.T.), there are numerous homages to films as varied as SILENNT RUNNING (the 1972 ecological cult classic), George Lucas' low budget 1971 feature debut THX 1138; the Oscar-winning 2006 documentary AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH; Spielberg's A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and MINORITY REPORT; and even Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi/film-noir masterpiece BLADE RUNNER. And one must also congratulate director and co-writer Andrew Stanton for slipping in the homages to ""2001"", with the AUTO/HAL connection and the uses of Richard Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and Johann Strauss' ""The Blue Danube"", even if most children viewing WALL-E likely haven't seen that masterpiece or the other films this one references...at least not yet.There are also several ironic comments about human consumption and greed, personified by BNL's CEO Shelby Forthright, amusingly played by Fred Willard, and whose rhetoric of ""stay the course"" should sound vaguely familiar to any adult viewer. The messages, however, are never delivered in a heavy-handed fashion; and the focus remains on the relationships that Wall-E develops throughout the film, both with his fellow robots, especially Eve, and with the humans on-board the ""Axiom""; and all of this is aided by Newman's fantastic and futuristic original score.The end result in WALL-E is a three-pronged success: a typically successful animated comedy; a science fiction voyage; and a reminder of how we can change our planet for the better while there is still time left to do so.","

"mieriks","3 September 2023","This movie, about a small waste-collecting robot who inadvertently embarks on a space journey that will ultimately decide the fate of mankind, is a good family movie!At first glance it's surreal to see our planet this poisonous that contains cities of trash with only robots and small creatures moving around without a single human being. It's strange to see the Earth that unlivable, and the worst of all: it's scientifically possible, and we are on our way for it.Anyway, the robot WALL-E was one of the last remaining waste-collecting WALL-Es on Earth due to the lack of battery access, but this WALL-E knew his tricks. He had his own personality, preferences and techniques, and he had a nice life among his collections. This created such a good-feeling opening of this movie, and you can't take your eyes off from this innocent fella.The story is interesting, but personally, it can get a little slow. There are only a few highlights that give major impact on the story, and it often rather focuses on small details for just entertainment. But at the same time, some of those scenes have a surprising amount of depth and can melt anyone's heart, and that's what making this movie shine.When it comes to the technical aspects, it's truly a joy, both visually and sonically. The animation is top-notch, and the sound design and the soundtrack are worthy additions to this movie. It's a well made family movie, and all kinds of audiences are welcome to enjoy this ride.Overall, this is a heartwarming and well-made family movie with a surprising amount of depth. The story is engaging and the characters are lovable, and the technical aspects are top-notch. The movie can be slow at times, but it is ultimately a rewarding experience that will leave you thinking about the future of our planet.","

"gigan-92","13 December 2010","I saw the film and honestly believe it could easily be Disney's best. Pixar is already known for providing something different with each film, but this one goes beyond all others in its scope and tone. It works on many levels, that of a children's' film, a unique love story, as well as an sci-fi epic. Ben Burtt did wonders with the sound and yet these mostly silent characters are more involving and moving than any animated film's I've seen in along, long, time. The animation is visually stunning to say the least, and every shot is done beautifully. It's done with an artistic style that future films will struggle to even come close to.Not only that, but the film has a thinly veiled message concerning the future of our once precious Earth. The film delivers particularly clever writing, literally going well beyond what most thought could be integrated in a film aimed for children. Truly Disney's greatest achievement, although I to this day struggle over whether it overtakes my fondness of ""Toy Story"" and its excellent sequels. ""Wall-E"" is among the best films of all time.","

Humorous, touching, and enough metaphorical meat to keep artsy folks satisfied, I found it quite enjoyable.I have no kids, but was suckered into seeing it with my wife. I wasn't disappointed, and a little ashamed I didn't see it in the theater.Pixar, in my mind, sets standards for animated films now a days, and lives up the awesome legacy set out by Disney's original animation studio (Yes, I know they are a separate company). Much like Bioware in the realm of computer games, Pixar has never made a bad movie. That means it's one of the few brands you can trust.","

"mfellipecampos","16 December 2020","The objective of this work is to analyze and discuss the dialogues that the film Wall-E (2008) allows for the understanding of the Marxist Theory of Critical Environmental Education. Animation is an important medium that works as a window to reality, so that people can see, in a playful way, the things that surround them, so that in this way they reflect on the daily problems related to their social practices. Cinema is the seventh artistic expression, characterized by moving images with the use of techniques and visual effects. But cinema is not just the movement of images through a projector, it involves a complex ritual of different elements and processes that include: production, distribution, investment, advertising, taste, among many other social relationships (BERNARDET, 1980). And, in addition to capturing people's attention with its aesthetic language, cinema can mobilize, in a playful way, relevant issues of daily life and beyond. However, the cinema constitutes a social process, and as such it has political, ideological and economic influences, with that, it is necessary a mediation, theoretically based, so that it can be a critical and reflective medium in fact. Therefore, the Marxist Theory of Critical Environmental Education allows the individual to identify himself as an integral part of nature, so that he is able to perceive and value the environmental and socio-cultural diversity, so that they can adopt coherent attitudes within their community (LOUREIRO, TOZONI-REIS, 2005). In addition, it points to the need to build active citizenship, in which people participate in the processes of social transformation and constitute new paradigms that consolidate a more just and environmentally healthy society (CICONELLO, 2008). The 98-minute animated Wall-E, directed by Andrew Stanton, from Disney and Pixar Studios, takes place in a dystopian future in which planet Earth is uninhabited due to the extreme deterioration of the environmental conditions that humans have been exposed to. responsible, due to exploitation and excessive consumption and the consequent production of waste, affecting the release of toxic gases into the atmosphere, the contamination of soil and river resources, making life on Earth impossible. In this way, the robot Wall-E, and others like it, were responsible for cleaning the planet while humans are on a kind of space cruise. However, the recovery plan fails and Wall-E, the last of its model, continues to carry out its work, until one day a ship with a robot from another model, called EVA, appears unexpectedly, which Wall-E falls in love and will take him to the space cruise, which will lead to several situations. Given this, it is intended, through Qualitative Research, to analyze the film in question. Such research is concerned with the process and the scenario to which it will relate, being more concerned with the process than with the final product, thus differing from quantitative research, as the researcher intends to understand how the problem manifests itself in social interactions ( MINAYO et al. 2016). In this perspective, the film was analyzed from two axes, the first of which concerns the issue of garbage, in which the story consists of a metaphor for the consequences of excessive production of it on Earth by human beings. In this way, it is in line with a trend in environmental conservation education that only focuses on awareness and behavioral issues that aim to individualize solutions, that is, the resolution of environmental problems in this trend will take place through individual actions (ADAMS, 2005 ). However, in Critical Environmental Education, the solutions are collective, mainly concerning the productive system of today's society. The second axis refers to a great contradiction that the film presents, due to the fact that social, economic and political issues are not addressed, suggesting that they are resolved. However, it is worth noting that both the issues of excess waste and excessive consumption are linked to social, economic, political and ideological issues, among others. Such questions support the capitalist system of opposition between classes that are maintained from the exploitation of the working class by the dominant class (LEFF, 2001). In this way, the film, even though it presents a dystopia that occurs from a real problem, solves and ignores the question of class struggle, showing itself, therefore, idealistic. Thus, the film is an important means of debating environmental issues, based on their potential, but also on their deficiencies, aiming at the formation of critical and reflective citizens who act actively in society.Film reviewed on December 15th.","

"Matt_Layden","3 July 2008","WALL-E is a robot left on Earth to compact garbage into little squares after humans have left because the planet can no longer sustain life. 700 years of doing what he's been programmed to do and his only companion is a little cockroach. One day a giant space ship lands on earth and sends out a robot named E.V.E who must complete a classified mission.As soon as I saw the teaser for WALL-E I knew it was going to be something special. What I did not know is that it is one of the most original and entertaining films I have ever seen. Pixar has an incredible list of films under their belt and is the leading studio in animation, WALL-E have a spot at the top of that list and has set the bar for future animated films.Why does WALL-E stand out from the rest of the animated films that have come before it? Is it the incredible detail in the animation? The lack of dialogue for it's main characters? The epic adventure? The story or morals? Wel, it is all that and more. The first half of the film has WALL-E doing his daily routine of garbage compacting. Without a single word spoken we know everything we need to know about this character. The old saying of ""show, don't tell"" is used here and perfectly I might add. Through the endless fields of garbaged packed to level the skyscrapers we know that WALL-E has been here for hundreds of years and that the world is nothing but a baron desert. We know that we as humans did this to ourselves. We are given a quick back story through futuristic billboards that activate on motion when WALL-E passes them. WALL-E collects items from the trash that he finds interesting, everything from an iPod to a Rubik's cube. He examines them and tries to learn them, as if an alien from another planet were to come to earth and try to learn about our species. E.V.E arrives and WALL-E instantly falls in love with her, trying to win her affection at every turn and she turns him down every time because it's not her directive.This first half of the film has the most realistic looking creations I've seen in animation. Every close-up of WALL-E (specifically when he plays his radio device) looks amazingly realistic. Almost as if this is occurring in our world, it's not until we get to the second act that we begin to see more vibrant and animated aspects of the film. After WALL-E offers E.V.E a plant he found, she scans it and takes it. The ship she arrived on comes back, we begin to put thing together and WALL-E hitches a ride into space, a place he only dreams of. The mother ship is where all the humans are, they are fatter now because they are waited on hand and foot by robots, they are driven around on hover chairs and are constantly talking to another on a futuristic video phone, so much that they don't even realize the place around them. They don't even need to get out of the chairs to change their clothes, one press of a button and you go from a red suit to a blue one.The film throws back to the days of silent films and the lead character , WALL-E manges to show more emotion in a single look then some of the finest actors today do in whole films. The introduction of humans is when 90% of the dialogue kicks in and the plot is kicked into motion. I won't give it away because it is an important part of the story. The appeal of WALL-E is universal, everyone can connect to him through his actions. He is a cute, lovable and ultra-cool robot.WALL-E has been roaming Earth for so long that he takes the parts of other WALL-E robots so he can sustain his directives. He's rusted and falling apart everywhere, yet has a big heart. E.V.E is sleek and beautiful, yet dangerous. She can destroy you in a blink of an eye. These two robots are obviously from different worlds, have different directives, yet share a connection. What most animated lack WALL-E has. Most animated films as of late (Save for PIXAR) aren't adventurous enough. Kung-Fu Panada stays within the village. Even the Shrek films seem to be lacking in adventure. Both of those films created worlds that could go on forever, yet they never explore them. WALL-E seems bigger then it actually is and it's ten times more entertaining. It's one an only fault is that t becomes too preachy. It has a message and it gets it across, but it seems to beat you over the head with it. It's forgivable since the film flies through it's running time and has a grand epic scope of adventure that kids will love and adults will cheer. This is the first time I actually loved an animated film. Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Ratatouille are all great films, but I never had a strong connection to them as much as WALL-E. WALL-E is one of the best animated films of all time.","

"Joejoesan","22 June 2008","The guys at Pixar are known not to take the easy road. A world filled with speaking cars? Monsters that scare kids in order to keep the electricity flowing? Their fantasies are not the easiest ones to be put on the screen. Wall-E is also a daring project. It's the story of a lonely robot who falls in love with another robot, follows her across the galaxy and in the end saves mankind. Sort of.The problem with Wall-E is also the challenge of the whole movie. How can you make the audience care for a creature that is a machine? How can you make a love story that revolves around robots? Pixar does it with lots of visual Buster Keaton-like humor. Wall-E is clumsy, strict, kind and... lonely. Although E.T. immediately comes to mind he also shares a lot of characteristics with Mr. Bean. The first part of the movie - in which we see Wall-E doing his thing in a deserted human world - is actually the best. Visually stunning we immediately believe in Wall-E's world. It's dark, stuffy but fascinating.His dull life changes when EVE lands on earth. EVE is a high-tech investigating robot who has to report to a group of surviving humans. The two fall in love but when EVE must go back, Wall-E can't let her go. He follows her to a big spaceship that has been entertaining the surviving humans for 700 years. The ship was supposed to do so until earth was safe again to go back. But are the spoilt humans up to the change?Somehow the second part of the movie doesn't entirely work. The idea of a ship traveling through space is not new. Classic SF writers like Robert Heinlein wrote books about it. Pixar does a nice job by showing a society in which humans don't have to do anything anymore and all become physically supersized. This sarcastic tone is well done. But from the moment Wall-E arrives at the spaceship the story becomes unclear. What is Wall-E's mission? What does he have to achieve in order to save the humans? And do they really want to be saved?The end - where the humans give up their luxury lives to return to earth - seems somewhat illogical. The deserted earth that is presented to us does not seem that inviting. And that's a pity. Because Wall-E remains great entertainment and deserves to be a great hit. But compared to Kung Fu Panda the Pixar movie is maybe a little bit to ambitious to reach its real goal. Wall-E is a great movie, but not Pixar's best.","

"Mr_B_Natural","23 June 2008","Wall-E is the film Pixar has been working toward ever since Toy Story first tested the boundaries of computer animation. It is without a doubt the best Pixar film, if not the best computer animated feature ever made, and it ranks with the rest of Disney's classics.The story is both timeless and timely. 700 years after Earth's citizens flew away from their dumpster-like planet, one robot, the dirty and old yet clever and plucky protagonist Wall-E, is still condensing the mountains of trash into nice little piles. He discovers many of the trappings of civilization, most notably an old VHS of ""Hello Dolly!"" which teaches him about true love.His simple life is thrown into disarray by the arrival of another robot, Eve, sent from the humans' ship on a top secret mission. For Wall-E, it is love at first sight. But when Eve is whisked back to the spaceship, Wall-E stows away as well. Soon not only is Wall-E's courage tested, but also the humanity of all the citizens who have now become fat lazy blobs who live gliding along an easy chair.To start, the film looks gorgeous. While that is something we have come to expect from computer animated films thanks to today's technology, yet again we truly see the wonders and mysteries of outer space. But the film is much more than beautiful: it is also hilarious. On one level it has many topical jokes concerning the humans on the ship. But on a higher plane the humor of the robots has the quality of silent comedy, particularly Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (in fact, unlike most of today's very chatty animated films, there is very little dialogue). In addition, the visuals are accompanied by an excellent score by Thomas Newman (American Beauty). Songs from Hello, Dolly insterspersed in the movie also enhance the story. Finally the voices are skilfully done. The robots' sounds convey true character and emotion, and Jeff Garlingives a great performance as the main speaking role of the film, the ship's captain.There is a lot more to say about this film. For one, it owes a huge debt to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, from the musical selection to the look of the ship. The amount of plunder from Kubrick's genius would be pathetic if the film itself was not brilliant or innovative in its own right. Wall-E is an experience to be seen, to be heard, and to be felt. It is a story of timeless love and a cautionary tale of where we may be going as a species and as a planet. But above all it is a masterpiece of cinema, and a work of art you must see.","

"dj_xand325","18 July 2008","Wall·E is an animation with a distinct difference. Not only does it contain somewhat slapstick kiddy jokes to obviously appeal to children, it has a deep, dark message that will automatically stand out to all adults alike. Wall·E has been described as 2001:A Space Odyssey for all audiences, I agree. They share many similarities such as the lack of dialogue and the breath taking visuals. Furthermore, the story near the end is resembles the man vs machine storyline that was present in 2001: A Space Odyssey with the HAL situation. Not only that, the AUTO looks EXACTLY like HAL. Pixar wanted to pull off a Kubrick inspired animated masterpiece and they have. Its obvious with their use of Kubrickian classical music and the cold robotic voices for the robots.Anyway, heres the story briefly as in to not ruin it for you. Wall·E is a waste disposal unit who is programmed to clear garbage. He lives on the dystopian earth where mankind is inept due to the heaving amount of rubbish. Wall·E is the only one of his kind and therefore lives a lonely life of waste disposal. Until EVE comes along and builds an ironically romantic relationship with Wall·E. He follows EVE to a strange giant space ship that seems to harbour a new world. Wall·E then finds himself wrapped into a race which could save Mankind.I mention in the title that this film has a powerful message. I think that I can on behalf of many people that this film really is an eye opener. Its a realistic symbol of capitalism gone wrong, Technology gone wrong and finally waste disposal gone wrong. These commercial problems relate perfectly to current world events and Pixar has released this film at a perfect time. Pixar satirise all of these problems. In this odd world, you can buy lunches in a bottle, advertisements are plastered everywhere you can see, robots help every little movement you want to do and of course the inhabitants are disgracefully obese. People are lazy, stupid and unpleasant. The appearance is glossy and shiny yet cold and distant. This city of Pixaristic satire is a grim image indeed. Is this simply a whining attempt of protest from Pixar? No. This is feasible and people should see it as a reality check. Obesity is rising, Technology is becoming increasingly ridiculous and commercialism is ever rising. Ridley Scott's Bladerunner presents a similar commercial future yet Scott's representation is much darker which Pixar simply couldn't implement for a supposed kids movie!.As for Wall·E and EVE's relationship, they are both extremely cute and they're relationship was heart warming and beautiful. Its also somewhat ironic that they built a relationship. Wall·E is a clumsy and rusty looking machine yet EVE is a graceful and beautiful robot. But they have one thing in common, they are both alone. I feel that Pixar reveal another message here, that appearance isn't everything. Not the most predominant message but i saw it.As for the sound, the music used was rhythmic and surprising serious at some times. For example, the opening begins with a rather serious deep tune as the piles of trash on earth is revealed. This is a realisation that this is no kiddys film this is a serious animation beholding serious messages we need to consider. This is what made this so powerful for me. Kids will be watching this but deep down this is not a kids film. Furthermore, the score is consistently exceptional throughout the film and I would some sort of sound based Oscar nomination for Pixar.The animation was absolutely breath-taking. Pixar have wowed us every year ever since the animated triumph of Toy Story. Last year i was astonished by Ratatouille's animation but Wall·E is a step up. The animation is truly unbelievable, a triumphant achievement of technology.Pixar have pulled off a masterpiece, a unique conqueration of animation. This must be considered as a serious sci-fi film because it simply is. Only the greatest sci-fi's are as powerful as Wall·E. Pixar should expect many Oscar nominations, Best Animation, Best Cinematography, Best Sound and maybe even Best Picture. Who Knows? Its deserves it Praise for Pixar as they have pulled it off again with their most powerful yet comical sci-fi adventure film.Well what can i say? Its the best animation I have ever seen so go see it! 9.5/10","

"imdb-5032","3 August 2008","Despite having lead characters made out of metal and shiny plastic, this film has got heart & guts & balls. The visual detail is breathtaking and the animation damn near flawless. Just five minutes into the movie you already feel for WALL-E. No small feat, given that there are no supporting characters, except for a cockroach, and there is no dialogue, no voice-over. Then you realize that not only are you sympathizing with a robot - you are sympathizing with a robot that exists only as bits in a rendering farm. The level of craftsmanship here is amazing.Trigger happy EVE is one of the strongest female characters in film since Ripley in Alien. Note to film makers: strength is about being being independent. It is not about striking awkward martial arts poses in spandex or form-fitting leather outfits.It would have been so easy for the movie to portray humans as dumb and callous. But Pixar pulls it off with warmth and feeling. After 700 years on a never-ending cruise to nowhere, humans have grown fat and complacent, but they haven't lost their humanity.Certainly not for everyone and a bit sappy at times, this is a gorgeous film that shows even robots, nay, render farms can churn out compelling cinema with an emotional core (here's looking at you, George Lucas).","

"Special-K88","28 June 2008","In the distant future, planet Earth has been reduced to an uninhabitable cesspool of garbage and humans have been forced to adapt to life in outer space. All that remains is WALL-E, a lonely but durable and industrious robot who's only companion is a cockroach. One seemingly uneventful day, WALL-E encounters a highly advanced robot named EVE whose mission is to locate any remaining plant life, and together they go on the adventure of a lifetime to try and return the human population to their proper home. The latest concoction from the one and only Pixar Studios has some spectacular animation, a lovable lead character, and plenty of chuckles throughout, but the unintelligible dialogue keeps it distant, and the pace lags heavily early on. Story is too complex for younger audiences, the gags—surprisingly—aren't sophisticated enough for adults, but it's made watchable by a very appealing WALL-E. Some good ideas, but nothing as awe-inspiring as previous studio efforts. **½","

"lagudafuad","25 December 2012","WALL-E is just a sweet movie, which deals on the loneliness and determination of a singular robot that developed sentience while watching videos of human interaction and listening to music. WALL-E was the only one of his kind left on Earth and he kept at his job even though others like him have been unable to keep up and have become rust and parts for WALL-E to use to carry his singular assignment as a cleaner of the earth, along with him is a friend, a cockroach which WALL-E adores.WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter – Earth Class) developed a romantic endeavor with another robot named EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), a romance that Andrew Stanton (a Christian) the writer/director came up with, as he viewed WALL-E's loneliness like that of Adam in the Bible and how God gave him Eve as a companion, so the name of WALL-E's companion was named EVE in reference to the Eve in the Bible.With Stanton wanting WALL-E as a box with no mouth or nose and EVE as an egg with no mouth or nose the animators watched a series of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin movies for almost a year to be able to learn how to create emotions silently.WALL-E's plot is about a singular robot that in 2805 was still cleaning the earth after the humans were evacuated in 2105 to starliners. As the Earth was becoming a waste land humans had to be taken out of it so that it can be cleaned so when all human were gone, left behind were trash compactor Waste Allocation Load Lifter – Earth Class (WALL-E) robots, to clean the Earth but as the years passed all other robots broke down leaving except one, so this singular WALL-E robot carried on with the earth cleaning task.One day a beautiful robot named EVE came to Earth, and WALL-E fell for her; although she was a hard nut to crack, WALL-E triumphed but when her task was trying to set them apart, WALL-E followed her to a starliner where humans were, there we come across other plots and subplots concerning the humans if there are to go back to earth or not.WALL-E deals with a lot of major issues that we are either facing or going to face in the nearest future, the problem of waste management, laziness, obesity, consumerism and environmental problems that the world will be facing if we don't sit up.WALL-E won numerous accolades, including an Oscar for Best Animated feature, it was also ranked number movie in the 2010 Times magazine movie of the decade. It currently holds a 96% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 8.5/10. It was also a commercial success.WALL-E is one of those movies, which just stick with you, the nostalgia feeling it delivers, the innocence of love, and the determination of a singular robot, WALL-E is a movie that will always stand as one of the best Disney/Pixar has to offer.www.lagsreviews.com","

"come2whereimfrom","6 July 2008","Well I've just been lucky enough to go to a preview screening of 'Wall-E' and all I can say is its brilliant and simply one of the best films in Pixar's ever expanding cannon. Director Andrew Stanton whose previous film was another Pixar classic 'Finding Nemo' has excelled beyond anything we could have expected and here everything works perfectly. The animation is pristine and I'm sure sharper than the human eye can actually see, the score fits and flows with the story and the sound done by Ben Burtt (think all the weird noises from Star Wars) is crisp, clear and beautiful. Like any good Pixar film and any kids film worth its weight it works on many levels allowing the more grown up amongst us to laugh along with the younger audience and laugh you can as the practically dialogue free film sees Wall-E himself as a kid of robot Chaplin with each slapstick visual timed to a tee. A lot of this relies on the design of Wall-E a kind of cross between 'Short Circuits' Johnny five and 'The Black Holes' V.I.N.C.E.N.T. and the fact that he is so aesthetically pleasing while also being able to be so animated is part of the overall charm. The story a simple boy meets girl or should I say robot meets robot has been done to death but here seems to dazzle with a new lease of life and my only criticism of the movie is that at times the whole moral message of recycling, looking after the planet etc is a little shoved down your throat and I know it's the zeitgeist of the moment but I wanted to be entertained not bummed out. Elsewhere there are great pastiches to '2001' and 'Close encounters', the misfit robots are hilarious and never have fat people been so funny. Wall-E has everything you could want; it looks good, sounds good, is very funny and has all the magic you have come to expect from the boys at Pixar. Not only is Wall-E a great film it is as close to a perfect movie as you could hope to get. A big triumph for a little robot.","

"willcundallreview","3 May 2015","Rating-9/10WALL-E is a Pixar animation that is one of yet again, a great animated movie. It is just such a sweet tale with robots who seem so human like it is just amazing and lovely in equal measure. This film really goes to show that Pixar is at the top of it's game still and really to be fair in the world of animation, they are still reigning supreme. I thought this was just about amazing and here below is just why so.The movie is just the right length and so well timed as well with it's jokes but also it's more sweeter moments which blend together so well. The movie is pleasant all the way through, sure some things happen along the way but even in the more less happy moments, you still can't help feel a smile coming on watching little old WALL-E the robot trundle along, and on the case of WALL-E he is perfect as our main character, created with just the right amount of cuteness. It has such a beautiful score accompanying it too with Thomas Newman making scenes even more brilliant with his delicate touch in music. Peter Gabriel's song ""Down to Earth"" is amazing as well and when it is played in the final credits you will just feel so warm about this movie. The animation style is also a massive highlight here too, it is so detailed and yet keeps that signature Pixar style to a tee, just wonderful stuff and all credit goes to the staff for doing such a good job.One thing that really stood out for me is that the robots hardly communicate with voice, you can understand everything that is going on perfectly well with just the noises and actions of these really sweet little bots. I loved the style in which they talk too and the way Ben Burtt makes WALL-E's various sounds is just glorious with every little action and noise being completely flawless and yet again, so sweet.Now there is no doubt this is aimed at kids of course it is, but it brings up very important points about the earth and how we treat it, and ourselves. The way in which now humans can't live on earth because of so much toxicity is weirdly disturbing to watch and raises absolutely massive environmental questions even if it just an animated movie. It also brings up the old robots of the future question, now of course some robots in this aren't the best of robots but this is one of the first films where future robots are portrayed as sweet and actually have feelings.Now this is just fun all the way through and I couldn't recommend this more to anyone, whether kid or adult this is sure to make you happy and even the most grumpy of people could be swayed by this. It is also a good old laugh too, now I have seen funnier animations but this is still pretty funny so again all credit to the team and if you want a laugh too then this is it also.Overall it is sublime animating and must be one of the best animations of all time(I know for some it could be of all time!). I can see just why critics and cinema goers alike loved this and going into it I expected a lot but got even more than I expected afterwards.","

"dunmore_ego","22 July 2008","Earth. 700 years in the desolate future. A small robot that looks like E.T. blissfully rolls along on little tank treads, compacting trash into cubes that he builds into towering trash skyscrapers. He is a Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth class  WALL-E.Humankind has abandoned the ravaged Earth, leaving only their refuse behind, which stretches into orbit like filthy facsimiles of Saturn's rings; a dystopian, disturbing, Terry Gilliam-like vision, tempered by a smarmy CEO (Fred Willard, the first live human integrated into Pixar animation) entreating us with space as the final frontier, in holograms re-playing to dead cityscapes.WALL-E is the last of his kind - broken-down WALL-E's litter the blighted garbage-land. Unmindful of the dead planet, he plies his trade in simple joy. On his time off, he fills a cooler with artifacts, retiring to a derelict trailer each night (with a free-roaming pet cockroach) where he files everything, while watching HELLO DOLLY on VHS and yearning for tactile contact.Pixar Studios have slammed another one right outa the park! Written and directed by Andrew Stanton (FINDING NEMO, 2003), WALL-E is one of the few *original* movies this season (not a sequel or remake or derived from a TV show). How does Pixar craft these ingenious, inventive nuggets (where each viewing reveals new discoveries)? Their movies and characters are imbued with so much energy and verve, authenticity hits our nerves in all the right g-spots. A combination of effective storyline, unbridled 3D animation and cuteness so contagious it'll burn your breakfast.One day a thunderous spaceship leaves behind a sleek, pill-shaped ""female"" robot named EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), with a lethal power-blast right hook. Her mission: to find Life on Earth. (Waiter, there's a little iron in my irony.) WALL-E immediately falls in love.So begins a wondrous, accidental journey for WALL-E and EVE, back to the AXIOM, the spaceship housing all Humankind. By bringing back a lone plant, EVE signals Humankind may safely walk the Earth again. But there is a slight problem: over seven centuries, Humankind have become hover-chair blobs, insensate slaves to Big Brother holo-screens in front of their triple-chinned faces  Humankind can't think anymore, let alone WALK, their bones having deteriorated.Again, the horror of this totalitarian society might have slapped us in the BRAZIL bone was it not for the Pixar team injecting robot buffoonery at every pixel.EVE's plant becomes the symbol for freedom and sparks a power struggle between the ship's evil computer (voiced by Sigourney Weaver), who wants to destroy the green and continue cruising amongst the black, and the AXIOM Captain (a more cognizant blob than the passengers, voiced by Jeff Garlin), who is aided by WALL-E and EVE in potting the plant to drive the ship Earthward.And this is why Republicans are outraged! As juvenile and unbelievable as it sounds, the duplicitous, traitorous, treasonous swine of the Republican Klan of George W. Bush's Amerika vilify WALL-E for its ""message."" And what ""message"" are they protesting?...The ship's Manual instructs a return to Earth when organic life is found, yet the ship's evil computer has been instructed by Fred Willard to ""Stay the Course"" (Willard's exact words!) instead of ever returning to Earth if ""conditions on the ground change."" Sound familiar? Exactly! Though there is *no intent* to analogize Iraq and George W. McCain, the plot line accidentally highlights how unutterably asinine the McBush-Cheney administration's foreign policies are.Only the insane are offended by the insanity of the ship's computer, who *Stays The Course* supposedly for the good of Humankind, while keeping Humankind blind to the actual good it can bring upon itself.Trust the Repubs to focus on this paradox of their own laughable design, while the movie gets away with so many other anomalies: from anthropomorphism, to the ship's ""gravity"" which causes it to ""tilt"" when the computer twists the steering wheel; and the decision to go deep space, when two stable Lagrange Points exist on Earth's orbit where a ship could perch without any fuel expenditure at all, and could make the short trip back to Earth without having to traverse billions of miles through theoretical hyperspace and wormholes.Of course, I only mention these anomalies because I am a stickler for educative fiction. If WALL-E caused even one Republican's refried brain to reconsider their satanic party's non-ethics, I say: ""Thank you very much, Mr. Robot!""","

"keenan-1","11 August 2008","I just came back from seeing WALL-E with my 9-year-old son. I walked out of that theatre feeling as though I'd been hit over the head with an anvil. The message is about as subtle as a kick in the crotch, but it needs to be said and I'm just a little tired of some of the diatribes I've read that are masquerading as ""reviews"". People--it's a movie, and meant to be entertaining. If you personally are not entertained, that does not make it a bad movie, just not one that is right for you. And if the message strikes a little close to home and makes you uncomfortable, then maybe it's time to get off your backside and do something constructive about it, hmmmm? I go to the theater about three times a year at most--I end up renting most films from the shop because I don't like being pummeled with the noise that seems necessary on the big screen because people will not stop yakking away at the theatre. I really enjoyed the experience of watching WALL-E, and found myself laughing out loud repeatedly--and I enjoyed it far more than I did either the over-hyped DARK KNIGHT or INDIANA JONES AND THE LATEST PILE OF MONEY, both of which gave me sick headaches by the time I left the theatre.My summary says it all. I just about peed my pants while watching PRESTO, the short. As always, PIXAR is at its best when it's working with cartoon shorts. I haven't laughed so hard since the first time I saw FOR THE BIRDS, the short attached to MONSTERS INC.. It's a great homage to the style of Warner Brothers (you'll understand when you see it; the feel of it is pure Bugs Bunny) and if the only way I'll be able to own it one day is to buy the disc for WALL-E, I consider that a bargain.Oh, and for the record, my son, diagnosed ADHD (and currently not medicated), adored the movie, even the long stretch at the beginning when people's biggest complaint seems to be that ""nothing happens"". He was riveted to the screen the whole time. I'm not jumping on the bandwagon and claiming that this movie is some kind of cinematic masterpiece, but I felt that it was definitely worth the price of admission--and that's saying a great deal these days. Go to enjoy the quality of the animation, to be reminded of HELLO, DOLLY! (I'd forgotten about that movie--I really must rent it soon!), and, yes, to take away a message that perhaps it's time to be just a little more aware of what we're doing to our environment and where this might lead us. Rather than make excuses and attacking the message behind the movie, it might behoove us more to stop and ponder, if only for a moment, where we will be going.","

"Michael_Elliott","2 December 2008","Wall-E (2008) *** (out of 4) Pixar film takes place seven-hundred years in the future when Earth is empty of humans because of all the trash they left behind. Wall-E is a robot system who cleans up the trash but after years of loneliness our hero comes across a new robot who is here to see if humans can return. Soon the two are on a trip through space with the human race up for grabs. I can't say this film knocked me over as much as I was expecting but there's no doubt this is a very strong film. I was mainly attracted to the film after reading interviews with the production team when they said this was very much a silent picture and that's what they were going for. I think that was a great description and they certainly did their homework as the character Wall-E really comes off like a Charles Chaplin type character. I think the film also owes a bit to Spielberg's E.T. but that's certainly not a bad thing. The animation is downright flawless and the imagination behind it is simply mind blowing. The opening thirty-minutes were probably my favorite as we see what appears to be skyscrapers but on closer viewing it's just the trash that Wall-E has been gathering. The visuals in these early scenes are quite remarkable and that includes the house Wall-E lives in with various items that he's collected over time. The stuff on the space ship is just as entertaining with all the references to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The one thing that bothered me about the film were the ""human"" characters. I'm guessing there was a point in having all of them look alike but I never really cared for any of them and whenever they were on screen I kept thinking they were taking away from the real fun, which was the robots.","

"Kirpianuscus","7 July 2016","one of greatest animation character of the new millennium. and one of the most impressive animation films. for the delicacy to present each theme. for a love story who determine you to ignore each film from the same genre. for a dark image of future who has the right dose of hope to believe that a solution exists. for the seductive meeting between WALL-E and Eve. for the new perception about technology. and, sure, for the brilliant exercise to remember fundamental importance of small gestures. the poetry is the axis of this lovely story about humanity, robots and Earth. and the science to build, brick by brick, a coherent, wise warning about fate of world. so many themes who easily become boring... .and the magic of an animation to redefine the essence of each theme in a special film about a robot, its mission and its gifts.","

"kdnor2011","11 September 2011","Pixar, can you just stop making me love you. I mean, the Toy Story trilogy is one of the best trilogies ever made. The incredibles is my favorite superhero movie. Finding Nemo, Up, Monsters Inc, Ratatouille, all great. Even their lesser efforts like A bugs life and Cars seem to have at least more good than bad.Wall-e is the last robot on Earth. Meant to get clean up all the garbage we left behind as we fled to space. One day he meets EVE, a robot who was sent to Earth to find signs of plant life. She does, goes back to the spaceship, and Wall-e hitches a ride.I really loved this movie. I can't believe that two robots could have such chemistry. The animation is absolutely beautiful, easily some of the best I've ever seen. This may sound stupid, but was some of that stuff real? It also has a good message to stop being so lazy, or else you'll just get fat. Although it may hit you a little too hard over the head with it. Wall-e isn't Pixars greatest film, but's it defiantly in my personal top 5.","

"AishFan","23 October 2009","Wall-e is a magnificent film that, through a comical, playful, and non-preaching tone, well communicates and illustrates how we humans are making the earth uninhabitable. Global warming, pollution, and high toxicity levels have forced all of mankind to exode to a space-station to continue civilization and our species. Ironically, it is through the people's desire/curiosity to return our home planet that the audience begins to learn and appreciate the value of our Mother Earth. Centuries may have passed, but the ever-present human qualities of sloth, greed, and corruption are just as evident on the space-station. It is very interesting to see how the soulless robots Wall-e and Eva rekindle the spirit of life.","

"Puroo","22 August 2021","As I decided to write the review of this movie I saw the review under mine. It says that this movie is nonsense because robots do not have feelings. And this is the reason why he hated this movie. First of all, this is set in the future. We already have robots with emotions in the present day (just look it up). All we have to do is give it a set of commands using machine learning and artificial intelligence and send in the input of a million people for it to learn how to pretend to be emotional. And secondly this is a Pixar movie. Everyone has emotions. In Inside Out even emotions had emotions!So with that said, let's move on with the actual review. WALL-E was the Pixar movie that from which I learnt what Pixar was. I saw its poster in the newspaper and thought it was a cool robot movie. I asked my mom to let me watch it but since we come from a very conservative family, I wasn't allowed to. We didn't have a TV at home and even when we got one, we didn't have Disney Channel paid on it. So I finally got to see it a few years ago when I was travelling in the metro. And boy this is such a good movie, I'm really disappointed I didn't see it earlier.WALL-E is everything we expect from a Pixar movie. It has a central character who is identified by his desire to do something big. He is living alone on a deserted planet, still cleaning up everything because that was his job. His innocence is what makes him so interesting. The movie is also moving forward with character development and world building, which makes us, the viewers, know just as much as WALL-E does. There is nothing that we don't know and a concept comes from out of the blue. The only other Pixar movie I can think of where this happens is Cars.The second important character in the movie is EVE. WALL-E falls in love with her not only because she is also a humanoid robot with a feminine touch and voice, but also because she is the only other creature WALL-E has seen in this post-apocalyptic world. Other than her he has only seen rats and cockroaches, and we have seen how he treats them as a friend too. This is a metaphor of how we see the little things in life when we have nothing to either distract us or to force us to do something else. This is why WALL-E gets so much distressed when EVE puts the plant inside her and switches off, and also why he decides to follow her to space.In space also WALL-E is really confused. He was never designed for space, nor had he ever seen what space looked and felt like. He had also seen the humans physically for the first time, who have deformed to a point where they are no longer recognisable. Speaking of the humans, their bones have gone detached and they are literal jellybeans at this point, who can no longer work. And they are not in a shape to continue working for very long at this rate, which can lead to their extinction. All of this happened because humans didn't care about the planet and focused more on leaving it than fixing it.Once the humans finally reach Earth, they start their civilisation afresh on the abandoned planet. This is the most important message in the movie; it is never too late to redeem yourself. Many people think that the message of the movie is just to preserve the planet, but in my opinion THIS is the true message. Finally EVE and WALL-E unite and they live happily ever after, which makes it the most Pixar movie to ever exist. The animation, music, cinematography, everything is perfect. It is also suitable to people of all ages.This is one of those movies which will be used to define what the animated movies of our era used to be like. It is cool, it is well made, it has a message, it has many fans and it's made by Disney. Plus it has so much emotion. If this is not the perfect Pixar movie, I don't know what is (oh wait, yes I do. It's Coco).","

Especially the second half with all the chasing and hiding suffers from lazy script-writing.Still, as with all PIXAR works, an enjoyable movie.6 out of 10 ""Hello, Dolly!"" songs","

"MxS7HGS","15 December 2023","Opening with a realistic view of our planet's future, the first act of WALL·E is its strongest, with visually stunning segments set on Earth and minimal dialogue. From a technical standpoint, WALL·E is in a league of its own, with expert production design, jaw-dropping cinematography, and inventive animation photography that sets new benchmarks. The deftly written and confidently presented arc of the robots is emotionally invested, while the humans take a backseat. The heartwarming score by Thomas Newman makes the journey a deeply intimate, beautiful, touching, innocent, and soul-stirring experience.WALL·E and EVE are elegantly designed and express emotions so well that we are instantly connected to their thoughts without any verbal exposition. The film makes a wonderful ode to various products by Apple Inc. And is the best tribute to Kubrick's magnum opus, 2001: A Space Odyssey. The film addresses themes of love, loneliness, and companionship and has a lot to say about our degrading environment, inactive lifestyle, consumerism, and over-reliance on technology.WALL·E is a groundbreaking feat of computer animation, a wholeheartedly mesmerizing love story, and a fascinating sci-fi adventure that manages to come out as a winner in all genres of sci-fi, romance, adventure, or comedy. It is a triumph in every filmmaking aspect, a cinematic treasure that will be cherished for decades to come, and definitely amongst the greatest films ever made.","

"Dello_","29 April 2020","Don't get me wrong, Wall-E is a good movie that has also important messages like the care of our planet, the importance of an healthy lifestyle and a conscious use of the technology. It has also a brave opening for an animated movie because of the lack of dialogues in the first 20-30 minutes. But then as the setting changes I feel that the movie becomes a little too childish. Clearly this movie is intended for children but in other Pixar films this aspect was more balanced. Except for that the Wall-E is very enjoyable and it has also some references to very important pictures like 2001: Space Odissey and Star Wars and I'm sure I've missed some other more.
In conclusion Wall-E is a fine watch for everyone who like the animated genre but it can be hard to see for those who doesn't like some childish elements.","

"ssssgelojun","23 August 2020","There's a line in the review, ""Longing for love until the end of the world,"" that resonates. Yeah, even though the earth is covered with garbage and storms are frequent, my only wish is to be with you, hold your hand and help you accomplish what you want to do.The film tells a story of reincarnations and homecoming, and pays tribute to the so-called ""good olddays"", the slow pace of both cars and horses; Or only takes Amoment; It is the origin of everything going back from the high-tech era to the tree of life.Humans and robots are interchangeable. It's wall-e that keeps humanity alive, but humans have forgotten the instinct for face-to-face contact and hand-holding.When the seed had grown into a great tree, the creatures who had been called followed the common myth home.","

"neil-476","23 July 2008","If I disagreed with the trend, I would say so. But I don't. This is a fine film, a worthy addition to Pixar's list of winners.It always looks gorgeous, even when portraying the rubbishy desolation of the ruined Earth. There are moments of humour, suspense, romance (honestly!) and pathos as it tells a story which always holds your interest. The story carries a worthwhile message, and doesn't beat you over the head with it.But most of all, this film is notable for the way the character of Wall-E is the most human character seen on the big screen this summer. A metal box with caterpillar tracks and a pair of binoculars on top almost instantly becomes someone you care for. I went with friends and, near the end - you know the place I mean - 6-year old Daisy started snuffling. And I'm not ashamed to say that I wasn't far off myself.A lovely film.","

"Cocacolaguy912-2","16 December 2008","Toy Stories, Monsters, Fish, Incredibles, Cars, Cooking Rats - all very good, some brilliant. It seemed like after Ratatouille, the idea of Pixar making another masterpiece seemed outrageous. And it happened. In June they came out with Wall-E, right up there with the best of the best.Wall-E is special because for me because for a good 60% of the movie, there is almost no dialogue. In the beginning of the film, the audience is engaged by the animation, the robots, their mannerisms. Wall-E is such a vivid character that even without words we know exactly what he is thinking and feeling.The story is great, the music is astounding, really just a brilliant, brilliant movie. Another Oscar coming.","

"chubarova","14 August 2021","I think this animation is not only for children. Firstly, the plot shows us the world after people left Earth due to a lot of trash. We can imagine which future will be if the humanity wouldn't stop to produce so many trash. Also the animation has unusual romantic line. Secondly, I really love the animation style and technical aspects of it.So, it's great animation abou big issues of our world.","

"JohnDeSando","7 July 2008","""With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls, For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do, that dares love attempt."" Shakespeare's Romeo and JulietForget making love (I can't). The new erogenous zone is the hand, specifically holding hands as featured in the new Pixar animation, Wall*E. A futuristic love story between the titular trash collecting robot (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), doing his thing for hundreds of fruitless years, and a beautiful search robot, Eve (appropriately named), who discovers he has collected the answer humans floating in space have hoped for, evidence that they can return to their garbage suffocated planet.Like all love affairs, it's difficult to figure out their attraction, but love it is, and it propels this little gem of a film right into the endearing space of Nemo, Toy Story, and my favRatatouille. Pixar and writer/director Andrew Stanton have the gift of displaying humanity in its flaws and its glories while chastising its destructive side, in this case the neglected environment. While the love story, hand holding and all, is worth the admission, the satire of an indolent, wasteful population accurately disturbs as our population continues to get fatter and more environmentally careless, to the point where we vacate the premises.The animators have drawn heavily and artfully from Star Wars, 2001, Hello Dolly, Seurat, and E.T., among others, but most of all the wizards have revived the simple love storyit shouldn't take animation, science fiction, and post- apocalyptic stories to do so, but heck, I've been looking for love since my second failed marriage a long time ago. Who would have thought? Handholding! Now that's simple and provocative, environmentally safe, and my 3rd grade nun's criticism of me (holding a little girl's hand: ""You dirty thing""). You can imagine how I loved tormenting her and being in love at the same time. And we were the promise of the future (to which I complied with six childrensuch a good boy). Wall*E is the most satisfying love story of the year.","

"rneil95","30 June 2008","I saw this movie and absolutely loved it. Everything about it was purely wonderful. Everything about it is quite wondrous. The story, the characters, the voices, the animation, everything was amazing. WALL-E is a robot who is completely alone on Earth...until humans arrive, taking him on a huge adventure full of excitement, comedy, and romance. I think WALL-E is an amazing movie and may be one of the best movies I have ever seen. WALL-E is pure cinematic magic and should not be missed by any human. I will definitely get this on DVD, and maybe on Blu-ray as well. WALL-E may be Pixar's best movie yet and it's only contender's for a better movie are Toy Story and Ratatouille. WALL-E is great and should not be missed out on.","

"JephyrX","4 July 2008","It must be said I'm a big fan of Pixar films...and this film has all the elements you'd expect from their films including Amazing 3D animation and effects and high quality production values.From the beginning scenes you are transported to the film world they create. There's humor, intrigue, anticipation...and for children no doubt...some moments that may be a bit scary.The story is cute...but it doesn't contain many surprises.The characters designs were Pixar's biggest roadblock to giving a heart to this film. For example, the title character has virtually no facial expression except for movement to it's eyes. The animators were able to put some expression into Wall-E's ""body"" movements...but again this was very limited by Wall-E's mechanical, metal body. Wall-E speaks in a ""computerized"" voice that even further limits his expression.EVE, the other lead character, is even more limited, with expression mostly conveyed though very simple LED eyes and no other facial features. Her body is somewhat rigid and her arms are joint less and she has no legs...so most of her personality comes through her computerized voice.Wall-E has an insect companion...again with no facial expression so again all of its ""expression"" is conveyed through its body language and movement.This design concept is repeated with all the other mechanical characters in the film.The 3D human characters, especially later in the film, are identical clones of each other with very little differences allowing you to tell one character from another. At this point, except for one, they all even wear the same clothes.If Pixar was trying to tie its own hands...and make it as difficult to create endearing characters for an audience to connect to...they did an excellent job.The children sitting behind me sat quietly through-out the film and at the end they lightly applauded.So while this film is up to Pixar's usual impeccable production and animation standards...the story and characters held it down for me.Pixar's short feature before the film was very enjoyable with lots of heart and laughs...and may make this a DVD worth adding to my collection some day.Sorry Pixar...I'd still work for you any day!!!! : )","

"sddavis63","11 July 2009","In many ways this is a pretty typical piece of Disney/Pixar animation - except in this, instead of cute, adorable animals we have cute, adorable robots. Set about 700 years in the future, the story begins on an earth that is now uninhabitable because of the mounds of garbage that have accumulated. Humans are extinct (on earth at least) and the star of the movie is a little robot called WALL-E, programmed apparently to collect, sort and dispose of garbage. He continues his job long after the humans have disappeared, his only companion being a cockroach (they really can survive anything) - and WALL-E is lonely. Suddenly an alien robot named Eva drops in from space, and WALL-E falls head over heels, eventually accompanying her (somewhat against his will) to her spaceship. Once aboard the spaceship I thought the movie started to take on a bit of a ""Battlestar Galactica"" feel, as the descendants of the humans who had escaped earth find themselves struggling for control of the ship against a group of rogue robots.A lot here was very good. The animation was brilliant. WALL-E especially seemed almost real rather than animated. The relationship between WALL-E and Eva was developed nicely, and I felt a great deal of empathy for WALL-E as he battled his loneliness. The writers also managed the difficult task of telling us a story with very little dialogue (neither WALL-E nor Eva talk, except to stammer out each other's name.) There's a rather obvious political message in this, warning us about the environmental damage we're causing to the planet. On the down side, the story was rather predictable, and I'm not too sure that this movie would get a great reception among children, since the lack of dialogue and somewhat complex storyline might make it difficult especially for younger ones to follow. As its rating suggests, this animated feature might have more impact on adults than on children.On balance, I liked it, although I'm not inclined to add it to a collection so I could watch it over and over. 6/10","

"planktonrules","7 March 2009","WALL-E is a very popular Oscar-winning film, so my giving it a 6 must seem like sacrilege. However, I don't do this just to buck convention or be a jerk---I just thought it didn't have a particularly good plot. As for the animation, not surprisingly, it's absolutely beautiful--probably the prettiest CGI film to date.The story begins on a desolate Earth. Everywhere is garbage and the crumbling bits of a long-dead city are the home of WALL-E the robot. Apparently, his job is to help clean up the mess and it's obvious he has been doing it for centuries. You see no other robots, so you assume that they have long since ceased functioning. This portion of the movie lasts quite a while--with no dialog and not much story.A bit later, a probe lands on the Earth and WALL-E is thrilled because he apparently is lonely. The other robot seemed rather reticent to engage with WALL-E, but WALL-E follows 'Eve' like a stalker. Eventually, Eve finds a lone plant and pulls it inside its shell. Then she seems to shut down. However, a ship soon arrives and brings her back to a huge space cruiser filled with weeble-like humans. It seems that Eve's purpose was to seek out evidence of life on Earth so that the humans can return after a 700 year absence. It seems that they made the planet pretty uninhabitable in the 2100s and now, perhaps, it's time to go home. However, there is an unexpected glitch that may prevent the ship from returning.My problems with the story have to do with anthropomorphizing the robots. They are NOT human and they cannot possess feelings--yet in this Disney world they do. Well, this is hard to believe, but even if this is so, the robots only have a bit of a personality. They are not so lovable and they have very limited vocabularies. Because of that, the first 39 minutes are pretty dull, as there isn't much to do other than watch WALL-E (for the first 15 or so minutes) or Eve and WALL-E for the next 24 minutes. Once the humans are involved, it gets a bit better--but only just a bit. Most of this final segment of the film seems to be chase scenes and the humans are given practically no personality as well. I don't see how kids sat still during the movie and I assume this is a film that critics loved but I can't imagine younger kids loving with the same fervor as TOY STORY or MONSTERS, INC..Overall, a lovely film to look at so I give it a 7 just for the amazing artistry, but a rather unexpectedly dull story keeps it from a higher score. I know that puts me in a small minority, but this seems like Pixar's most overrated film. Heck, the short film that preceded WALL-E (PRESTO) was much better than the film that followed.","

"TheOny13","20 February 2018","Until 2008 Pixar has made a name for itself with great movies like Toy Story and Finding Nemo, but after seeing this movie I realized that that was only the end of the beginning for Pixar. Wall-E is a movie directed by Andrew Stanton and tells the story of a cleaning robot in a futuristic Earth who unwillingly gets involved in a space journey that could very well affect the whole humanity.Honestly the first movies that brought me into Pixar universe were Toy Story trilogy and Finding Nemo and some years later (as in this year) I decided to watch some more. Firstly I started with Coco then I watched Zootopia and they quickly become my favorite from Pixar. That was until I saw this movie which honestly is at least as good as those if not even better and maybe best Pixar movie ever? The story is so simple and yet so captivating and full of mystery. It quickly caught my attention from the first moments blending humor and intrigue with mystery extremely well. Let me tell you that the main robot in this movie is adorable and at times extremely inspirational. The movie itself is inspirational and also very mature with themes that resonated with and spoke to me. For example themes like: what will happen if our self-convenience would put a hold on us and made us lazy? Or... What will happen in the future to our planet if we continue to exploit it as hard as we do it now and not caring for it at the same time? What could happen if we could create AI and let it slip from our control and having them controlling us? These themes are so well explored while the movie is also entertaining that it makes movies like T2 or Matrix (which in my opinion are not at all good) or Interstellar look like a child written movies. I had expectation before watching the movie expecting a entertaining animated movie with a lot of fun but what I got was even more: excitement, entertainment and inspirational art. I understand how this movie got nominated for best screenplay because it's maybe as good as The Dark Knight was that year (also that movie didn't got nominated for screenplay although is one of the best movies of all time). That's why for me this is The Dark Knight of animated movies. It is on a different level from any other animated movies along with Coco, Zootopia and Toy Story 3. The animation was incredible... I mean 10 years later and it still looks like a movie released at least last year if not this year. The music was phenomenal and it is a shame that such a wonderful and brilliant composer like Thomas Newman still hasn't won an Oscar although he deserved at least one or two Oscars. As for gripes with this movie... there were certain parts where it was hard for me to think about certain events' explanations while enjoying the movie although by the end everything comes full circle and it's extremely well done. Aside from that this movie is pretty much flawless and one of the best if not THE best from Pixar.Overall a fantastic movie with superb story, great animation, mature themes and messages and a wonderful score. 10/10.","

"steeped","1 July 2008","Wall-e was a 700 year old robot and the last of it's kind on Earth. Since garbage and pollution on Earth rose too fast over the 22nd century because no one was ""green"", the earthlings decided to leave their home planet and live on a massive, technologically advanced ship. Of course with the advancement in technology over the century, some robots can't think for themselves such as the evil ""autopilot"" which turned rogue. But as you can expect, Wall-e is very smart and can be considered a person as he has the basic feelings of loneliness and the need for a companion.What makes this movie amazing is the camera-less cinematography. The computer generated images of the deserted Earth is stunning, and throughout the movie I was just magnetized to the amazing scenery. It was done so well that it really makes you feel for the poor robot and makes you want this piece of metal to succeed.Along with the amazing artwork, this movie is loaded with different messages which can teach morals to the adult and children audiences. Being green and recycling, obesity and loneliness are all very well told, and even though we may already know that pollution is a problem and that exercising is important, this movie really opens our eyes as the story of this one robot's troubles can be related to todays modern society.","

"huggibear","16 November 2017","Well, how cute is this movie? To begin with, Disney might have gotten Sony Pictures approval for their mimic of one of my favorite movies' character ""Number 5"" in the movie called 'Short Circuit'. Well, I loved this animated movie because of the character ""Wall-E"" and ""Eva"". Very well done animation and voices. The concept or movie plot was silly, but it worked for me. Simple, yet sweet. I'm not sure if it's an 8 Star, but it could be close. It would have had to have a way better plot or a sweeter lesson for today's youth which are the adults of our future. We need to emphasize more health in our movies and not mimic the current state/route of our countries' population in terms of obesity. I wish the movie industry well-being!

"urema-1","7 April 2022","WALL-E (Ben Burtt) is a solar powered, curious little robot with a sweet soul who only wants to love and help.700 years into the future and humanity is drifting through space on a large ship of convenience, the Axiom. Earth was overridden by rubbish and pollution so much that life there collapsed, they had to flee in order to survive.Many robots were left to attempt a clean up of the rubbish. Only one robot remains operational - WALL-E.WALL-E has been by himself, working day in and day out, and experiences indirect feelings of loneliness. He collects little trinkets that are of interest to him amongst the rubbish. He watches human films and listens to human music. And one day he finds a sprouting plant - the first in 700 years.WALL-Es stint alone is interrupted and his world is thrown upside down when a new probe, EVE (Elissa Knight), arrives on Earth seeking signs of life.When EVE finds the plant that WALL-E has, she is recalled to the mother ship - WALL-E stows away onboard.The auto-pilot orders on the Axiom have been engaged to never allow humans to return to Earth. WALL-E and EVE have to help override them to initialise recolonisation procedures on Earth.The film is an indictment against consumerism, mass produced convenience and immersive technology. It explores feelings of loss, loneliness, and questions many of the important things which make us truly human, and deals with a powerful theme of humans losing the only home we have ever known. The mannerism of the robotic characters are extremely expressive and well crafted.The lack of true dialogue with the two main robots is refreshing - it allows us to explore their emotions at the core, and grants us the chance to see causes and effects of situations much more clearly.The cinematography is grand and epic, resulting in almost every scene being a work of art. It is one of the most creative and original pieces produced by Pixar.","

Pixar have clearly outdone themselves, producing what is sure to be one of their best films ever. All the characters have personality, and there are no throwaway characters. Every character that is introduced in the story has their own unique personality, and it really shows how hard Pixar worked on the movie.The movie serves as both a sci-fi futuristic love comedy, and also a warning to humanity. We've got to take care of our planet now, because as charming as the movie was, I personally would not like to see those events transpire here, 700 years in the future or any other time.I would give this movie an 11 if I could. It is an absolutely brilliant piece of cinema and one that should not be missed. If you're a parent, take your kids. Even if you don't have kids, go see this movie, it's fun and lighthearted and will make you laugh out loud several times over.A+ Pixar, I can't wait to see what they cock up next.","

"johnnymacbest","28 June 2008","Every once in a while something comes along that wows you in such a way it becomes an unforgettable experience upon first viewing. When a film or any piece of art leaves an ultimate stamp on your psyche, you can't help but smile with nostalgia and euphoric abandon. WALL-E achieves all that and more. With little to no dialog, the movie holds its own; even against ""Kung Fu Panda, and that's a film coming from Dreamworks of all things. Audiences will find a lot to love about this ingenious and charismatic robotic character with all his perks, quirks, mannerisms, all in a semi-realistic/sci-fi setting. I'm not a huge fan of CGI animated features but this one captivated me not because of it's originality, but also because the main character is a robot which most people have trouble sympathizing with, mainly because they're used to so many animated animals and people (though there are some humans in WALL-E). But the human characters don't overshadow the experience at all. Simply put a great film with terrific character development and a story so heartfelt and engrossing I'm sure it will make tons of money at the box office.Here's to Disney for bringing something new to the table. There may be some similarities in terms of appearance to Johnny 5 of ""Short Circuit"" fame but WALL-E is his own character and he's definitely more lovable than said automaton. Anyone who appreciates great film-making or animation with a dash of wholesome family entertainment should see this film. WALL-E is to animation as Charlie Chaplin is to cinema. Don't miss it!!!","

There's the robot story, with Wall-E's crush on Eve being super cute while they're on a mission to deliver the plant to the captain. The other side is a pure reflection of humanity and our relationship with our planet. Throughout we see the Captain and a couple other citizens wake up from daily monotony to pay more attention and learn more about what it is to live. The Captain's line ""I don't want to survive, I wan to live,"" sums it up perfectly. In the end, both sides meet in the happy ending on Earth, which is displayed through the credits. Wall-E & Eve live happily ever after and help humans evolve & rebuild Earth from the ground up. Reduce, reuse, recycle. Protect and love the planet. Go for a walk & enjoy the nice weather. And beware of HAL & Auto - AI could still be after us.","

"on_the_can","6 July 2008","It's pretty damn impressive when a film can keep you engrossed for 90 minutes plus with virtually no dialog in it at all.In the distant future Earth is abandoned by everyone for reasons I won't spoil here. Before they leave, everything is turned off, scrapped, or taken with them...except Wall E, a robot who was accidentally left on. Wall E spends his days collecting junk, building amazing towers of cubed garbage, watching old movies, paling around with his cockroach friend(the only other living thing left on Earth) and day dreaming about one day falling in love. His dreams are answered when a girl probe robot gets dropped on Earth in search of organic life. Wall E falls head over heels and follows her home when her ship comes back for her. taking him on the adventure Pixar always promises.Like I said, the two leads barely speak, the only real dialog comes later by other characters after most of the plot has already been well established. But this doesn't encumber the story at all. Wall E tells us everything we need to know with his hands and eyes. The movie's not as laugh out loud hilarious as some of Pixar's other ventures but it's very entertaining and a high accomplishment in film making. It also has a lot of amazing imagination and imagery...the guys a Pixar should be proud.","

From the beginning of the film to the end I felt everything was so deliciously perfect, I was struggling hold in my tears. When something is as outstanding as this film turned out to be, I tend to be a crybaby. I just can't help it. When something so ingenious finds its way to the silver screen, I see it as a big victory. Having to live with all the garbage that's being produced in Hollywood, it's almost worth it, when something so beautiful contrasts to it and makes you think about what storytelling is all about. This movie had a strong influence on me, one that I've not felt since I saw the Mexican film, Voces Inocentes (which I highly recommend by the way). Why was it that good? Well, imagine pure eye candy for 98 minutes straight, a tear jerking love story with amazing characters and a rewarding plot.Loved it... Absolutely loved it. 10/10 Only downside is.. Pixar has raised the bar. It'll have to try and do equally as good films from now on or better and that's no easy task. But having seen this wonderful film, I'm full of hope and belief.

"fantasyescapist","24 July 2008","First things first  to be accurate, the film's pronounced 'Woll.Ee' not 'Wally', like the red-and-white stripy shirt boy and his dog that you were endlessly searching for on your telly screen and in the books as a kid in primary school  The voice acting is really good. Wall.E, himself isn't completely silent  he does vocalise some few words(like 'Eve-a!'), while others are bleeps. EVE( a vegetation evaluator), who he loves, talks in a computerised robot voice which sounds really effective. The Captain on board the ship, and some other humans the little robot meets all have natural delivery in terms of their voices.Pacing/Plot: Quite simply the plot is: Earth's been overtaken by our own produced rubbish that's piled up really tall over the years, so all humans have fled to space but they've left behind the title robot to clear up after humankind have abandoned the planet  and he's only got a cockroach for company. He's later joined and falls for a female shiny white robot then tries to rescue her when she's taken back into space on board a vast space cruise line. It seems inspired by old sci-fi films when Wall.E later ends up in space on board the vast cruiseliner and the film here turns softly but effectively satirical. Maybe quite anti-consumerist I'd say, especially when you get to see the appearance of the humans in space. Yes, it has a green message but it's not of the preachy heavy-handed kind Happy Feet had towards it's ending, in my opinion, and it's set in a realistic context for the film  700 years in the future! It constantly engages by scenes with even just with the lonely Wall.E and his cockroach being funny and sweet, due to his clumsiness, so there's a fair bit of slapstick and clever sight gags. Adventure, romance and a critique on our society and lifestyle all blend together well.Animation: Wow! Wonderfully realised visually  standout scenes for me is when Wall.E's followed into space and we see Saturn's rings and the Sun, goodness! The character design of our robot hero isn't original as it's a lot like Short Circuit's Johnny Five meets a robotic E.T. but even so he's still lovable all the same. EVE's egg-shape and general shiny white design is very good. Backgrounds are also detailed and I like the subtle way their personalities are shown just by their nuances in movement.Music: I love the score and the use of songs from Wall.E's favourite film in his lair: Hello Dolly.Overall: A dazzling animated story with a welcome subtlety done green message at it's core, and a lovably sweet robot. What sets this apart from loads of other CGI films released from other companies is it feels as if a lot of passion and inspiration created this and the film truly has a heart too, as big as it's own binoculars-head hero. This matches or even surpasses Pixar's own high standard laid down by the studio since their 90s output, in my opinion. I also loved the hilariously funny Presto short with the Magician and his rabbit before the film.","

"jochemunlimited","24 November 2023","When our daughter was a baby she really liked this movie, now 8 years later we watched it again. And while I watched it a lot of times when she was young, to see it back is just as amazing as back then.It still looks and feels amazing. There are little things you can pay attention too. There are a lot of simple jokes, the story is good with a good message and still very actual.I don't give a 10 easily, but this is for me a masterwork. Everything is right about this movie. And it feels like looking at art when you are on Earth.I do not have a feeling something is forced upon me, it does not as a political agenda, it feels like a fairytail.","

These are questions for which there are no suitable answer as the film is targeted at all audiences.Pixar Animation Studios 'knocks the ball out the park every time', and Wall-E is no exception. It's brilliant, witty, lovable and leaves you on the edge of your seat wanting Wall-E to succeed.A wonderful story for all ages. Loneliness, friendship, love, adventure, selflessness it has it all.Family fun for all. This Christmas sit down with the family and put it on.Highly recommended for anyone and everyone.","

"stonedraim","5 June 2016","**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.I attempt to force through my own opinions and preconceptions lately... and with and through that get more experience of movies and other things. So.... Wall-E is a movie I have neglected... thrown through the window with the sign ""Disposal"" over it. And... now I am sitting down and will watch this Academy Award Winner of 2009. It will be interesting.First off I am struck by the fine animations of universe and expecting some epic orchestra striking a magnificent tune. And.... well... no, no, no... already here Wall-E comes out with a Big Bang (pun intended) and let us enjoy... a little musical tune as coming right from the musical of ""Annie"". Interesting. And moving on.... Amazing animations showing the chopper perspective of a planet/city that has gone under some kind of natural disaster or something... the tune fades away and leaves us in silence with the words ""I won't come home""... spot on! Wall-E breaks the silence and rolls down and between some alleys and buildings... what song is that Wall-E is playing? Yes... the musical tune comes back. A lot of good directing, sound editing and the showcase of a production team making their finest. This is only the first couple of minutes into the movie. This leads to my first big honest laugh; a cockroach (or some bug looking like a cockroach) is Wall-E's friend and following him in its work. The 'roach is crawling into a ventilation system of Wall-E and tickles Wall-E... hence Wall-E is giving a little robotic giggle. Fun! Thereafter... a moralic chunk of message goes through the screen, to the story and gives the whole motion picture is in depth thinking; BUY LARGE.... a franchise that everybody is buying from. Buy a lot, and save money. Buy a lot and there will probably be much waste and with waste a harsh strain on our planet Earth. So, Wall-E comes out big time proclaiming that it is time for us to take care of our Earth.... otherwise we may end up similar to a well-known film about a robot on a planet collecting trash... did I hear the bell of wisdom sound off now? Really cool and top notch way of getting through with those commercial videos with real humans and actors in them... genius! Thorughout the movie there is a lot of moralic dilemmas taking place that is giving the viewer time to reflect. Nice touch! Also nice to see all the retrospective things like VHS, cassette tapes and....the game of Pong! Long time no see!A fantastic animated movie showing the aftermath of a probability where humanity has forced forward and maybe too far in getting robots doing every little daily issue and tasks. Where humans is living in a spacecraft for 700 years and lost all aspects that makes us humans; awareness, love, analyzing ability and so on.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Wonderful animations. Academy Award Winner! Further questions anyone? - The actors : Oh... Wall-E is fantastic in showing its feelings for Eve....a. - The story : A creation made by masterminds. Is the future this cold? - Entertainment : Very amusing. So exiting to see Wall-E and Eve dance in space. - Age : 78,4 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 9 Brilliant and admirable 8 Excellent movie and a solid production)","

"kylehodgdon","11 November 2009","Thinking back on all the Pixar movies I've seen I don't think there is one I enjoyed more than WALL-E. I think that it is a great triumph in this day in age to create an animated (not just) kids movie where the two main characters do not speak. A large majority of this film is more like a symphony that a modern film. The creators of WALL-E and EVE did a fantastic job of giving each character a face and a personality with what they had to work with. It really shows how actions speak louder than words. Sure WALL-E could say ""I love you"" to EVE, but instead he tries to show her his plant, the thing that he finds to be the most fascinating and beautiful in all the world. Another nifty thing about this film is that it really tries to send a message. Beyond the messages of ""love is good"" and ""be kind"" which most every Disney movie conveys, WALL-E also sends the message that you should not trash the planet and turn into fat slobs. And I commend the way that it pulls no punches in doing so. It comes right out, slaps you in the face and says ""stop being lazy and take care of your planet."" This movie is the best Pixar has to offer and one everyone should watch.","

"randomStuff101","11 April 2009","Childish, overstated, looks impressive. 6 out of 10 is still worth seeing. It's pretty good entertainment, but not brilliant or outstanding.Recurring themes are repeatedly forced, like how we're told that Wall-e has a crush on the other robot. OK, we get it. But just in case we missed it, here's another scene showing just how much Wall-e likes the robot. It gets tedious.Even the bigger eco-humanity message is clumsy, a saturating swipe across the story. No subtle interwoven story details here, this is bowling ball sized plot elements coming straight for us.In Wall-e, the plot holes are quite big. Enough said about plot holes.The bottom line is it looks polished. Cinematography is impressive. But there's too much of one robot calling out the name of the other robot, and in the end it struggles to stand next to the other Pixars on the same level.","

"Chris Knipp","1 July 2008","Earth is overrun with trash. Thus a little rusty robot has his lovely task: packing rubbish from humans, who've departed to space, into skyscraper cubes. WALL-E is a ""he."" We just know. WALL stands for ""Waste Allocation"" something-or-other (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), but of course it reads as ""Wally."" Wally looks a little like ET. Has some of the sprightliness of R2D2. Wally's in the survivor situation of Will Smith in I Am Legend, but has no vicious enemies, only a cockroach pal that follows him around. But Wally is lonely. Wally is a lonely guy.Animations anthropomorphize animals (as did ancient fables and the seventeenth-century poet La Fontaine), then moved on to broomsticks and other objects, and machines. Do machines have souls? Do androids dream of electric sheep? Will artificial intelligence rule? Will we have to rip out Hal's brain? These are perennial sci-fi dilemmas.WALL-E is a robot love story. It's also a chilling if hopeful picture of humans exiled from a ruined planet and turned into consumer blobs wallowing in a space mall called ""Axiom."" This movie oscillates neatly between austere minimalism and cornball sweetness, with many Star Wars battles smashed together in between. It satisfies children and adults, but only by not quite fully satisfying either. That is still an accomplishment, the classic Shakespearean one of appealing to all levels of the audience.Two ways WALL-E is wondrous are in the dusty, weathered look of its Pixar earth landscapes which Wally himself partakes of; and the endless mechanical business, the tricks and gestures of creatures and objects in constant, precise, often witty motion. But the loud sweeping music spoils the initial loneliness. How lonely can you be with a full orchestra at your back? And there is a limit to how much you can care about a machine. Or should be. Still, this movie for all its emphasis on tricks and images scores some surprisingly cool and resonant ideas along the way.WALL-E is a triumph of the work ethic, the little guy who matters. He's also symbolic of the utilitarian, no nonsense life. When all else fails, when there's nothing but junk, he's there, sorting it. He throws away a diamond ring, but keeps the box: it looks useful. The movie also celebrates the baraka, the blessedness, of much-used humble objects that through human contact grow soulful and real. In his junk lair, where he sleeps (dreaming of electric sheep?), he plays a little piece of an old musical on a videotape, people dancing and happy, a couple singing of love. This is the kernel of humanity that's saved.But WALL-E's a lonely guy, and when EVA comes, he's smitten. EVA is sent from ""Axiom"" to see if photosynthesis has returned. She--we know it's a she--is everything WALL-E isn't. He's rusty and clunky and articulated. She's round and smooth and white and her parts float in the air. He is indestructible, or nearly so, but she is higher tech, and emits sudden, alarming explosions, powerful and alien--yet somehow feminine. These are lessons in sexual differentiation for kiddies.For adults are the bloated helpless future humans we see when EVA is returned to space and WALL-E sneaks aboard and follows her. The finale is simple and schematic--it's a letdown, despite the fun, comic reference to 2001, and the way Aliens is evoked by using Sigourney Weaver's voice for the malevolent controlling computer of ""Axiom."" Are we the prisoners of our own device? Even when it disappoints, WALL-E is thought-provoking. The little robots are real charmers, and there have been many ingenious delights along the way.","

"imagiking","14 March 2010","The ninth film from animation kingpins Pixar, Wall-E comes with a considerable reputation. Boasting awards aplenty and an almost entirely positive critical reception, it adds much to the already significant commendations received by the studio.The film, a future parable, focuses on the eponymous robot and his single handed efforts to clean the world up after humanity has abandoned it, and their rubbish. We soon learn that mankind is orbiting in space, floating about in dozens of gigantic ships, awaiting the time when they may return to an again healthy world. We see the arrival of Eve, a scanner robot sent to Earth to detect signs of life. Wall-E, alone in the world with nothing but a cockroach and an old copy of ""Hello Dolly!"", sees in her a chance to know something other than loneliness.Wall-E provides an emotional depth rarely achieved by live action films. The animation of the main character is astounding, the realisation of this originally perfunctory machine as a fully rounded personality a stunning achievement. Through the simplest of motions, we are from the start able to connect with the robot and understand the poignant loneliness of 700 years. It is difficult to believe just how involving, engrossing and spellbinding the character is, and all that without any form of dialogue. Amazing. Once the plot gets kicking, we are treated to humour aplenty, a perfectly entertaining story, and an appropriate underlying message. The laughs come in equal measure as the tears; Wall-E's clumsiness as effectively brilliant as his hopeless romanticism. The running motif of his desire to hold Eve's hand is wonderfully moving, as beautiful in its implementation as the emotional scope of his eyes.Incredible animation, an emotional depth unparalleled by its rivals, a perfectly fine plot, and an important message. Wall-E is a great, great film.","

"agmoldham","18 July 2008","Pixar broke the mould with Toy Story by creating animated movies that are equally as enjoyable for adults as children. They have a craft for making their films enjoyable on both levels. I can only vouch for WALL-E from and adult perspective, but judging by the kids at the cinema they also thoroughly enjoyed the movie.WALL-E is somewhat different from many of the other Pixar movies in that it is much larger in scale. Whereas most of the other movies have been very much individual 'character' based movies this has bigger themes. It concerns a world which mankind have left due to pollution. WALL-E is seemingly the only robot that is left which is busily cleaning up the mess we've left behind. The humans have become grossly lazy on their spacecraft and send down robots to check on the state of the earth to see whether it is inhabitable again. They have been away for 700 years and are waiting for the environment to recover. Some of the images are quite thought provoking and portray a rather bleak version of the future.The main thread of the movie concerns the romance between WALL-E and EVE who has been sent to look whether plant life has returned to earth. As with most of the Pixar movies it's totally engrossing and you really care about the characters by the end of the movie. A very enjoyable movie and as usual with the Pixar movies the short beforehand (Presto) is superb as well. There's nothing to see during the end credits though this time although the end credits are very well done.","

"thinker1691","30 December 2008","For several decades, some of the most brilliant scientists have been warning Earth governments, officials and their populations of the dangers of Global Warming and the consequences of not doing anything to stop it. Yet, Year after year and decade after decade, with a gigantic preponderance of accumulating evidence, our planet Earth is in danger of environmental disaster, yet few officials in any country are doing anything to stop it. They are like President W. Bush, who refuses to acknowledge our guilt, pretending it isn't our responsibility and burying their heads in the sand, hoping it will go away. This movie called "" Wall-E "" (Ben Burtt) is but one dark future ahead of us, if we do nothing. Planet Earth, 700 years into the future, has one remaining robot called Wall-E who is still carrying out it's primary function. It's job is to collect Earth's rubbish and make squares out of it and stack it into sky high column's, creating a replica of Earth distant past. Busy carrying out it's duty, Wall-E is interrupted, by a Earth probe, designed to learn if there is any plant life left on the Earth. The new probe is called Eve (Elissa Knight) and has our hero robot falling for her. The two machines are drawn together in a human-like drama which becomes a heart felt tribute to story-tellers everywhere. Both bring together the human race floating in a deep space vehicle commanded by Captain Jeff Garlin. Realizing the human cargo needs to return to their home planet, before they all sink into total atrophy, the Captain decides to head for home. Their only problem is the ship's computer called MacInTalk or AUTO who has orders to stop them. The story is compelling in many ways and is destined to become a classic. ****","

"moviewizguy","28 June 2008","The year is 2700. WALL-E, a robot, spends every day doing what he was made for. But soon, he will discover what he was meant for.I have just finished seeing this film on the big screen and there's no exception here, Pixar has made another brilliant film! No, Wall-E is nothing short of what movies should be. What can I say about this film? What makes it so great? To start it off, there is barely any dialog in here. The first 30 minutes into the film has no dialog at all, yet the film manages to pull it off.The look of the film is very grand and visually extensive, no doubt. The animation is pitch perfect, like the rest of Pixar's previous films and this movie actually pulls off a great plot! And you know what I'm worried about? People will complain the movie is ""too preachy,"" while one critic already said it's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" for the kids. If you're one of those people, please don't be such a wimp and fuss about because there's a good moral message in here, along with an irresistible romance between the two protagonists, Wall-E and Eve.While it's really hard to decide which is the ""best Pixar film,"" Wall-E could be nominated. It's one of the more satisfying films I've seen in theater that was worth the money. I also found the movie touching and heart warming, as well as hilarious in some great comedic scenes. I also found the film awfully similar to ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" even though I have never seen it in my entire life. I guess that's a homage.As I ramble on with the movie I've just seen, let me finish this off by saying that this movie is worth your time and money. I find it the best film of this year, so far and I think it'll be hard to beat in the Oscars. The film is better for the adults than for the kids, if that's possible, but everyone at all ages should like it, unless they are cold-hearted.","

The visual clarity of this movie is the best I've seen yet. The details packed into it merit several watchings and still-frames.Getting on to my review title, I have a hard time understanding how some people could give this under 5 stars, let alone 1. Were they in a rotten mood the day they saw it? There's no accounting for taste, but actively disliking such an interesting movie is weird to me.

"ackstasis","21 September 2008","The first forty minutes of Pixar's 'WALLE (2008)' comprise the most fascinating and skillfully-executed science-fiction story since well, it's been a long time. Alone on a near-lifeless Earth centuries after the evacuation of the human race, a lone garbage robot, the last of his kind, obediently continues to carry out his duties, compacting rubbish into solid cubes and piling them into lofty buildings. The sky is brown and dusty, smothered by the detritus of Mankind's wastefulness, and the garbage cities are often bombarded by stinging dirt storms that ravage the filthy landscape. But, thanks to WALLE (an acronym for ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth-class""), there is still life to be found on our planet's barren remains. As he goes about his day, our delightful little hero picks up any odd item that happens to catch his eye  a Rubik's cube, a plastic ""spork"", a light bulb, and, dearest to his heart, a battered VHS tape of Gene Kelly's 'Hello, Dolly! (1969),' which inspires the romantic in him.One day, WALLE befriends a lonesome and resilient cockroach, and the pair carry on with their job each day, even discovering a single, tiny plant growing in sterile soil. Then, one day, love comes erupting into this little robot's life. A slick, white (and female!) robotic probe named EVE (""Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator"") arrives on the planet in search of photosynthesising organisms, blasting any perceived threats with her trigger-happy plasma cannon. Needless to say, WALLE, however rusty his exterior, falls immediately in love with this beautiful feminine visitor, and what ensues is a genuinely-touching love story that serves as a charming amalgamation of Chaplin's 'City Lights (1931)' and Trumbull's 'Silent Running (1972).' Best of all, and very daringly for a children's film, this entire opening act unfolds with minimal dialogue, the two robots restricted to shrill buzzes and brief electronically-articulated utterances. Thus, their communication is almost exclusively through body language, and more meaning and emotion is recognised behind WALLE's deep, sincere eyes than is to be discerned from most real-life actors.Had Pixar sustained this level of brilliance for the remainder of the picture, I would have had little reservations in declaring 'WALLE' a masterpiece. However, for its final acts, the film descends slightly from the stratosphere of excellence, and eventually begins to acknowledge its human participants. After WALLE hitches a ride on a departing spaceship, he ends up at a distant space station named ""Axiom,"" where the surviving human civilisation, now hopelessly obese beyond belief, idles away their lives before computer screens, allowing machines to cater for their every need. This commentary on our increasing over-reliance on technology (and technology's inevitable revolt) has been done to death in science-fiction, comprising everything from '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)' to 'Alien (1979)' to 'I, Robot (2004).' In contrast to the deep, earthy colours of the earlier segment, here the colour palette is bright, vivid and almost migraine-inducing, the visual equivalent to being injected with an overdose with caffeine. These sequences work to a degree, but the human characters are ill-defined, and so all we really care about is WALLE.This being Pixar, of course, the film contains countless minute details that will thrill parents who are observant enough to catch them. There's the mutinous HAL-like ship computer, that nostalgic Mac start-up chime whenever WALLE recharges, the adorable cleaning robot who feverishly scoots around the ship chasing foreign contaminants, the obligatory inclusion of both ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and ""The Blue Danube""; I was also amused to notice a brief snippet of D.W. Griffith's 'A Corner in Wheat (1909)' when the ship captain (Jeff Garlin) requests a definition for ""earth"" {this, I suppose, is how you distinguish the true film buffs from the fakers!}. Younger audiences will probably find the film's second half  with its zany colours, funny characters and chase sequences  to be more appetising, but perhaps the more mature among us will lament the passing of that lovely, wholesome innocence in WALLE and EVE's silent courtship, a style of art practically lost in time since the Little Tramp told his girl, ""Buck up - never say die. We'll get along.""","

"japamo","12 August 2010","I do regret missing seeing ""WALL-E"" on the big screen, so I had to console myself by watching this ""mechanical"", post-utopic, sci-fi romance melodrama on Encore at home. My attitude towards the overall product is somewhat ambivalent. Overall, I am generally glad that I saw it, but I am leery of comments declaring it a complete masterpiece. Make no mistake; WALL-E solidifies Pixar's impressive track record of entertaining movies with something substantial to say, but I felt that in the last analysis it gives its unassuming protagonist a little bit of short shrift.WALL-E (hereafter WALL-ET because of his obvious homage to ET and his beneficial effect upon Pixar's revenues, hee-hee) is a bit of a Frankenstein. In addition to ET, he is also an amalgamated mash-up of R2-D2, Johnny 5 from the ""Short Circuit"" films, the gardening droids from ""Silent Running"", and even the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. This sentient trash disposal unit lives a near solitary existence on a trash-besotted Earth in the 29th century. Ironically, although it looks like a sepia-toned nuclear wasteland, Earth just choked up on its own refuse. Humans have abandoned the planet and plan to return when Earth is once again habitable. WALL-ET's eternal job is to clean the rubbish one cube at a time. He has done this so long he has constructed cubed junk towers and pyramids. During his eons-long existence he has accrued enough sentience to collect discarded items like a packrat, watch a time-worn ""Hello Dolly"" videocassette (what, no DVD?)and to befriend the only living thing left, a surprisingly appealing cockroach (although given their legendary durability, WALL-ET should have had thousands of cockroach friends).The first, rough third of the movie silently records WALL-ET's bleak daily grind. The second third of the movie depicts WALL-ET's encounter with a ""feminine"" robotic scout from a reconnaissance ship. Named EVE, her job is to scan Earth for any signs of vegetative life. At first, WALL-ET and EVE's encounters and courtship is tentative and perilous, as EVE basically regards WALL-ET as a hostile enemy good only for shooting and WALL-ET timorously tries to make friends with her. EVE eventually warms up to WALL-ET when he shows her a plant he has transferred to an old shoe (for me, this was a poignant moment that asserted that life will always find a way no matter what). She appropriates the plant to take back to the mothership, the Axiom, for analysis. Upon analysis, the Axiom will determine that it is time to return home with its cargo of dispossessed human passengers.So, for the first two-thirds of the movie I was quietly charmed by stark, photorealistic scenery and themes of loneliness, abandonment, contact, human profligacy, and corporate greed (Buy & Large being the corporate villain - clever name! By and Large, buy and enlarge, get it?) Pixar is our ""American anime"" with its meticulous rendition of mechanical and non-organic characters. However, in the third and final act, when WALL-ET follows his new friend EVE to the Axiom, that same ""American anime"" showcases the same weakness as its Japanese counterpart - goofy-looking, grotesque humanoids.The Axiom resembles an ultra-modern space cruise ship that caters to everyone's need. However, the passengers have been at space so long (700 years) that they have regressed into flabby beanbags with appendages. They need hoverchairs to get around. WALL-ET encounters both mechanical and human obstacles on his way to meet EVE again, and the overall chase is fun. Yet, the problem I found with the movie at this point is that although nominally the hero, WALL-ET, for all his appeal and pluck, is eclipsed by EVE and the Axiom's captain, just as Bilbo Baggins was eclipsed by more colorful characters in ""The Hobbit"". The captain's struggles against his ship's computer AUTO, and his own physical inertia take precedence. Even when our little reluctant hero sacrifices himself to save the Axiom a la ET, he is still eclipsed. Of course, EVE saves him with the spare parts WALL-ET has amassed on Earth, and the captain manages to bring the passengers back to Earth for recolonization. Uplifting as this ending is, it seemed too pat and abrupt for me.Nevertheless, ""WALL-ET"" is much more than a sensationalistic thrill ride and the adventures of the obligatory cute robot seeking companionship. It is also an ultimately somber and disconcerting testimony to conspicuous excess and wretched consumption, which it took a dedicated trash compactor to point out.","

And, yeah, point taken: Waste, garbage, meaningless consumption, machines more human than the fat, over- indulged human beings. And, additional point taken, we, the humans, are really okay, once we wake up. Is there anything that's not cliché in here? Ungh. And the human characters. Well, they're just ""Okee Dokey"" machines. Live a life of luxury out in space? ""Okee Dokey"". Return to Earth? ""Okee Dokey"" Face the Herculean task of repopulating Earth which is still a stinking garbage dump, with bodies totally unsuitable for the task and no knowledge whatsoever? ""Okee Dokey"". It doesn't ring true. Didn't anybody want to stay out in space in the lap of luxury?Ungh.Now, Pixar features have been known to grow on me, and that might be the case with WallE. If that happens, I won't eat my hat. But I will edit this review.Update: It's the day after the Oscars. I have to admit. I still don't get it. After having seen it again on DVD, the movie has actually gone down in my estimation. The one thing it has over all other CG movies of it's year is the best rendering. These guys make visual art. BUT, the story was even worse on 2nd viewing. It just doesn't hold together well. EVE is looking for life, but blasts anything that moves. EVE is looking for life, but the cockroach doesn't set off her alarm. They make a point of showing the artificial gravity turning on when the ship carrying EVE returns to the AXIOM, so how come when OTTO tilts the ship everyone slides to one side? If OTTO got these orders not to return to Earth, why send working EVE probes out? Wall-E is so broken at the end that after EVE repairs him, he's just a standard issue Wall- E...but only for a while. Then, uh, I guess, some magic happens. Never mind how. It just does.","

WALLE is so cute, he carefully collects those tattered, treat them like treasures, and take them out after work every day. When EVA came, WALLE's heart was opened in this way. He experienced such a long wait, and longed for a pair of hands to hold him, so that he would no longer be alone. In order to save EVA, WALLE used almost every effort, at all costs. Like us humans, we still yearn for love until the end of the world.","

"CagedinSanity","14 December 2008","(Warning, the spoilers are seamless within the review so it's best not to read if it spoils for you).I think this is my first 10. If I ever write a review for Stranger Than Fiction, it would get a 10 as well.This is saying a lot because I'm a pretty cynical person, and critique things to death even when I like them.That said, those people at Pixar are not movie-makers, they're artists.This movie opens up with a complete 30 minutes of what a critic might describe as boring. It's slow, but it's so imaginative and it sets the basis for Wall-E's character almost perfectly. Not only that, it makes you really think. It explains what's going on WITHOUT dialog, to a certain extent. Such as the play-over advertisements kind of add to the silence, but they could have gotten away with it, like they did with the Billboards and the Wall-E units.It also shows an older movie clip that I'm too young to identify, and shows that Wall-E is more human than some humans, even. His infatuation is further evolved when Eve gets dropped on the planet, who shows a bit of human nature (her)self while she takes a freedom joyride when she's out of visuals with the ship that dropped her off. Almost immediately you can tell the emotions of these robots. You can tell Wall-E is enthralled, and you can tell Eve is a bit mournful of her position as a directive-driven peon. It's brilliant. It's seamless.I read one review before I watched the movie that the movie falters a little once they actually added the humans and the actual dialog. Let me tell you, it really doesn't. It simply adds more characters of a non-robotic nature and they develop them as well! It's been a bit long so I cannot recall the names of the man and woman that the movie emphasizes on but it evolves the storyline when you discover that these humans don't even know what they're doing anymore. They didn't know they had a pool, they were barely alive and became more robotic than the actual robots.It's an amazing contract to what we know as humans and robots today.And the romance was done beautifully. You would think that love between robots is an odd concept, but it's actually evolved more than the standard ""Love at first sight, few hours later, it's mutual."" No, the romance takes the entire movie for it to actually manifest and you find yourself thinking ""Does Eve like him back!?"" And I was really hit in my heart and mind near the end when Wall-E lost his memory and Eve tried coaxing him back. (If I had any complaints, it's the way his memory returned. If a memory unit is replaced, it really -is- replaced. But this is a child's movie and the rest of it was phenomenal so I couldn't slam it for that).I could go on how the movie perfectly blends dreary emotions with happy ones but I might be going over my word limit here. There's just so much I could comment on.This is without a doubt on my top movies list, a must own, and must watch. And that list isn't that big. Definitely an honor, no-- it was an honor to have seen this film.Thank you.","

"Manal1987","6 June 2009","Heading straight to may all-time favorite anime movies! Pixar really knows how to make a ""film""!! The people working there proved that it's not about the complicated story or the witty script or the-state-of-the-art graphics, for Wall-E has none of these. Despite that, the movie has it all... the beauty and simplicity of ideas, the humanity of characters, and the pure and genuine emotions. Although the character of Wall-E almost says nothing throughout the movie, it will certainly put you in tears of laughter and pity. Wall-E is a beautiful experience about how communication and love transcend the tangible and embrace the subtle.","

"Sotalo","29 June 2008","Wall E is set far in the future... 800 years into the future. By that time, Earth would have been so full of mess that life could not be sustained on it. So, all the Earth's citizens left Earth on a spaceship cruise and left behind thousands of robots known as Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class. The robots are supposed to clean up the Earth, and once evidence of life is found everyone can return. But the program was forgotten, and there's only one sole remaining Wall-E.I've seen all of Pixar's work, and I can say very confidently that the first half hour of Wall-E is full of the darkest and deepest scenes Pixar has ever created. The story opens in a ghost city, revealing the life of Wall-E. His ultimate job is to... compress garbage. However, while rummaging through the garbage, Wall-E adds certain items he finds while rummaging through the garbage to his personal collection. Wall-E breaths life and personality and remains a lovable character while still being a robot. Throughout the story, Wall-E encounters Eve, a robot sent to search for life on Earth, and he falls in love (any further about the plot, and I'd be spoiling the film). But Wall-E has the personality, while Eve is... a robot. She's cold, cruel, and insensitive.What makes Wall-E untraditional to most cinematic masterpieces is its lack of dialog. The robots feelings are shown through a compilation of sound effects, body language, and expressions. Wall-E's emotions can always be detected by his binocular-eyes alone. The story is still told without much dialog between the main characters, and told rather effectively. Hey, I understood it much easier than Ocean's Thirteen, so the lack of dialog can't be that bad.Wall-E is among one of the few Disney-related Science Fiction movies, and the only one with an (mostly) ecologic theme. The ecologic theme is secondary to the love one, so it's not overwhelming (especially for children). The depiction of life in the far future is however depicted to be incredibly twisted, so some kids could get hung up on ""drinking"" lunch instead of enjoying the film. In a world controlled by computers, the human effort stands above all, and if kids end up watching this movie, they would realize it as well.All in all, Wall-E isn't an adventure anyone should miss. The movie isn't restricted to kids or to adults, which is a key label associated with Pixar. The movie is without error, and Pixar once again stole the big screen. I want this movie on DVD as soon as possible.","

"ChristianUnchained","23 April 2013","A consistently ingenious little animated comedy. The material here is fairly dark and mature, while there are plenty of laughs for the kids. Pixar knows how to blend these styles in an expert manner, and Wall-E proves it, further proving that the creative process is, at its core, the most important first step in creating a memorable film. Wall E is memorable, emotional, very funny and important. Its wonderfully told minimalistic story is ingenious, and the movie is brought to life with technical wizardry. I do believe certain elements could have been drawn out and couple plot points further expanded upon, but overall Wall-E is one incredible little animated film.","

"Tolbert","16 September 2008","Pixar has done it again! I love their films, I can sit and watch any of their films with the kids and I enjoy them just as much as they do. My favorite one is still ""Monsters Inc"".Wall-E teaches us some great life lessons though. Some of it's obvious, with regards to trash for example. It's definitely a good idea to recycle and try not to trash the whole world (or space too in the case of this movie) but there's some great advice in their besides that.Wall-E takes us to a world where technology has made us all extremely lazy to the point where nobody does anything for themselves anymore. Not only that but it has made people anti-social toward other people. The very technology that people are so fascinated with could lead to our own undoing. By immersing ourselves in video games and online chatting all day long, we forget what it's like to just get out and talk to people...imagine that! The film isn't preachy though. It gives out advice and shows that this is one particular path we could all be headed in if we're not careful. It's great fun for the kids too. It's amazing how you start to feel genuine empathy for two robots and a cockroach.Fun for the whole family, I recommend it very highly","

"stargunner","28 June 2008","Wall-E, to me - as an animator - is a lot more than just a movie. I think it represents a turning point in the world of animation. Ever since Disney took a tumble these past couple of years with a lot of misfires, I think people were starting to lose hope in the animation industry.But Pixar has always stood from the crowd. Pushing the boundaries and dodging the conveniences of the 3D, Pixar has treasured the traditions of the old masters of animation and brought them to the new dimension of animation.There's no doubt Wall-E is insanely detailed down to the finest grain. But that's just the icing on the cake to the three things that I think Wall-E will change about animated feature films.First off, Wall-E breaks the stereotype that animated films are just for kids. There's still a strong feeling amongst moviegoers of the opposite. To remedy this, many animated films have simply thrown in a couple cheap innuendos that their parents kids won't get for another five years to get a couple laughs. Wall-E, however, unites audiences of all ages with brilliant staging and acting, and I think it will begin to break the stereotype that animated films are only for children. No matter if you're 9 or 90, the happy and the sad moments were shared by everyone.Secondly, Wall-E proves that you don't need to drop the G rating to make an entertaining film. I don't know if a lot of people do know this, but Wall-E does in fact have a G rating, and I can't remember the last time I've seen a widely released film with one.And lastly, Wall-E demonstrates that acting always triumphs over ridiculously jam-packed and gimmicky scripts. There's hardly any dialogue in this movie, and rightfully so. From every wild action scene to the most delicate detail of animation, not a moment is wasted to convey every range of emotion through acting. And 90% of the characters aren't even humans. I felt more connected to a robot with an eyeball and two fingers than I did with most of the human characters in this film. And that is something that is very precious.If that isn't enough, Wall-E at its roots is simply a ridiculously charming and beautiful film. I recommend it for everyone, and I'd have to say it's my most favorite Pixar film of all time. It's got a great message and is a wonderful escape from a lot of the frantic and often shallow animated features you see today.If you've lost faith in the animation world, let Wall-E bring it back to life.","

"stibjork","29 June 2008","WALL-E is a robot left on Earth to clean it up while the human race waits in space. Despite being a robot, however, WALL-E has developed a consciousness - he is curious and innocent as a child. Of course, being what seems like the only operational robot left, he also longs for companionship (...someone besides his pet cockroach).That's where EVE comes in, a robot probe sent from the humans in space to check whether or not Earth is again inhabitable. Once WALL-E sees EVE, he becomes smitten and will literally follower her anywhere on Earth... or even space.One can empathize with WALL-E, as he has been alone for what seems like the greater part of 700 years, toiling away at work with nothing but the comforts of his makeshift home to give him some small pleasures and distractions in life (although his morning sluggishness is due to his depleted power, we can't help but relate with those mornings WALL-E finds hard to get out of bed). When he sees the sleek, powerful EVE, it's quite understandable that he is captivated by her.EVE, on the other hand, is completely focused on work (her ""directive""). While we can see her personality come through when she enjoys the freedom of flying around upon her arrival, she is determined to fulfill her mission.The real love story starts to kick in here. The scenes of WALL-E trying to gain EVE's affection are both lovable and laughable. And when WALL-E brings EVE to his home to shelter the storm, he shows EVE all of the various things he collected, much like how a child would show another companion his playthings. EVE's sense of humor comes to light, and we start to see a connection between WALL-E and EVE.Still, when WALL-E shows EVE a plant he picked up, she realizes that her mission is accomplished, so she then ""hibernates"" and beacons the spaceship to pick her up. WALL-E, though, doesn't realize what she has done when she shuts herself down - he is confused, and thinking that she's solar-powered like himself, he brings her outside to the sunlight. His concern and care for her in the rainstorms shine through, and he also dresses her up in lights when he shows her the beautiful sunset she can't see.When the spaceship picks up EVE, WALL-E follows suit, wanting to protect her but still not realizing what is going on. Once they dock on the AXIOM ship, WALL-E gets into more trouble, being a fish out of water.EVE initially looks down on WALL-E - he's, of course, an older model who's job is just a trash compactor. Her attitudes can be seen on Earth where she initially ignores his attempts to gain her attention. Her desire to protect WALL-E arises not from love but more from a sense of noblesse oblige - even though WALL-E would follow EVE anywhere, she tries to make WALL-E understand that he has to go back to Earth alone, echoing WALL-E's interaction with his ever-present pet cockroach back on Earth.When WALL-E is locked in a space capsule that is set to explode, EVE again tries to save WALL-E. Luckily, he was able to get out of the situation himself, and they meet in space. WALL-E used what he learned of a fire extinguisher on Earth (a hilarious scene) to propel him - here, we see EVE and WALL-E as equals in a beautiful dance of flight around the spaceship.More and more, we see EVE start to care deeply for EVE, and it's not only because he's cute and funny but also because he is unselfish and caring. When the captain asks EVE to show recordings of her time on Earth in order to see the state the planet is in, the recording is left on, and EVE then sees the care WALL-E has taken of her during her hibernation. Also, WALL-E risks his life to protect the plant, not because he cares so much the plant but because he knows how much fulfilling her directive means to EVE. He would do anything for EVE, and, in turn, EVE starts to develop the same feelings towards WALL-E.The two endure various calamity to help the spaceship return to Earth, but WALL-E becomes a casualty in the process. EVE finds replacement parts and fixes WALL-E, but he is not the same - he is only focused on his work, a reversal of roles from the beginning of the film. However, EVE holds WALL-E's hands and ""kisses"" him with a spark, and his memory awakens....It's just amazing to me how all of this is conveyed in the storytelling. The characters' expressions and actions are limited to their eyes and gestures of their hands, yet that seems to be more than enough for the artists of the film to express the character's emotions in a visual manner. Each robot can't but say each other's names, yet their bond comes through without any dialogue - in fact, just the tone of their voice when calling each other's names gives all of the information about their intent or feelings at that moment.In any love story, it's not a trivial task to express both sides - oftentimes, unrequited love 'magically' becomes true love after a single event, when the object of the affection suddenly has their eyes opened. On the other hand, WALL-E provides the viewer with a believable love story where both characters come alive and whisk you away in their universe. It's nothing short of extraordinary....Of course, to say that ""WALL-E"" is a perfect love story is a miscategorization, as it offers a perfect blend of comedy, action, and suspense, along with so many other interwoven messages and jewels - it's just a perfect story, period.","

"jordathan","30 June 2008","i had high expectations with this film, as it is written and directed by Andrew Stanton, who helmed ""Finding Nemo,"" my personal favorite Pixar film. i was not disappointed.who knew an animated film with so little dialogue could keep you so engrossed in the story? you have to hand it to the guys at Pixar, they know what they're doing and they do it well. as always, they are able to imbue the least human of characters with humanity, infusing them with personality, warmth, humor, and empathy. in fact, the robots of this film may be more human than the humans.the animation has never been better, so startling are the visuals, and Thomas Newman delivers yet another incredible score. what makes this film different than the other Pixar movies is that it doesn't only carry the usual life-lesson moral with it, but also proclaims a social message to where we are now as humans and our reliance on technology and material possessions, and our apathy towards what we are doing to the precious planet we live on.the film only misfires a tad when the humans begin to have a bigger part of the plot, but the rest of the film is so great, it mostly makes up for this. this should easily be one of the best films of the year.","

I must say after seeing it that I wasn't letdown either overall it was pretty impressive work everything from graphics to the style of it's story with the fantasy characters living in cool settings. Starting in a rusty desert of junk where the only living thing that moves is square robot ""WALL-E"" who has such catchy and droopy binocular eyes. Much of the first parts of the film we see the robot as stubborn and alone as the action and journey of discovery doesn't really take off till he meets up with a landed spaceship and another ray eyed robot ""EVE"". This movie is clearly a film of discovery a new type of journey that involves future themes of space and saving humans with the central hero being a robot a lifelike possibility with the technology of the future as machines and droids may soon rule the planet.

"zactac","7 February 2010","Wall-e is purely innocent fun that anyone will just love. This is a movie that can stimulate a child's imagination while getting through to the young at heart.In Wall-e we meet a robot whose job is to clean up trash. It's several hundred years into the future and Earth is void of all human life. As the world became more devastating by pollution, what remained of human-kind left Earth on an intergalactic cruise ship. For hundreds of years Wall-e has been cleaning up waiting for the day that his curious mind can be settled. He watches old videos and musicals which gets him to think about something more, love. Then a probe named Eve comes down from the ship looking for something and then they both meet. As Wall-e shows Eve how fun it is to be a free spirit she leaves. As Wall-e follows her into space they both go on an adventure that could change the fate of mankind forever.Seeing this movie is almost like seeing a modern day silent film. The main characters in the movie don't talk (except for the noises they make) which makes the movie even more fun to watch. The Wall-e character is so funny and adorable you just can't help yourself but to say ah from how cute he is. Even when he's getting hit by something you just can't help but to laugh and say ah while feeling bad for him because he's such a lovable character. This is the movie families, children, adults, even teenagers can love without feeling any kind of regret.","

I can just give this a 9/10 just because of their chemistry and the 2nd half is full of action and incredibly charming, entertaining scenes. And you can kind of see EVE leaning towards WALL-E throughout the runtime away from her missions and the captain standing up with bravery and courage is such a powerful scene and the ending is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

"doctorsmoothlove","13 July 2008","What would it be like to be the last person on Earth? Fortunately, no one knows, but many filmmakers have attempted to answer this ephemeral question. As recently as last year, another film with this premise I am Legend was released, but the film played as a traditional save-the-world video game-style movie with minuscule intellectual appeal. It didn't answer any questions about what living in solitude is like, despite its more mature content. Pixar, however, has created Wall-E to satiate our boundless post-apocalyptic questions while still containing the action sequences of I am Legend. It's an adventurous work for Pixar, as the studio has not released a science fiction film or a film with mute (or mostly mute) protagonists. Fortunately for Pixar, their effort has created a beautiful film that is more adult-oriented than their previous eight works.The film opens with bird's eye low-angle shots of a dystopian Earth. Everything is abandoned and no humans are visible. As the camera moves closer to the surface, the remnants of urban life are shown. Skyscrapers abound, but are they really skyscrapers? Upon closer inspection, we see that they are just cubes of garbage stacked on top of each other. Then we see WALL-E, the engineer of the garbage towers. It (or rather he) is a trash-compacting robot and is the only sentient creature on the planet. He spends his days processing trash and returns to a makeshift home each night with trinkets he finds. He is particularly fond of a cassette tape of Hello Dolly! that he watches every night. One day another robot comes to Earth via a huge spacecraft and Wall-E tries to bond with her (the gender identity of the robot is obvious). He brings her to his home and learns that her name is EVE (no points for deciphering that reference). WALL-E shows her a plant which he has found and she deactivates. Wall-E humorously tries to impress his now deactivated charge in Hello Dolly! style but doesn't have much luck.Wall-E's new companion is kidnapped by her old spacecraft and he follows her. What he discovers is a floating ""cruise ship"" of human life. Overweight and pampered creations devoid of any human qualities fill the spaceship which floats endlessly through space. These people sit all day in a mobile armchair and are fed by robots. Even the children enjoy this lifestyle (which makes me wonder how they even exist). None of the people are even bothered to learn the names of those around them. However, one person does resemble what we would call a human being. He is Captain B. McCrea (please draw no illusions of grandeur). The captain receives EVE and is flabbergasted to discover that she has returned with vegetation. This means that the Earth is now habitable for humanity (and apparently WALL-E's pet cockroach isn't indicative but who wants to live like a roach).But The autopilot feature of the spacecraft doesn't think that humans should ever return to Earth and retaliates against the Captain, EVE, and a clueless but infatuated WALL-E but its efforts are thwarted. WALL-E and EVE settle with the humans on the Earth and Disney's formulaic ending follows.Now, I've lead you to think that I won't recommend the film. This is homage to my cynicism rather than a deliberate attempt to fool you (I promise). My actual opinion is the opposite this sarcasm. WALL-E is a wonderful film. Not only is it a touching romance but also a good science fiction film. Ironically, for a Pixar film WALL-E is surprising dark but not just in its story but also its visuals. On Earth the colors are muted and different variations of brown. Where are the vibrant colors of Cars, Toy Story, or Monster's Inc.? They never appear. They provide an implicit sadness. While the people may return, the movie doesn't insure that this means their past won't reoccur which is presented in the endless drab colors.While the colors are unusual from Pixar, the tone is strange as well. WALL-E is the most cynical of all of Pixar's full-length works. Humanity has fled the Earth because it has devastated the landscape to the point where vegetation cannot grow. The film also offers a strong critique of consumerism. A single company (Buy n Large) is prominently displayed everywhere that WALL-E collects trash. The same company also designed the spacecraft where humanity currently resides. Additionally the people aboard the spacecraft (Axiom) make no efforts to improve their waste-elimination tactics. They just drop off trash into space. So what happens when they return to an already-decimated Earth? The film doesn't present an ending beyond the return to Earth but I challenge you to write the screenplay for the movie's sequel (which I hope is currently located in one of the trash cubes our protagonist has manufactured).Humanity itself is subject to intense critique not just in the ways I have described. The CGI people appear poorly rendered compared to WALL-E and EVE. They have a synthetic look, as if director Andrew Stanton wanted them to appear artificial. WALL-E, EVE, and the other robots look strikingly realistic. Furthermore, the humans not only lack polished appearance, but their emotions lack distinguishing qualities. No passion compels them to do anything. People do not speak to each other directly but via on screen video displays. This contrasts with WALL-E and EVE quite nicely. WALL-E is attached to EVE, maybe he loves her or maybe he seeks conscious companionship, it doesn't matter really. He innocently follows her wherever she goes as a child would his crush and his inability to speak further validates his commitment to her. EVE responds nonchalantly to his interest but warms up to him in the end. In WALL-E, the robots are more ""alive"" than the human beings to the point where we see the humans as the automatons and the robots as the characters worthy of our sympathy.Final Consensus: **** out of ****","

It's something that the everyone in the family can enjoy; and is well worth the 9 bucks I paid to see it.However......this movie probably shouldn't be in the top 250, let alone top 25. It's not even Pixar's best. Both of the two Toy Stories, AND Finding Nemo are better movies! They may not surpass WALL-E in animation, but they are better, and more original stories. Even the animation doesn't leave me in awe as it does so many others on IMDb apparently. It is repetitive, and lacks style in a way. An example would be ""scared"" WALL-E (even if you haven't seen the movie, you've seen it in previews). He just shakes! That would be OK, except he does it 3 or 4 times in the movie! Do something different! To add to that, both the story and music is basically stolen. 2001: a space odyssey, star trek, star wars; all stolen from.","

"pickle-92642","31 July 2021","Wow. This is easily Pixar's most timeless film, and will be relevant for generations to come. Such an incredible story that really makes you happy you're alive at this moment in time. Almost photo realistic animation, even though this came out in 2008. I'm having a very hard time ranking these Pixar films, since I've got like a 4 way tie between Cars, Monsters, Inc., Ratatouille, and this one. This is possibly Pixar's most visually stunning films along with Coco, which gives it a lot of points. A good word to use to describe this is magical. It's crazy how much BETTER Pixar is than EVERY OTHER ANIMATION COMPANY by a country mile. A solid 9.0/10 for me is an amazing score and probably gets into my Top 100, and I've given out like 7 of them for the first 9 Pixar films. They're just that good. WALL-E is no exception, and Pixar's genius win streak continues through 2008.","

"Jangobadass","2 July 2008","Pixar's newest film, ""Wall-E"", is sure to go down in history as animated masterpiece alongside the ""Toy Story"" duo, ""The Incredibles"", and ""Finding Nemo"".For starters, the animation is just gorgeous. Which is really saying something when the first part of the movie takes place world that is a barren, trash filled waste land. Unlike so many films from their animation rivals where everything is bright and crisp, the artists at Pixar always add real world textures to everything they make. Just think about the water in ""Finding Nemo"" or the food in ""Ratatouille"". While we are taken to a place where everything is smooth and well polished later, I was more impressed by how they were able to make everything dirty, rusty and dented...including our hero.Wall-E himself is one of the most lovable animated characters I've seen in years. Unlike so many ""whacky"", ""zany"" cartoon characters who are annoying, obnoxious and almost soulless, Wall-E is able to emote and make us like him without saying a word. Well, he does say a few words, but they're so few and far between he's practically a silent film star for the 21st century, wonderfully using his eyes, hand gestures, and body movements. The same can be said for Eve, the probe driod who steals his heart (or is it motor?). It is interesting to see them together just because they're so different: he's old (maybe even ancient), clunky, dented and dirty as a machine can be while still working while she's sleek, fast and brand new. The two of them make a good couple, first as a comedy duo with Wall-E as the clown and Eve as the straight man, then as friends, then as lovers. There is even a scene of them ""dancing"" in space which culminates with the robot equivalent of a kiss. The love story in ""Wall-E"" wonderfully accomplishes what so many romantic comedies try and fail to do, and I'm not even sure Pixar realizes it!I also really like the film's messages, which are ones we don't see very often and fairly bold. Most kids & family movies (including Pixar's previous works) use morals about friendship, family, honesty, being true to yourself, etc. There's nothing with that. In fact, it should a good way to impart some important information onto young viewers. But we've seen them all so many times those messages have lost some of their meaning. And sometimes those meanings tend to unfortunately get lost amid the slapstick, crude humor, action scenes, and pop culture references that much of today's family entertainment falls victim to. Not here. The first, most obvious message has to do with the environment: the Earth of the future is a barren garbage dump with no plants or water and Wall-E has made ""stacks"" of crushed and cubed garbage that are taller than sky-scrapers and the only animal we see is a lone cockroach.But the movie took me by surprise when it started to show us something about today's society. The story takes us to the giant spaceship Axiom where humanity now lives and here the human race has evolved into a race of pudgy, pampered people who sit in hover chairs and very rarely get out of them, have robots do every single thing for them except eat/drink ""food in a cup"" (all junk food, at that), talk to each other via holographic screens instead of face to face even when the person they're talking to is nearby, have no knowledge of their surroundings (they spend hours lounging by the pool without even realizing there is a pool there, let alone trying to swim) or history, and the corporation that built the ship (and ruined Earth) tells them what to do via ads in place of a government. The scary thing is that there are several eerie parallels between the society of the Axiom and the one here in the real world that make me wonder about the real fate of mankind.For the life of me, I can't think of a single flaw with ""Wall-E"". From the animation to the characters to the story, everything about it is so great I can't think of anything wrong with it. Not only will this be one of the best movies, animated or live action, of 2008, it will be one of the best movies of all time.","

Earth has become overridden by garbage and WALL.E is there to help Earth to be restored.WALL.E is all alone but he also has a cockroach to keep him company but something seems to be missing. Soon enough a ship comes to earth to see if there is still life on earth. A robot named Eva comes out to search and she runs into WALL.E. WALL.E takes an immediate liking to her and somehow their paths cross onto the ship that is supposed to come back someday to Earth when it's considered safe to do so.At some point the captain of the ship learns that Eva has brought back a plant and he knows that they can go back to Earth. The captain wants to go back and unfortunately his Auto Manual doesn't want him to and tries to sabotage him. Eventually the captain learns how to shut down the Auto Manual machine and they go back. Eventually at the end WALL.E and Eva find love. Sweet robot love.","

"palexandersquires","19 August 2008","This Is A Nice little story, But as my heading states this is a Warning to all of us, who live on this planet.Of how it will end up if we do not look after it. The Film's background colours are brown and grey, with brown skies. Wall-e does clear up and recycle all rubbish, but he will not be there to clear up after us. The colours only brighten up when we are taken aboard the sterile conditions of the Axion spaceship, and we meet the clean bot who says ""Forgien Contaminant"" and cleans it up. Unfortunately all of us, who migrated into space aboard the spaceship, have become fat and lazy. I like Eve and I think that she is sleek and very modern looking, I cannot blame Wall-e for becoming smitten with her! I also think that it was a good idea to reestablish B'N'L at the spaceship, I also do not mind having my meals brought to my chair. If I where on that spaceship, I would help the captain with the controls, instead of that George the auto pilot. I have got the music CD and the tunes are brilliant. I hope that when they release the DVD, they include the sketch with the magician and the hungry rabbit and the trouble he went through to get his carrot. Yes Pepole, this is how the earth will become in 700 years from now, if we do not do anything to keep our rubbish under control.Even the supermarket where I work will become like the BNL on earth seen at the beginning of this film, if we are not care full enough","

"Toph-22","17 January 2021","Seen Wall-E for the first time and was more than convinced. Superbly made animated movie that manages to stage a serious and real subject in such an appealing, simple and at the same time funny way.
You immediately establish an emotional connection to Wall-E and the entire environment. Machines are at the center. There you have difficulties to show facial expressions and gestures as extensively as with humans. But this movie succeeds in doing that.
Very little is spoken throughout the movie, but that doesn't affect the valence. The movie is not boring, nor do you feel like you lose information or you don't understand the overall plot or actions. The movie works a lot with the images shown and the soundtrack.
Wall-E respectively the mankind is on an odyssey in which the future way of life is in the center. In the process, they go through a new beginning and do a developmental step in evolution. '2001: A Space Odyssey' prepared for a different audience.","

"theVade","11 July 2017","There wasn't much to complain about this film. The storyline and way of storytelling was great, and the visuals weren't bad but the use of actual actors did take away from the immersion of the film. With all that being said, I decided to give WALL-E a ""Very Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 9 out of 10. This was honestly a great Pixar film, and like I said above, I think that this is one of the better Pixar movies I've seen in a long time. Let's hope that after Pixar's season of reboots we will have some original films like this one.Read more at theVade.","

"swlabr413","9 July 2008","When I first heard that there would be little to no actual dialogue in the first 40 minutes of Wall-E, I was skeptical. But then I remembered what is considered the greatest Science Fiction movie of all time (and as a matter of fact, AFI just named it that), 2001: A Space Odyssey. That also had almost no dialogue for the first 40 minutes. So my opinion changed and my view of the movie changed. I thought that Pixar was going to take a risk by doing this, and leave behind the typical kids movie. And the movie itself is not a typical kids movie. It passes as a very good Science Fiction movie as well as an animation movie because it gives us a scary look into the future, but done in a humorous way. Buy n' Large, which is obviously supposed to be Wal-Mart, takes over Earth in every way, economy and government. Soon, because they pollute the Earth so much, they have to send the human race out to space, and they'll have robots clean it up. Enter the title character. Wall-E is the last of his kind, and because he's been alone for so long, he develops a personality, collecting the trash and bringing them to his home. Soon Eve comes, and becomes Wall-E's love interest. When she discovers a plant, it's off to space. Again, Wall-E comments on society of today by showing how lazy we are coming and then at one point, all humans know how to do is sit in a hover chair and watch T.V., and drink meals from a cup. Wall-E of course brings light to not only the captain of the ship Axiom, but to a few passengers as well, who even though have lived their entire life upon the ship, failed to recognized they had a pool. But in the end, Wall-E isn't about trying to warn us about the future and what we will become. Above all, it is a love story, as most Disney movies are. But this one is one of the best, right up there with Beauty and the Beast, because it is a universal love story. The robots Wall-E and Eve don't necessarily speak a certain language, it is through their attitude and movements that they tell their love story. And of course being Pixar, it is an incredibly fun ride, with great funny moments (like the captain researching Earth). A truly great movie.","

"fklwr","1 February 2024","A new step in animation.Silence is something a lot of movies lack thinking that people won't be interested in a movie we're dialogue is limited, this proves everyone wrong. This is the peak of animation, not only does it look authentic and genuine it has a deep plot and realistic story that can relate to all of us no matter the age. This movie conveys how disconnected we as society have become to simple human traits like the connection to not only one another but to the land we stand on. It shows that we can't take the lush green world we live on for granted, we have to take care of it like we would each other. The films proves that not all kids movies have to be simple, they can be realistic, mature and still be engaging. Overall a movie worth everyone's time.","

"Dr_Coulardeau","7 August 2008","A lot of hullabaloo for nothing. Perfectly boring. What's more on a sensitive subject that is dealt with in such extreme terms that it becomes terroristic. Terroristically antipollution. Terroristically anti-obesity. Terroristically anti-machine and anti-corporation. And on the other side there are two robots who fall in love  ah ah ah I laugh, it is so romantic, the love of a piece of junk with another piece of junk  a cockroach who is definitely not heavy enough to re-balance the situation. A pathetic lack of imagination with even the Zarathustra of Strauss and the allusion to 2001, the Space Odyssey, an allusion that no kid can understand. Walt Disney is winking at the curators of the museum of cinematographic antiquities. In other words it can work in the US because they have no competition from the rest of the world YET. But they should really think twice next time now Spielberg is moving to Dubai and the Chinese are getting ready to take off.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines","

"abecip","9 December 2008","It took me a while to actually watch Wall-E. People told me it was boring, there wasn't much dialogue, etc., etc.So when I caught it at the tail end of its showing here in Manila a few months ago, I came in with the lowest of expectations, perhaps expecting at least the quality of animation I'm so used to seeing from Pixar as its only redeeming value.Turned out, I was wrong. Who would've thought that with little dialogue in the first third of the movie that this would actually turn out to be a richly done animated picture? While it didn't have many laughs like Kung Fu Panda or even Bolt, this picture shows that love and hope can come from anywhere at anytime. Of course, it's balanced, well-paced and it has its share of laughs.Wall-E the protagonist (he reminds me of that Short Circuit robot from the 80's movies with Steve Guttenburg) is a unique robot. He has feelings, he's sentimental, and he's a collector of old memorabilia and interesting stuff. Plus he still does his business taking out the trash and even using the junk to make replicas of buildings. Cool.Visually stunning from beginning to end, Wall-E is a masterpiece of animation and directing. In fact, the movie has a rich detail in the portraying of Earth in the distant future as well as providing an imaginative perspective of how Earthlings could have evolved given a certain path taken. That was very interesting as well.Mostly, the movie portrays a message of hope. It may seem preachy, bringing to mind a similar animated flick in Happy Feet, but it's portrayed in such a way that it's acceptable to hear and you say to yourself, ""yeah... that's right."" It's got a level that can appeal to adults as well, and it's different than many of the things we see and consider as ""entertainment."" There are countless awesome (animated) movies that I've seen through the years, but Wall-E is so different that it's got to be included in my personal collection of worth-collecting DVD's. Truly an extraordinar-E movie made by Pixar. You've got to see it!","

The Extra-Terrestrial. I have seen many outstanding motion pictures since then, but none have ever captured the pure sweetness, joy and magic of that film. And to be honest with you, I always figured that no movie ever could.I'm delighted to report that I was wrong.Seeing WALL-E on opening night, in a packed theater in which every single person in the auditorium applauded at the end for close to 5 minutes...well, let's just say I have a little more faith in humanity than I did before.(I would also like to add that this is a PERFECT date movie...)","

"WhatsYourPoint","30 June 2008","The past decade of films have seen its fair share of fads; from big-budget fantasy movies and comic book adaptations to a multitude indie films, this era of cinema is rife with them.However, maybe the biggest current one is the computer-animated movie. And as the undisputed king of this, Pixar constantly pushes the envelope for this young genre. Yet, even after stating this, no one could have expected what they did with their newest film.They created art.Pixar's 2008 contribution is ""WALL-E,"" a fish out of water story about a cute and cuddly robot who finds himself in love, and unknowingly, carrying the torch for humanity's future. Sounds generic.Well, that's why plot synopses never do the film justice! This is the case with ""WALL-E."" The plot's purpose is to bring us to a beautiful, yet ugly, world where humanity has lost its way. The film tackles such subjects as consumerism, environmentalism, America's fast-food culture, and our increasing dependence on technology. With this list of themes, I might as well be talking about an Oliver Stone movie.Thank God I am not; Oliver Stone could never produce something as good as ""WALL-E"" (""Platoon,"" you don't stand a chance). Man, this catapults the kids movie into art. There are so many beautiful images, like WALL-E scraping Saturn's rings as if they were water or WALL-E and his mate flying in space locked in a romantic helix.Furthermore, even the structure is somewhat unconventional. There is little dialog, especially in the first part. And there are really no overt villains, as the film tries to point out that humanity is really its own worst enemy (it's not cheesy like ""Dawn of the Dead""'s take on this concept). Sure, there is a happy ending, and clichés show up once in awhile, but the movie is so awe-inspiring in its execution and its message that it doesn't matter.If I told you my least favorite genre in moviedom, I might tell you that kids' movies are at the top of my list. ""WALL-E"" doesn't change my mind on this, but it does give me hope that the genre will actually try to become more than poor dialog, unbearable storytelling, and most of all, flagrant bathroom humor. Pixar's new outing not only gives one hope for the family film, but for all movies in general.A pop film can be art.","

"nikibabs","16 October 2009","I could not wait to see this movie when it was coming out. I was never so excited to see a movie before, and well I saw it opening day and.... I LOVED IT! This movie has so much charm, humor, excitement, adventure, and most importantly, heart. I can not recommend this movie more, it has got to be the best computer-animated movie I've ever seen. Also, this movie is for adults too since it had a deep plot about the end of the world. So to tell you the truth, I think parents and other grown-ups might enjoy it more than regular kids, but of course kids will enjoy it as well. If you enjoyed all of Pixar's other films, you will no doubt enjoy this heartwarming adventure about love and betrayal.","

"symphonyofnames","30 June 2008","In lieu of a plot, this movie has a series of plot holes strung together, which all get overlooked on the premise if it being a kids' movie. This was not as great as everyone is making is out to be. I don't know why everyone has picked this particular Disney Pixar movie to make a stink about. The humor was nothing new; it's the same stuff they've been doing for years. They did start off with some good ideas. These ideas, unfortunately, were not developed nearly as thoroughly as they should have been. The first part of the movie features Wall-E rolling around doing nothing in particular, and some superfluous shots of a cockroach. When EVE's ship takes off, I was sitting in the theater, hoping and praying that Wall-E would get on it, as I watched everything that could be vaguely interesting in the movie try to fly away. What happened up in the ship wasn't much better though, so I don't know why I wasted time hoping. The focus was taken off of what could have been the real message of the movie: a commentary about how the corporate world and our increasingly leisure-filled lifestyle will one day destroy the planet and leave everyone in space. This is not a particularly new or original idea, and certainly not as brilliantly demonstrated as someone like Orwell or Huxley has already already done. The focus of the movie was taken off of this, and put onto a cutesy little romantic story about two robots who chase after the film's Macguffin (a plant). This really should have been more of a subplot. I felt like a lot of things could have been cut out without really changing the movie at all; a lot of mishaps the main characters face aren't really pertinent to the story at all. For example: the plant is taken away by a bad robot. The film's characters chase after it, invoking a lot of slap-stick comedy. And then, just when they get close to their goal, THE SAME THING HAPPENS. It's not needed. I felt like if they wanted to really make a point, they should have made their point and not tried to dumb it down. It works well as a kid's movie, but I really don't think it's any better than any of the other animated movies about robots, or fish, or animals that they've done before. Just my take on it.","

"PizzicatoFishCrouch","7 August 2008","It's several hundred years into the future and grubby little Wall.E is the last remaining robot on Earth, programmed to collect garbage around the world. By now the Earth has become such an unliveable mass of scum and debris that the humans had vacated the planet long ago, shirking responsibility for the mess they made to live it large in space.Wall.E's only company is a little cockroach that follows him about, until one day a spaceship lands in his vicinity, bringing with it Eve, a high-tech, no-nonsense pod robot that has been programmed to search for traces of life on Earth. Wall.E spies on Eve, and he is in turns bewildered and bewitched by her, but the principle emotion he feels toward her is love. So much love, in fact, that when the spaceship comes back to take Eve back, he follows his Goddess onto the 'ship and it takes them to where all the humans have relocated; floated around in Space and with no intention of going home.Any initial doubts I had about whether Pixar could pull off a futuristic robot movie were immediately quashed when we were introduced to the enigmatic robot himself. Wall.E's existence is a mundane one; forcing rubbish into cube after cube, which he piles together to make towers of rubbish, but he finds pleasures in the household items he encounters  a spoon, a light, a bra. Back in his ""home""  an upturned schoolbus he resides in, he gathers together all the items he collects, and falls asleep Hello, Dolly!, from which he becomes particularly fascinated with the act of holding hands, and wishes he has someone to do it with.The romance between Wall.E and Eve is believable (yes, believable!) and poignant; I had tears in my eyes when he was tending to her and holding an umbrella to shield her from the rain, even though it resulted in himself getting electrocuted. Though the film is about robots (humans don't feature until the second half, and even then they are just fat rolls operating electrical chairs, a sad reminder of where our society is headed) and the only words exchanged by the two leads are each others' names, this is one of the must ""humane"" movies I have ever seen, with a lot of soul.Beauty dominates practically every frame. The initial scenes of Wall.E captured the desolate, crumbling state of Earth, but Pixar has found loveliness in the most unexpected of places. This is Pixar's most ambitious movie to date, and the landscapes and details are appropriately cinematic (the planet is captured with such meticulous pans and fade-outs that it feels almost Shawshank Redemptionly, no real surprise when we consider that Roger Deakins worked as a visual consultant on the movie). Another filmmaker who helped make The Shawshank Redemption the masterpiece that it was, Thomas Newman, also contributed to Wall.E, and his score, whilst not matching his personal best of the other Pixar movie he wrote for, Finding Nemo, still ranks as one of his best, particularly in his usage of the harp, which lends an otherworldly feel to the film throughout.(Ahem. Sorry for all the references to The Shawshank Redemption here.) My only qualm with Wall.E is that there isn't enough humour in the movie. In a way, this is Pixar's darkest movie to date; with its messages about society's need to wake up to the problem of global pollution, commercialism, mass obesity and whatnot. The cheeky filmmakers even managed to slip in their own message to Disney; when the president in the old clip says ""stay in the course."" But all this means that, whilst there's the odd visual gag or two, Wall.E is not really all that funny, with no definite belly laughs. With last year's Ratatouille also failing to tickle my funny bones, I worry that Pixar are becoming darker and darker these days, and leaving the comedic roots that served them so well in the past.However, despite the fact that I cried more than I laughed, Wall.E still gets a resouding thumbs up from me. The animation is flawless, the entertainment is countless and for once, I became interested in sci-fi. And the denouement shows that it's not too late; redemption is still available and we can still save the world if we really want to.","

"ElijahCSkuggs","27 June 2008","It's so clear. So painfully clear that Pixar Studios are making the absolute best movies out there. Each and every time I see a one of their new movies, I come out of it with such a happy and vibrant feeling. And with Wall-E, the results are the same. Maybe even more so.Wall-E is about a little trash compacting and collecting robot whose sole directive is to clean up Earth. And I'll tell you something, he's fantastic at his job. With his little cockroach pal at his side, the two are the only living and functioning things on planet Earth. One day while Wall-E's about to finish up work, a rocket ship lands, and out emerges an impressive little white robot whose purpose is to search for vegetation. What follows from their initial and humorous meetings is what great stories are made of.Wall-E is superb film-making and story-telling at the family level. Hell, it's fantastic on all levels. With humor, emotion and adventure ruling the day, this Pixar gem surely is a must-see film. I know these Pixar films may seem kiddie, but this is pure family gold. Adults will laugh at the satire and be re-energized by the genuine love story. If I'm not making myself clear, this is an unbelievable flick. And if you have any spare time, go out and see Wall-E. It's perfect entertainment.","

The movie has barely a word spoken in the first 30 minutes, but tells a story so touching and so innocent it leaves you breathless. The first half is transcendent. Although WALL-E is a robot composed of assorted metals, he is anything but lifeless. I was really surprised at the quality and depth of the movie. This is not your ordinary children's cartoon by any stretch of the imagination. I can not say that I highly recommend it, but it is worth watching once.","

"blackmamba99971","2 July 2008","This film has to be the most artistic representation of robots i have ever seen. The mixture of emotions running deep inside two of the most heroic pair, Eve and Wall-e. Pixar has done it again with this magical film, showing us a lone robot wall-e which stands for waste allocation load lifter. Being the only robot on earth to clean up a mess which humans had created over a period of a few centuries only to leave the planet so it can be cleaned by wall- e. Except an unexpected turn of events catapult him into space to an earth ship drifting on auto pilot, chasing down his beloved eve, which has found a plant, evidence that the humans can go back and start over. The duo then becomes closer than any human can resulting in a kindred love for each other and how they protect both each other and the humans from a rogue misfit auto pilot who wants nothing to do with the plant evidence. Only to keep the humans enslaved forever, never to return to earth. But as we all know these two lovable robots will not let anything stand in the way of change. This film made me laugh horrendously and nearly cry for the emotional tugs of how wall-e and eve connect so deeply with each other. They are different in shape and functions yet they bond so well and work together as one, that nothing is impossible as the auto pilot kept saying to himself. But it goes to show us on how quickly our earth can go in the crapper in such little time, and the only ones who we could depend on is with one small robot who collects nick nacks and lighters for a hobby and use them to his advantage. his independence walloped the more high tech gadgets and showed the humans and robots alike that heroism runs deep, no matter if it's circuits and batteries or blood and bone, and his sacrifice to do the right thing saved humanity. Eve on the other hand is his soul mate in the electronic world and without her, the kids of the earth could not learn the meaning of love,life,and caring about the ones you would die for. Everyone can learn from wall-e and eve. Hats off to pixar, thank you for giving us a most memorable film to date. And i hope you guys win some Oscars.",NA
"LupinsGal2004","20 July 2008","This was an excellent movie. It will make any one of any age laugh, tear up, laugh some more. And the subtle messages will make you think.I really enjoyed this movie as a 31 year old woman (no kids) I even liked the opening magic/bunny cartoon.One thing I think is off...Hello Dolly and Michael Crawford have such pivotal roles in the movie that Jerry Herman (the composer) and Michael Crawford (Seen Singing ""it only takes a moment"") Should have been credited. I didn't see them in the end credits or on this site. (Granted I didn't sit through the WHOLE credits. So maybe they were closer to the end)I'll have to check if they are near the end when I buy it on DVD.Yes, this is worth adding to your DVD collection! Highly recommended! Solid A",NA
"popejobs","27 June 2008","My reaction to the early TV trailers for WALL-E was ""ok, another Pixar movie. No biggie."" Consider, though I've seen almost every Pixar movie (girlfriend renting them on DVD) my reactions ranged from ""mildly amused"" to ""cute, but mostly CGI eye-candy"". Of course, as a thirty-something male, I never assumed Pixar movies were targeted to my demographic in the first place. ""Pixar is for kids"", after all, right? Then one day a 5-minute sneak peak was shown on TV featuring WALL-E and Eve (scene where he gets stuck in space capsule with plant). During those 5 minutes, the essence of WALL-E's character took hold and never let go. My girlfriend and I decided we wouldn't be able to wait any longer than opening day to see it. Embarrassing to admit, but I go the theater twice in a year at most, and yet I actually bought our WALL-E tickets 2 weeks in advance.Having seen the movie today, he's honestly no less than the most adorable and brilliant animated character of all time. His personality and mannerisms spread themselves like sunlight - turning even the coldest of hearts to liquid, and bursting preconceptions to dust. Until now, no character (fictional or otherwise) ever managed to awaken the kid in me with the old notion ""I wish this character was real so I could take it home with me"". The way this movie ends is the same way it begins: at the core it's all about WALL-E and the things we recognize in him as inherently human: his funny personality, his compulsion toward the good, his child-like curiosity and naivety, his sense of loneliness that he tries (and fails) at anesthetizing with psychological comforts and companion place-holders. All of the film's characters other than WALL-E are really just props, like arrows pointing your attention back at him, and always when it's the last thing he would want. His plant also seems symbolic of him (and that will make sense after you've seen the movie).All that aside, the graphics are brilliant, especially the WALL-E character, in that it looks like a real physical robot shot on film. Great care was taken on subtleties like focus/defocus and depth perception to make him look real-world, all *within* a real-world (especially the scenes during which he's alone on earth).I wish it would've been longer, but only because like all great rides, it went by fast and eventually had to have an end. Can't wait to see it again.",NA
"victor7754","2 July 2008","WALL-E captivates the senses during the first 20 minutes as computer generated images of our future look and feel life like. A loneliness creeps in and engulfs the mind as WALL-E wheels his way around a decaying metropolis, in silence doing his job as a scrap recycler constructor. Many films in recent times have applied the spirit and machine together such as A.I., I Robot, 2001, and Aaron Lipstadt's obscure 1982 film Android. There may be a future in robotics as the Human population rises and our needs change. Investors look out.This Pixar/ Disney production is a wonder to view as we watch WALL-E pursue companionship in a space visitor, a Droid Robot named EVA sent to the barren earth to find plant life. The arrival of the spaceship as it descends upon the desolate city is beautiful and enjoyably felt. There is a Genesis feel to EVA's arrival as she represents Eve in the Garden and WALL-E is Adam. God even saw in a robot, loneliness. The discovered plant represents the fig leaf and the space ship is the Ark. Disney and Christianity have always been hand in hand.The second half of the film becomes more Disney as we meet the Inhabitants on the Spaceship. A sadness may come upon the mind as the inhabitants are a future generation of WALL-Mart consumers continuing the game deep in Space. The Earth was gobbled up and left a wasteland by corporate consumers apathetic to the world around them. Who will lead them without ego back to earth. WALL-E? No. Love. Just as Christ represents love. Disney takes the same old story and paints another unique and original piece of art.WALL-E seems to be telling us that the human race needs to come together and hold hands and save this planet. It aims at the next generation, today's 5 to 10 year olds who will always have the future of our planet on their minds.WALL-E is fun, entertaining, unusual, alarming and contains some amazing images of a computer generated reality. That right there is frightening as the same generation may be deceived in the future when they think they are looking at something real when its just Pixar tricking the consumer into consumption.",NA
"H_Spengler","11 January 2009","Because nothing else about this movie is likable. I said it about Ratatouille and i'll say it again for this movie. After such amazing films as ""Finding Nemo"", ""Monster's Inc."" and ""Cars"", I thought I could depend on Pixar for a great story, engaging characters and top notch animation, here, as with Ratatouille only one third makes it....the animation!!After hearing all the hype about this for months and months, I rented it out. This has to be one of the dullest movies i've seen in a long time. Worker robot (Wall E) who trash compacts alone on the pollution scorched Earth(which by the way, how successful is he working by himself on a whole PLANET?!!) becomes lovestruck with robot scanner droid sent to find vegetation. He spends the duration of the movie in pursuit of said Scanner Droid (Eve). A ROBOT LOVE story? Give me a break! Robots do just what they're programmed to do, they lack emotions, or even the capacity to feel or develop them. At least offer me a reason why a robot would have emotions, especially a trash compacting worker bot.The movie is so dull, boring and repetitive that I was actually shocked. Aside from that the not so subtle hit you over the head concepts of ""pollution is bad, and we need to act now."" Humans are also fat lazy, slobs who look like large doddling infants having grown morbidly obese with lack of mobility. Aside from the herd of humans, the only other characters are the aforementioned robots and a couple of other late in the movie robot sidekicks. None of them manage to be interesting, and I honestly could care less what happened to ANY of them. Wall E himself, i'll have to admit is interesting looking. If ""Johnny 5"" from the ""Short Circuit"" series and ""Herb"" the dish-washing robot from the underrated ""Robots"" movie, had a child, it would look like Wall E. ""Eve"" reminds me of a Japanese toy robot. Overall I really can't complain animation wise.Both robots barely speak more than their own names, or each others names throughout the film. It really grates on your nerves after a while. Anyhow, I guess besides the not to subtle ""green"" plot, the whole point is for ""Eve"" to bring back a seedling/weed to a giant spaceship filled with the obese humans, so they can go and return to the now ""clean"" Earth. Wall E, of course inadvertently becomes part of this plot when his love sickness causes him to hitch a ride on the ship carrying Eve to the large spaceship. There's some crap about the ""auto pilot"" not wanting to return to the Earth despite the captain's orders (BTW-do any other 80's nerds think that the ""auto pilot"" looks like ""Max"" the pilot robot from ""Flight of the Navigator?"") Good of course triumphs as the human pilot and the robots win, and are taken back to Earth. Of course when they get there Earth is not renewed completely as it still is filled with cubes of scrap and some scattered weeds/seedlings. I felt like standing up and saying. ""Yeah, you thought it was gonna be like in the pictures didn't you?!!"" With how morbidly obese they appear it'd be a miracle if they were able to help with restoration at all! Besides, with all the mysterious dust storms that were seen over the course of the movie, how the hell did those vulnerable seedlings even survive?! Here are the things I liked about the movie: Sigourney Weaver's voice, John Ratzenberger's obligatory Pixar cameo, and Wall E's pet roach who believe it or not is the best character in the movie. The only time I laughed when it was something roach related. Kids are probably to young to appreciate the subtle humor ""factoids"" about the almost indestructibleness of the roach. This little guy is squashed or vaporized at least 3 times and just gets right back up, brushes off and continues like nothing happened (pretty much like a real roach.) Also, I didn't fail to notice that on apocalyptic Earth seemingly the only things to survive would be roaches and twinkies (both probably very true!) Giving 3/10 for animation, and the roach/twinkie thing. In the meantime i'll keep my fingers crossed for the old Pixar formula on their next venture.",NA
"annahudak-70828","8 July 2021","Look, I don't like romance movies. They're not for me. But I like this one. WALL-E is adorable. I found myself rooting for him, for the most part. There were a few moments I found his over-eagerness for EVE to be annoying, mainly when he got them in trouble. But, WALL-E has heart, which is weird to say about a robot. The charming nature of WALL-E's love for EVE is too much to ignore and made me fall in love with this movie. It's great and one of the few Disney/Pixar films I actually like.",NA
"Ryan_Barbakins","15 February 2020","WALL-E is damn near perfect. I have never felt such emotional attachment for robots than when I watch this movie. Every character has a distinct personality while being a robot. The sound mixing is stellar considering they had to create these abstract sounds to represent the deepest parts of imagination. The story is super easy to follow even though most of the characters are limited to making random robotic noises as dialogue. In fact the first 30 minutes of the film are played out like a silent film.
Many complain that this film should have gone 100% with the silent aspect, and while I do see where they are coming from, I feel like the plot didn't have much elsewhere to go if they had just stayed on earth. There also seem to be many complaints about the environmental preachy-ness. I honestly never found it overpowering, in fact I felt that the love story prospered overall as the main part of the film.",NA
"jakebunker","10 July 2023","Dare I say it, I believe this to be possibly the most overrated Pixar movie. Let me explain:First off, I can't deny this part: the beginning half hour is actually very well done. Silent storytelling at its best. Wall-E and his partner Eve are introduced in very natural and loving ways, and it does it all without needing to be too overbearing, leading to Wall-E, who has unfortunately had little socialization and action lately, to board the ship and begin its adventure.This is where the quality of the movie dips. Allow me to tell you why.I'm personally not a fan of movies that I call ""shenanigan movies."" Monsters, Inc. Is also one of these which is why I also feel it is overrated, but it isn't done nearly as hard as Wall-E. What I'm getting at here is this: the story is over as soon as the plant is put in that container thingamajig. Seems simple, right? No, because we have to look at everything the ship has to offer and because Wall-E has to free robots that cause chaos and has to get stuck in a capsule and has to nearly die from a trash ejector and all this stuff. The movie should be over sooner rather than later, but it takes nearly an hour for things to wrap up when it should take twenty minutes. By this point the main focus of the story is on the captain of the ship and not very much about Wall-E. This is why I call it a ""shenanigan story,"" because things can't be wrapped up right away; there's a runtime that needs to be reached. Basically I lose interest because the story is going nowhere except when the captain is on screen.This isn't to say it wasn't well-made; I can tell a lot of care and love went into it. It just isn't worth my energy to watch over and over when I have a better time with other Pixar movies. I'm glad people enjoy this movie, but this just isn't for me. I would rate it lower, but the movie is actually pretty well-crafted and has good quality overall. And the first half-hour is actually good.",NA
"badajoz-1","1 October 2009","A refreshing surprise - a film that takes its own path and does not rely too heavily on cliché, references and violence. The start with little dialogue is brave, the animation good, and the story gathers you in. Some cute gags about the last robot left on Earth just carrying on doing his job, until alien probes begin to look around! A touch too sentimental in parts like old time Disney, but the plot whisks along. An excellent touch is that the humans, who finally get a look in some time in, all look alike and are obese, while the robots are generally very distinguishable. The plot is the same as 'Logan's Run' and the thriller denouement is '2001' but it still does not disappoint as familiarity creeps in over the last 15 minutes. good, no very good.",NA
"Keyska2004","15 November 2010","This is definitely a coming of age movie, but we are allowed to witness it as humans on the outside of the romantic interlude. I absolutely love this film, I have seen it a couple of dozen times already. Wall-e is in all of us, the simple little person in us who lives in wonder of everything around us. I have spent the last 30 years working at a waste-water plant, a profession that others look down on, like our little hero who does a job that is needed. I relate to it with no reservations. His simple joys and his pain of unfilled love affects us all. Eve is the dream boat of his imagination - totally perfect except for one minor thing, her atomic gun which she uses to easily. The space trip is beautifully done with just the right amount of humor intertwined in it. You can't help but appreciate the time and details that went into this film, I even like it that we humans are shown in less detail (fat with low bone structure). If you have held back from watching this film, grab a bowl of popcorn, turn off the lights, turn up the volume and enjoy a great movie that will take you back to the time of warm-hearted Disney film classics that we all loved.",NA
"DJMo","22 December 2008","Unlike other Pixar films, I went into this one knowing next to nothing about the characters or storyline. I was absolutely floored. The film reminded me of Kubrick's '2001' and Chaplin's 'City Lights' and 'Modern Time' with Wall-E as the cute Chaplinesque robot on a mission of self-discovery and love. Eve is the perfect foil / robot love interest (whose design was allegedly influenced by the iPod). How often can a film, much less an animated film, mesh romantic silent film with sci-fi, consumerist satire, and post-apocalyptic dark comedy all in one? Sure, the ""humans are slobs"" motif is a bit heavy-handed, but I suppose our society deserves the wake-up call, subtle or not. 'Wall-E' is hands-down the greatest animated film ever made.",NA
"mrusty5","1 September 2009","What can be said about Wall-E? It is a masterpiece. One of Pixar's best films, only beaten by Toy Story and Finding Nemo, and perhaps Monsters Inc. Wall-E doesn't have much talk in it until the second half, but it is very emotional from beginning to end and shows various ways to display emotion and tell a story without having to speak all the way through.The film features Wall-E, a lonely trash-removing robot and the only thing alive on Earth aside from his pal cockroach, as all of humanity having left to travel the stars - we covered the planet in trash and left, just like that! Anyway, Wall-E has his own weird little world and longs for some company or something along those lines. He gets his wish when EVE, a shiny streamlined robot who is in search of plant life on Earth. She is basically an Apple iPod, Wall-E is a rusty Mac III, so its old meets new. The two share a charming bond which grows throughout the film. EVE eventually finds a plant which ironically Wall-E has and she sort of shuts down until a spaceship picks her up, Wall-E hitching along for the ride.There's a wonderful scene here where Wall-E floats through space on EVE's ship, it's quite magical and spectacular. The two eventually arrive in the second half of the film on a large space cruiser which comically looks like an actually cruise ship attached to rockets. The film's primary plot kicks in at this point but the relationship between Wall-E and EVE remains a plot point throughout the remainder of the film and the ending is beautiful in its own right.Great stuff.",NA
"evandewangga97","6 October 2013","So, first time I watched WALL·E is when my age was about 11 years old at the mountain's slope with my environmental community. It was the perfect night with such a nearly perfect movie. WALL·E is a message to children so that the children understand how fragile the earth is. It is a complex yet complicated message, but Andrew Stanton can make it simple and easy to understand. You know, for animation movie, this film is a revolution. Usually, animation movie's content is more or less about friendship, adventure, or fantasy. But, this movie change my perception of animation. The whole ""go green"" ideas are summarize by this 98-minute-motion-picture. At last, I'm waiting for quality animation like WALL·E again.I hope that the new generation of children would be entertained by movie like this again.",NA
"moviefanintheusa","4 October 2009","Have you also noticed that Pixar still hasn't made one bad movie yet? I've liked all the Pixar movies, and this is the best one yet. It seems weird that people actually make things like this in Maya. Amazing actually. The message that I think was behind this movie was really good as well. A robot left behind and forgotten about cleaning up the Earth for 700 years and the only friend he has is a cockroach. Well I guess that he doesn't have very much else to do anyway. The animation was amazing. Some parts of the movie looked almost real. I went to the cinema and saw this twice and bought the DVD. That's how good I thought it was. Once again, good work Pixar.",NA
"Theodorum","25 April 2018","I've always had a problem with computer animations, even in the early stages. With very few exceptions, they all look the same and follow the same ideas and patterns. Of course, the major problem is that they're keep coming, and getting more and more duller.
The graphics are simply not appealing to me; 3D computer generated animations simply lack emotions and depth. They might be on the right side of the uncanny valley, but there's still a problem with textures and facial expressions - eerily cold and somehow mechanic expressions. Hand-drawn animations are clearly more expressive, with natural movements and more spontaneity. This adds a warm touch to the overall atmosphere.
Now, for plot ideas and jokes; everything is recycled; same jokes, different faces. The jokes are a combination of wacky, witty and semi-satirical moments taken straight from Tex Avery or Hanna-Barbera production cartoons and the classy, emotional and romantic moments from the early Disney cartoons; actually, some ideas are copied even from other computer animated movies.
Of course, there are indeed some very few exceptions; this movie for instance; the computer generated images actually work here and paradoxically, the protagonists have real emotions. The fact that this movie doesn't rely on dialogues is another highlight here. There are some major mistakes here (ex. the effects of a ship leaning in space), but what the hell, I really don't care. I appreciate the sincerity of this movie.
A charming romance with a subtle satirical content and ""Do androids dream of electric ship"" concepts, for all the kids in the world.
This is the point where the whole computer animated movie business should have stopped...",NA
"mkdropper","30 August 2021","Even though I'm far from animated movies, this movie had an incredible impact on me.First of all, the animations and image quality in the movie (I watched it in the highest quality) are very high for the year it was released. It can be easily observed that a lot of effort is made especially for the particle effects.The movie knows very well how to make you happy or sad. What goes on among the ""soulless"" robots is more interesting than the human loves we are used to seeing all the time. In my opinion, the main reason why this love attracts attention is because our characters (robots) are so innocent. They are doing what they were programmed to do. However, in the meantime, they form a character of their own, and even love for each other when they meet. The sweetness of the robots on top of their innocence leaves the audience no choice but to love them. In addition, the film draws attention to what kind of situation humanity will perhaps take with advanced technology. While our sweet movie is going on, seeing people living without even moving by making use of advanced technology does create a small fear of the future in you.Also, the thing that makes it hard for me to like movies is the length of the movie, despite the lack of good cinematography. If the scenes are really well shot, hiding hidden details, or if the audience somehow attracts them, yes, it's okay to stretch the film. But today's movies don't do that. Wall-E, on the other hand, has done a great job on this. I don't think you will skip any scene because you are bored. Even the musical scenes somehow make them watch.Simple but sweet and well-executed subject. Great animations, and only 100 minutes. Simply an incredible movie. Everyone old and young should watch this masterpiece.",NA
