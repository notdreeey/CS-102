"SnoopyStyle","30 December 2013","Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) as a young quiet kid idolized explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer) and his discovery of Paradise Falls. Ellie is much more animated and also a great fan of Muntz. Together they would marry and live their lives together until the day she dies. Now Carl is hounded by a property developer and forced to go to a retirement home. Instead he ties a sea of helium balloons to his home and float away to Paradise Falls. Wilderness Explorer scout Russell who's trying to get an Assisting the Elderly badge gets dragged along on the adventure.The first part of this movie is a real tear jerker. When Carl and Ellie's lives flash through the years, all the heart breaks and all the love just jump off the screen. Then there is comedy as the journey to Paradise Falls starts. The movie gets very surreal with dog translators, and a very colorful bird. The villain is a bit too villainy. The story gets too serious at times. But it ends almost as emotionally as it starts. It is one of the best of Pixar.","

"MrGilgamesh","15 February 2020","This film is possibly one of the best animated films of all time as it tells an emotional moving story while being funny. As I said the emotion in this film is full of heart and even though I didn't cry it will make most people cry. The characters in this are perfect even if it is a small character like Ellie or big character like Carl everybody gets so much development even Charles Muntz the villain of the film is also given development, even more than some superhero films nowadays. Also this film has comedy some Pixar films now just want to make you cry but in the 2000s they had mix of sad and funny moments. So overall this film is as close to perfect as an animated film can get, it is has a mix of emotions it is funny and sad when it needs to be it has so much heart and the characters are perfect. This film in my opinion is the best Pixar film.","

"TheLittleSongbird","17 May 2010","I love Pixar and feel they have been pretty consistent. True I do prefer Toy Story over Cars and Finding Nemo over Ratatouille, but I find their films amazingly animated and thrilling. I thought that after the first two Toy Story films, that Pixar wouldn't be able to make a film to top them. WALL-E, yes I loved it, came pretty close, but in my opinion Up is Pixar's masterwork. And why do I say that? Because it is widely imaginative and astonishing in its emotional range.First of all, the animation is stupendous, beautiful backgrounds, beautifully drawn characters and stunning colours. The scenery and sights are just fantastic, down to the colour and visual detail that went into the film. Michael Giacchino's music is stunning as well, simple yet melodious and sublime. And I do have to concur with the majority about the opening montage; Finding Nemo had some beautiful moments and WALL-E's haunting isolation moved me close to tears but this opening montage was so poignant and utterly heart-breaking. It is quite simply one of the most beautiful and effective beginnings ever to an animated film.I have heard complaints that the story meanders when the talking dogs are introduced and that they were irritating. Can I respectfully disagree? What I loved about Up was how widely imaginative it was, in short why shouldn't a dog talk? It's an animated film, why does it have to COMPLETELY realistic? Elephants don't fly, look at what Disney did with Dumbo.The story, back on target was well written, thrilling and startling with a sense of adventure with enough action and high-flying escapism for kids and adults. The script had some truly hilarious and surreal moments, while Toy Story had wonderful sophisticated dialogue, the dialogue in Up made me laugh and it made me cry.And finally the characters, I loved them all, grumpy old widower Carl, stowaway Russell, eccentric adventurer Charles Muntz, the big bird and the hilarious Doug. Russell may be a tad annoying at first, but he grows on you. The voice acting is exceptional- Carl is voiced with real demeanour and depth by Ed Asner and Christopher Plummer, the wonderful underrated actor he is, is superb as Charles Muntz. But I do have to give mention to Bob Peterson, he is simply brilliant as Doug, he is really funny when he needs to be and never overdoes it.Overall, this is a wonderful film. There may be controversy over how Beauty and the Beast is no longer the only animated film to be nominated for best picture. Beauty and the Beast has been and always will be my favourite animated film and one of my favourite films of all time (The Lion King is a very close second), but Up is a great film and does deserve an award of some kind. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"Sleepin_Dragon","4 February 2023","A young Carl Fredricksen wanted to find and explore Paradise Falls. Years later, he and Boy Scout Russell embark, transporting his house with thousands of balloons.I don't think an animation ever had such a huge impact on me, as Up did. I watched it in the cinema with my young nephews, they sat there laughing their heads off and giggling, I sat there in floods of tears.The story is wonderful, and I know it's an animation, but how nice to see an elderly gentleman as the lead. Carl is a fascinating character, he's a little quirky, he's funny, but he's heartbroken.The animation is glorious, it holds up incredibly well, and looks better than many that followed, it also sounds marvellous. It's wonderfully bright and vivid, it will appeal to viewers young and old.Up never gets tired, it's an outstanding, funny, moving and heart-warming movie.10/10.","

"DonFishies","29 May 2009","Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) has lived a long life, but dreams of adventuring to South America. He wants to spend his remaining days in his home, but new high-rises are being constructed around it. After a chance accident, Carl loses his home, and is set to be taken into a retirement home. Unhappy with this idea, the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away, en route to his dream adventure. Except, he is not alone – young ""wilderness explorer"" Russell (Jordan Nagai) inadvertently shows up in mid-air, and Carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with him.The fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise Up. Ever since Toy Story, Pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films, and live action films. Sure, not all of them are as amazing as others (Cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of Ratatouille and WALL-E), but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio, and Up is no exception.Coming off the breakthrough of WALL-E, I was not expecting the same reaction to Up, but I was more than just pleasantly surprised. The film is hilarious, heartfelt, moving and depressing all at once. This may sound like it is an issue, and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure. But instead, it handles it quite well; splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for. And while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film, it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it. There is a lot going on in the film, but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do. It knows exactly where it wants to be and when. And where other recent Pixar films have failed (specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out), Up does not. It practically blasts its way through its beginning, all the way up to its ending, with time left to spare.What makes Up work so well, much like WALL-E before it, is the focus on very few characters. Where WALL-E spent the majority of its runtime primarily on Earth with its main character, a love interest and a cockroach, Up spends its majority with Carl, Russell, a ""bird"" named Kevin and a talking dog named Dug (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson). It does allow for more characters to enter in later on, but the focus never strays from these main characters. Some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories, but as the film progresses, it is clear it is telling one story – the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most. The film builds up Carl's backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film. We know from the very first trailer that Carl is a fairly mean old man, but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a man.But the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure. While WALL-E is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade, Up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness. But while WALL-E got caught up in its own environmentally sound message, Up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture. It is frequently thrilling and exciting, and lets up only for a few moments at a time. For such an older character, the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas. Sure, it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film, but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun – something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years. It came back for a short while with the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted, depressing narratives. And while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far, it never wallows in the sadness. It throws the moments at you, and then quickly moves on. And as said previously, the tonal shifts work excellently in Up's favour.But of course, an animated movie cannot work without its animation. While Up is not a breakthrough in the way other Pixar films have been, it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films. It does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances, but this only continues to work towards it being even better. The locales are realistic looking; the dog fur is near perfect. For me, watching Carl's facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing. The little details and minute perfections have always been key to the Pixar films, and Up is no different. Additionally, the 3D effects really add a layer to the film, and bring the movie to life (unlike other recent efforts like Monsters vs. Aliens and Bolt).I cannot praise Up enough. Words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is. Pixar continues to outdo itself year after year, even with their subpar films. While each film has their own flaws, Up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years. I adored every minute, and look forward to watching it again with an even bigger smile on my face.10/10.","

"ironhorse_iv","23 September 2015","What's up? Up is up! It was very successful movie! It even was nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards. It was the second animation film to do that. Directed by Pete Docter, Up is Pixar's tenth film in their series and their first full-length 3-D film. The film tells the story of an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen (Voiced by Edward Asner) whom trying to fulfill his late wife's dream by taking their house to South America. The only problem is, that an earnest Boy Scout named Russell (Voiced by Jordan Nagai) has tagged along, making the simple trip, so much, more complex. Can Carl make it to South America or will his late wife's dreams be shattered? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found this movie to be very entertaining. The movie is gorgeous and colorful. Sadly, the 3D isn't worth it, but it's still, beautiful to the eyes. I love the amazing music by Michael Giacchino. I just wish, the tune sound more South or Latin American, than European, because it would make more sense. The movie is unsurprisingly well action part. Great pacing. The film is also well-acted. Everybody did their parts, very well. Edward Asner was a great choice as Mr. Fredricksen. I love his grumpiness in his voice. The use of mostly grunts, make it seem, like his responses come from a protective stance, rather than his own grouchy nature. Jordan Nagai as Russell is just as likable. He has the most lines, in the film, and none of it, sounds too annoying. I guess, there was something, sweet about his voice. You really do hear it, whenever, Russell speaks. I love that the actor wasn't even trying to get cast for the role, but end up, getting it, over his brother who was. It show, how charming, his voice is. The supporting cast's voice acting is just as memorable. Christopher Plummer as the villain, Charles Muntz, the explorer was fun to listen to. Bob Peterson as Dug, the dog, was pretty amazing. His voice in this, remind me so much of veteran voice actor, Dom DeLuise. I also love the cameo from Pixar's own favorite actor, John Ratzenberger in his minor role. As much as I love the voice acting; I really love, how the cartoon characters appear in this film. I like how, they have more child-like appealing cartoony look. The whole over the top celebrity caricatured facial appearances kinda works, because the older computer model for humans, used in Toy Story 1&2 are just way too bland-looking and unappeased. It has that creepy uncanny valley look to it. Anyways, I think, the new model gives the movie, the amount of surrealism to make the plot to work. I really doubt, the film could work, with more realistic facial appearances, because how bizarre, the premise is. While, the appearance of Carl is meant to resemble Spencer Tracy as he appeared in his final film, 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. I like his short square status, and cartoony facial expressions. It makes Carl stand out. Unlike some critics, I also love, how Russell look. He doesn't look, like a kid with Down syndrome. He looks like a normal kid. I think, they were a little too harsh in their judgment. I also love the fact, that Russell is clearly Asian American, but his character lack the typical Asian over-stereotyping. Surprising, it makes the character, so much, more appealing, because it's not stepping over to over-used racial clichés. Charles F. Muntz really looks like, an old explorer, but his character's looks was a bit jarring. I really had a hard time, believing, that he's that well maintain, at his age, when he spent, most of the film, living for so long, outside of civilization. In my opinion, he should have, look, a little more broken-down. Last is Dug. He's a very realistic looking golden retriever. I own one, and they got it exactly right. I like how he closes his mouth and freezes when he notices a squirrel. Funny moment right there. For the story, it's both a hit and miss. I love that the film deals with more adult like drama, than childish antics. Having Carl still dealing with the loss of his wife, gave the movie, so much depth. It was really needed. However, besides the awesome and unexpected genuine tearjerker opening marriage montage, the film goes into another direction, with its absurdity. It's really off the wall, crazy and convenient, that Carl able to travel to South America in the way, he's traveling. The movie takes great artistic license, when it comes to engineering and physics. You have to really, be willing to suspension your disbelief from the rest of the entire film. Especially, when Russell was designed to be the child that Carl and his wife were unable to have, in both a figurative and literal spirit. Another thing, I didn't get about the plot, is how Charles Muntz can be, easily discredited. Clearly, the amount of what he found, in his short life, would give, his statements about the exotic bird, some credit. Clearly, much of the unexplainable questions in the plot, could be solve in the Carl is crazy theory that certain people has latch on. In theory, Carl didn't travel to South America, instead the Balloons are metaphors, reflecting Carl's happy and uplifting memories of his wife. Hints, why he was stubbornly clinging to them and refuses to let go, as if he's afraid he's going to fall. It wasn't until he did, was he able to live life, once more. Other people have notice, some themes similarity in the plot to John Milton's great poems Paradise Lost, Harvey Potter's Balloon Farm by Jerdine Nolen, and most of all, several really obvious references to Studio Ghibli. Overall: It deserve its good praise. A must-watch. Things can only go up from here.","

"ccthemovieman-1","22 November 2009","This is another film in which it really helps to know in advance what it is, or more specifically, what it isn't. Then, you go from there. I enjoyed the animated film very much but, some of that was due to the fact a friend clued me in first, saying ""this isn't really a comedy or a film for little kids. Don't expect a ton of laughs."" So, instead of seeking laughs (although I still got them here and there), I just enjoyed the adventure story and marveled at the amazing artwork. Seen on Blu-Ray, this is yet another example in which you shake your head and wonder, ""How does the artwork get any better than this?"" Then, about six months from now, another will come along and I'll say the same thing. Overall movies may not be better today than ""in the old days,"" but there is no dispute there are two areas in which films keep getting better and better: special-effects and animation. This is another example of that.The colors and the detail in here are almost beyond description. The artwork ranges from bold to subdued, but always stunning. I lost track how many times I wanted to just pause and admire the picture for a few minutes. From super-sharp closeups of the old man's face to lush jungle scenery, this high-definition disc is worth every penny/Back to the story, I found it a combination adventure-fantasy-comedy-suspense-sentimental story, about in that order, too. Generally-speaking, I would think adults would like this more than kids, but I may be wrong. Everyone - regardless of age - will have their jaw drop more than once viewing the incredible-looking scenes. It's really a feast for the eyes. Finally, if you like extras, there are tons of them in the four-disc DVD set.","

"ferguson-6","31 May 2009","Greetings again from the darkness. Another crackling collaboration of Pixar and Disney, and as expected, it is touching, funny, thrilling and amazing to look at and watch. Only a step below Toy Story just because it is not quite as ground-breaking, though the story is even better.While I love technology and effects, I am first and foremost a story guy when it comes to movies. This has as good of story as any film you will see. My only caution is that it seems geared towards grown-ups, not kids. The montage of Carl and Ellie growing old together is without dialogue and will probably bore some kids. Their parents certainly won't be bored; however, as it will resonate with most anyone over age 40 who hasn't taken the time to chase their childhood dreams.No question, this film is a barrage of color and eccentric characters, and can even be a bit frightening at times. Still, the key to this one are the stories and quests of the elderly Mr. Fredrickson and the young Russell, trying to earn his badge of honor. From the beginning, Disney has always had a finger on the pulse of youngsters. Here, we aren't given the usual Hollywood garbage of brainiac kids who make the adults look stupid. Instead we are given a pudgy, slightly goofy kid just trying to get his parents to take note.Special kudos to Ed Asner for bringing Mr. Fredrickson to life ... in good times and bad. He never goes overboard and is quite often absolutely perfect. Christopher Plummer has a limited role as bad guy Charles Muntz. Or is he really so bad? Cast aside by society, he has spent his life searching for redemption.I am not saying the kids won't enjoy, but I am saying make sure parents and grandparents tag along. You will be entertained, delighted and moved.","

"Smells_Like_Cheese","4 June 2009","Seriously, I'm convinced, Pixar is maybe the only movie studio that is providing the best movies around. Who said that animated films can't be considered real movies? Can't be considered an art form? Up is the latest creation from Disney and Pixar, after last year's smash hit WALL-E, I felt like they couldn't at all top themselves and they did it again with this incredibly charming story. Admittingly from the trailer, I wasn't sure this story was going to work as well, but I got the opportunity to see Up this week and was just totally blown away by it's story, animation and characters. The thing I adore about these movies that Disney and Pixar are creating is that they're not just for the kids, but the adults as well, this is something that I could even see an adult seeing by themselves. This story doesn't insult kid's intelligence and is extremely entertaining for anyone to enjoy, to go through this adventure with an old man who just wanted to make his wife happy.Carl Fredricksen, a quiet young boy, meets Ellie in her clubhouse, discovering together they share the same interest in exploration as their hero, famed explorer Charles F. Muntz. Ellie expresses her desire to move her clubhouse to Paradise Falls in South America, a promise she makes Carl keep. Carl and Ellie fall in love, wed and grow old together in the old house where they first met. Ellie dies of old age before they can take their trip, leaving Carl living alone in their home. After a tussle with a construction worker over Carl's broken mailbox, the court orders Carl to move into a retirement home. Carl comes up with a scheme to keep his promise to Ellie, and creates a makeshift airship using thousands of helium balloons which lift his house off its foundation. Russell, a Wilderness Explorer trying to earn his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge, has stowed away on the porch after being sent on a snipe hunt by Carl the day before. After a storm throws them around for a while, they find themselves across a large ravine facing Paradise Falls. With their body weight providing ballast allowing Carl and Russell to pull the floating house, the two begin to walk around the ravine. As they walk towards Paradise Falls, Russell finds a colorful tropical bird which he names Kevin, not realizing that the bird is actually female. They later run into a dog with a translating collar named Dug. They discover Dug's owner is Charles Muntz, who has remained in South America for several decades to find a bird like Kevin in order to restore his reputation after bringing back a skeleton and being called a fraud. Though Carl is initially thrilled to meet his hero, when he realizes that Muntz is after Kevin and will kill to obtain her, Carl takes steps to save the bird and escape from Muntz.Up is seriously the best movie I have seen so far this year, it's actually one of my favorite movies of all time, I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this film. Wither it was the fun and charming story between Carl and Russell, the crazy bird Kevin, or the story that nearly killed me in laughter, the dogs that have collars that make them talk. I don't remember the last time a movie that made me laugh so hard that my stomach hurt, it also made me tear up and smile. If someone ever tells you that an animated film can't be considered a real movie, just show them Up. I absolutely adore this movie, can't wait for it to come out on DVD and watch it again. This is a perfect family film, actually scratch that, it's a perfect film, the animation is incredible, the characters are lovable and the story is magical. Up is going to be a film to be remembered for all time, great movie, go see it.10/10","

Truth is I really should have made the time before.Although I enjoy all the other Disney/pixar movies, I am at that teenage age where I mainly seek Violence, sex and gore. Thankfully my teenage boredom did me a big favour in helping what this fantastic masterpiece. This film was so fantastically deep, meaningful and moving beyond relief, as soon as I switched it off I rang my grandparents to tell them I love them.It should be made necessary that everyone everywhere should see this film and I think the world would be a much better place - it really is that good.100/10","

"colan","30 May 2009","If there's a list of great computer animation movies of all time, Pixar would dominate most of the top positions. Great story, great voice talent, great timing, great for all ages. It'd be hard to pick just one above another and perhaps another viewing of Up may be in order to figure out where I'd place it among so much stellar work.Up is by far the most emotional human drama of any Pixar movies thus far, very heavy, so much so if you're looking for pure fun with some jaw-dropping chase and/or thematic scenes and no downer moments, Up may not be for you. I saw it in a packed theatre of about a 65% adult, 35% adult split audience and it's the only time I can remember being in ANY animated movie where there was sniffles and watery eyes, and that was within the first 10 minutes of the movie. There's an undercurrent of life after losing a loved one in this movie, which I don't feel gives anything away. It's pretty heavy subject matter, Pixar handles it, like they do everything they touch, incredibly well, but it doesn't make it any less sad to have the material threaded throughout much of the movie you're reminded of it, but I suppose it's up to one's own interpretation of loss and how to place it in your life that perhaps will have an emotional effect on you.Story is what makes a great movie great. Without story, you don't really have anything, maybe some effects, some action, maybe some cute or clever sight gags, maybe some laughs, hopefully some emotion, where Pixar shines above all others in animation and over a good 99% of the movies out there is they can intertwine it all and do it seemingly effortless, which is an incredible feat. To do this in a few movies is one thing, but Pixar has pretty much nailed this now for their entire career of making movies, that's just simply unprecedented. I should note I saw the 3D version which, to be honest, didn't really take the movie to the next level. One of the more well known syndicated reviewers had said you're better off seeing the non-3D version on screen, and I actually agree. The 3D glasses added little to nothing to the movie except for an eye-strain headache later in the night. It didn't take away from Up mind you, it just didn't add to it either. Up is a great movie either way you slice it and it should be noted, the theatre I saw it in gave it a fairly loud round of applause at the end. It's pretty rare these days that an audience applauds after a movie, perhaps we as a society has become too jaded, or too just expecting of the goods or feeling we're entitled to the entertainment. It's nice when a movie hits on all cylinders and elicits such a range and emotional reaction people who don't know each other in a packed room all gasp, laugh, cry, and applaud together. Great movies however can do that and Up is truly a great movie.","

"steve-bailey-1","27 May 2009","UP, Pixar's latest animated feature, is just delightful. But how do you go about extolling the movie's virtues without giving away its surprises? Like the kid at the beginning of the movie, you don't try to conquer the immovable force; you work around it.The one clue I can give away – because it's the movie's heavily hyped premise – is that Carl Fredrickson, a gruffy old widower (voiced with gruffy old charm by Ed Asner), miraculously inflates enough balloons to use his house as an aircraft. Soon, he finds himself reluctantly sharing his ride with a short-attention-spanned kid named Russell.I'll also mention a couple of other items that can gauge your potential interest in the movie. One is a gag that is a take-off on a famous painting – perhaps too inside of an inside joke, but typical of Pixar's cheery attempts to appeal to viewers of all ages.Also, part of the plot involves Carl's long-held wish to meet a Lindbergh-type adventurer named Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer!). This is another in-joke that's even vaguer than the first one. Cartoon historians know that Walt Disney started in the cartoon biz by creating Oswald the Rabbit for producer Charles Mintz, who then greedily stole the rights to Disney's creation. This gives you a pretty good idea where the ostensible hero Muntz stands in the scheme of things.Beyond that, I can only offer you some enticing clues about the characters. There's a dog who's the leader of his pack and in menacing beyond measure, until he opens his mouth and gets one of the movie's biggest laughs. There's a huge, awkward bird that is a big laugh-getter at first. Then she becomes a real enough character that – at least in the audience I was in – when she's injured, she elicits screams of fright worthy of Bambi's late mother.There's surprising, heartfelt emotion, vivid imagery (you can almost touch the landscapes and skies), and a music score by Michael Giacchino that's practically a character in the movie – particularly in a thoughtful montage that takes Carl from childhood to widowhood.There aren't many (or at least not enough) live-action movies that are engrossing as this cartoon. Pixar Studios has gotten to be one of those movie icons that shouldn't even have to deliver a premise to get funded anymore. The moneymen should just shut up, hand over the money, and trust they'll get a product that will appeal to everyone.UP is only the second Pixar feature to get a PG rating, only for mildly intense imagery and action – nothing off-color in the least. Again, if you can handle ""Bambi,"" this film should be a breeze.","

"filipemanuelneto","22 August 2015","This lovely film tells the story of Carl Fredrickson, a little friendly widower who lives alone in a house restored along with his late wife, Ellie, whose memory he cherishes constantly. Forced to leave his home, threatened by real-estate interests, to live in a nursing home where he didn't want to go, Carl decides to go on a long journey that always wanted to do with his wife but that life never allowed... and departs with your home through a system that he created and that makes it fly. But the journey is bound to change radically when he meets the scout Russell, eight-year-old, grabbed on his porch, an unwitting passenger on that trip.Directed by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, two brilliant directors of Pixar Animation Studio behind hits like ""Wall-e"", ""Monsters Inc."" or ""Finding Nemo"", this film has a number of experienced voices and a touching soundtrack, which earned the Academy Award that year for Best Original Score. A curious fact: the place represented as a destination point for Carl's trip - the fictional Paradise Falls - exists on the real life, in the border between Venezuela and Brazil: its Mount Roraima.The most touching on this film is to see the love of Carl and Ellie, alive even after her death and visible in the way he keeps her memory alive and ever present. Russell's goodness also move us, especially when he is confronted with the harsh ways of stubborn Carl, who sees in Russell a problem. Another deeply moving character is Dough, a friendly and affectionate dog who speaks through a device placed on his leash.For all these things, ""Up"" is a film for the whole family, is a film that touches us, moves us and thrills. It proves that, if love cannot move mountains can still move homes, and that no one is too old to live an adventure or fulfill a dream.","

"auuwws","18 January 2021","One of the best Pixar movies, the beginning of the movie makes anyone cry even if they turn them from your stone, and do not cry from any movie. The beginning of the movie and the movie stars were excellent. I'm really sympathetic to Carl. Rarely is a cartoon character well written in a target for children. The story of the movie was excellent, the message of the movie was, and I feel that the movie made me feel the magic of the Disney films that I missed a lot, the evil of the film was disappointing and was not convincing unlike the rest of the bad guys at Pixar and Disney, my rating for the movie is 9.2","

"planktonrules","29 May 2009","As I am much more hesitant to give a movie a score of 10 than most reviewers, take my score of 9 as a ringing endorsement for this sweet CGI film from Pixar. In addition, the film is the first 3-D film by the studio and it looked lovely.The film begins with a sweet but VERY emotionally draining prologue. You see Carl Fredricksen as a very young boy along with his first two loves--the adventures of the explorer, Charles Muntz, and his meeting and falling in love with Ellie. All this is done with a minimum of dialog and it is one of the sweetest segments I've seen in years--and is a first for something this deep and emotional from a computer generated film. Keep a few Kleenex nearby--you'll likely need it.Then, the film jumps ahead to the present day. Carl is now elderly and alone. His life is quite sad and he dwells on the recent loss of Ellie. Fortunately, the film doesn't dwell on this too long or become maudlin--though it did come a bit close at times. Now, with nothing in his life other than memories AND the court pushing him into a retirement home against his will, Carl comes up with a crazy plan--to float his home away with a bazillion balloons and take it to South America!! Unfortunately, while the plan works, Carl also gets an unwelcome passenger (Russell). Now Russell is an absolutely adorable character--wonderfully rendered and with a fittingly cute voice. You cannot help but love him. But, since Carl is alone and childless and grumpy, he is less than enthralled with this hitchhiker.Eventually, they arrive in South America and meet some new friends--a bizarre giant bird and Dug, the dog. But, being a family film, you KNOW that there must be some villain and sure enough, along comes a very, very, very elderly Muntz who seems a tad...""touched"". This sets off some very hair-raising adventures and you'll just need to tune it to see what happens next.Technically speaking, this film was incredible and shows that the same old software is NOT being used but a newer generation with greater clarity and richness. I loved how through the course of the film, for instance, Carl's beard stubble starts to slowly grow in as well as the lovely shading and colors. While I loved RATATOUILLE and WALL-E for their animation, this looked a lot better--plus came in 3-D. I just saw Dreamworks' latest film the week before (MONSTERS VS. ALIENS) and frankly UP looked immensely better--there was just no comparison.As for the story, it was highly imaginative and strange--in a good way. I can only think of one other film that is like UP at all, and that is the wonderful French live action film, LE PAPILLON. It, too, is about an elderly single man who has an adorable child dumped in his lap and like UP, by the end of the film the old man has essentially been adopted by the kid. Both are rather predictable in that sense, but both also make it work due to brilliant writing, adorable kids and plot elements that are very unique and magical. Heck, in UP, the many dogs in the film can talk AND are excellent chefs--where have you ever seen that before?! Overall, it's a great film for almost all ages. I did notice in the theater that one kid (about 4) got very, very, very upset when the cute bird was captured--and he screamed and cried for some time. Keep this in mind if you do take young kids to see it--it may elicit come tears though there is no dirty language and the violence is mostly mild. For Pixar, this is among their best.","

"guiarRK","15 May 2009","I was luckily able to catch a screening a few weeks ago here in Houston.As an avid lover of Wall-E, I felt Pixar could never reach those heights again.I was wrong.UP's story will probably seem peculiar at first glance. An old man as a protagonist? It definitely blew my expectations. The first 5 minutes demolished every other Pixar feature just because it was the first time I cried in a theater.This just shows how much heart there is to the movie. I really don't want to get into specifics because of spoilers but the movie literally has everything.Amazing visual effects.Amazing sound.Hilarious comedy.Breath taking action.Heart.All those combined equal something special. Today's movies like to blow you away with gimmicks, Pixar is different. Each movie shows soul and UP definitely has it.I can't wait until it comes out so I can see it in 3d, im bringing everybody.10/10","

"Simonster","13 May 2009","Viewed at the Festival de Cannes 2009 The opening film of this year's festival, and the first animated film ever to have this honour, Up is truly a film for all ages. The story of the adventures of an old man and a young boy, a flying house tethered to countless balloons, a long-lost (and mad) explorer, a giant bird called Kevin and assorted 'talking' dogs gets funnier and more exciting as it goes along.This isn't slapstick humour, although there are some lovely visual gags, but deeper, more thoughtful. At times Up is even touching and poignant.Visually, this is a treat and while I was sceptical about the use of 3D to begin with, it is built into the story so seamlessly that it really is worth the effort to seek it out. At the same time, I can't help feeling the 2D version could be even better because the 3D glasses had the effect of dimming the picture. The use of colour in the film is especially noteworthy, with various palettes used according to mood, character and phase of the story. Character voicing and music are also spot on.I have no connection with Pixar, Disney or the film whatsoever, even if this review reads like a puff piece. The fact is, Up is an incredible piece of cinema, was a big hit with a very demanding press audience, and is worthy of your time and money.Anyone who says animated films cannot amuse and entertain, while at the same time delivering any kind of emotion, does not know what they are talking about.Up is so good I can now forgive Pixar for Cars!","

"Apemangalore","29 May 2009","If Pixar - as a studio - has any weakness, it's that they have no idea how to make a bad film. Again and again they release entertaining movies with not only a terrific sense of humor, but a level of storytelling that has set a standard for today's films, animated or otherwise. While I was obviously extremely excited to see Up, never did I expect it - or, to be honest, anything else from this year - to reach the level of quality of this year's first animated film, Coraline (which, along with last year's Bolt and Wall-E, became one of my favorite films of all time). Well, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Simply put, Up is a perfect movie.Easily the most emotionally impactful portion of the entire film, the first ten to fifteen minutes of Up are nothing short of beautiful. Using little to no dialogue, the opening ""montage"" of this film tells the story of Carl and his wife Ellie, and the wonderful life that they share together. Carl is such a lovable character, that you feel for him from the very beginning. Without trying to come off as cliché or anything, you feel the joy that he feels, and when his wife passes away, you feel his loss. By the end of the whole sequence, I was in tears.This movie is freakin' hilarious. Without a doubt the funniest film that Pixar has ever made, each and every character in Up provides their own bit of humor. Dug the dog (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson) is especially hilarious every single time that he ""opens his mouth"", and yet still proves to be a key part of this emotional roller coaster ride. The movie also does a terrific job at making you feel a sense of wonder, and you just buy into the adventure of these two characters. Finally, I want to give a special nod to Christopher Plummer as the famous wilderness explorer, Charles Muntz, who is easily my favorite Pixar villain.I love Up. Go see it now, as my review just can't do it justice. Not only is it extremely entertaining, but also gut-bustingly hilarious, and beautifully told throughout. To quote John Campea of TheMovieBlog.com, ""The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that it ended."" The result is a film that's on par with Wall-E and The Incredibles as my favorite Pixar movie to date (which, again, is saying a hell of a lot, considering that they're two of my top 10 favorite films of all time) and while it may take a couple more viewings to say for certain, I have no qualms with saying that Up is one of the finest films I've ever seen.","

"michael11391","21 May 2009","What can I say about Pixar? Amazing?? Perfect?? Got to see this at the Cannes Film Festival in France (went on a trip with my family) and Pixar gives us another instant classic: Up.The movie focuses on 78-year old man Carl Fredrickson's (voiced by Edward Asner) life who always had a dream of going on a journey to South American to see the wilds of it. He buys thousands of balloons just to attach it to his house to float up in the sky. So, he starts with his journey up in the sky in his house with balloons attached to it. Suddenly, he's not alone and somebody's at the door while flying, it's a boy scout kid named Russell. He invites the boy with him on his journey to South America.Just brilliant and simple story-telling, beautiful visuals as usual with Pixar, awesome voice work, funny and smart dialogue, beautiful score once again by Michael Giacchino & very, very enjoyable characters. Speaking of characters, the highlight of the film: Dug the Dog. A sort of ""robot"" dog that will have you have you in a lot of stitches each scene that dog is in and that was the case with me. Simply, one of the funniest characters Pixar ever made. Pete Doctor, one of the four Pixar directors (John Lassester, Andrew Stanton, Brad Bird) who directed Monster's Inc (2001) needs and should get nominated for his clever, genius and smart directing of this but if Stanton didn't get the nods for (Finding Nemo and WALL-E) and Bird for (The Incredibles & Ratatouille) which they should of been, then the Oscars are making another HUGE mistake for not nominating this guy for this movie.Up is the funniest Pixar movie, funnier than the Toy Story movies, A Bug's Life & Finding Nemo which were the funniest, in my opinion. The movie is not just hilarious, it's emotional and sad at times. Like WALL-E, it focuses on the character feelings but not as magical as WALL-E. Still, Up is full of emotional, fun and hilarious proportions. Your in for a BIG ride in this!! 10/10.","

"claudio_carvalho","28 November 2009","The boy Carl Fredrickson is a dreamer that idolizes the adventurer Charles Munts. When he meets the girl Ellie, who also worships Munts, they become close friends. However Charles Munts falls in disgrace, accused of forging the skeleton of the monster of Paradise Falls, and he travels in his blimp to South America to bring the monster alive and he is never seen again. Carl and Ellie get married and they promise to each other to travel together to Paradise Falls and build a house there. Many years later, Ellie dies and the lonely Carl refuses to move from their house despite the offers of the owner of a construction company. When Carls hits one worker that damaged his box-mail, he is sentenced to move to a retirement home. However, he uses many balloons to float his house and travel to Paradise Falls. While floating, he finds that the boy Russell, who is in the Wilderness Explorer Training trying to get his assisting the elderly badge to be promoted to senior, is a stowaway on board. They travel together to South America where Russell finds a weird bird that he names Kevin and the talking dog Doug. Then they meet the insane villain Charles Munts that spent his life in the forest trying to catch Kevin with his talking dogs. But Carl and Russell decide to protect Kevin and they have the adventure of their lives. ""Up"" is a surrealistic adventure full of sentiments, where the heroes are an old widower and an annoying fat boy. The first point that impresses is how touching this story is with the dramatic situation of the elder Carl after losing his beloved Ellie, lonely and forgotten by the world that is changing. I slightly recalled the situation of Walt Kowalski, performed by Clint Eastwood in ""Gran Torino"". The annoying Russell is responsible for most of the funniest sequences, especially those with Kevin and the talking dog Doug. There are many details and layers in this beautifully sad tale. Further, it is also impressive how Disney and Pixar succeed in releasing one excellent movie after another like ""Wall-e"" or ""The Incredibles"". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Up – Altas Aventuras"" (""Up – High Adventures"")","

"C-Younkin","26 May 2009","""Up"" is a winner, and I couldn't be less surprised. Anyone still putting a limit on how new and inventive they think a Pixar film can be deserves to have their socks blown off. For the rest of us, just buy a ticket and expect to be taken away. This new flick is the work of writers/directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, two guys who have each been around the making of Pixar flicks before. Docter was a director on ""Monsters Inc"", a writer on ""Toy Story"" and a co-writer and director on ""Wall*E."" Peterson was a writer on ""Finding Nemo"". Both know the guidelines for success and while ""Up"" doesn't reach the heights of say a ""Wall*E"" or a ""Toy Story"", it's still a fantastic movie because, well, I don't think the people Pixar hires know how to make anything other than fantastic movies.This one is about Carl Fredericksen (Edward Asner), a 78-year old retired balloon salesman living alone in a house full of old memories. Carl and his wife Ellie met each other as young children, both enamored by the newsreels about adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). They eventually married and planned on seeing the world together, especially Paradise Falls in South America, but life kept getting in the way and before he knew it, Ellie died.As the world changes, Carl refuses to change with it. When developers threaten to move him out of his house and into a retirement home, the old codger rigs his house up with thousands of balloons and before you can say ""way to go Carl"", he floats away, determined to have the adventure he and his wife never had. He doesn't plan on taking 8-year old chubby wilderness explorer Russell (Jordan Nagai) with him or crash landing on the other side of Paradise Falls, or finding an exotic female snipe (that Russell names Kevin) or a group of talking dogs (one named Dug befriends them) tracking down the bird for Muntz, who it turns out is a sinister villain, but things kinda turn out that way.You're grabbed instantly. The adorable opening montage of the Carl and Ellie love story is more endearing and moving in its dialogue-less 10-minute entirety than any other romance this year by a long shot. This is another Pixar flick that goes in a daring direction. We next see Carl as a heartbreaking old man, his wife dead and the world no longer needing him. You forgive him his bitterness and you love him for the sentimental streak he has towards the things he and his wife shared together. His crabbiness is a little funny but there are also some heavy scenes early on as well. It sets up a beautiful, multi-layered story about enduring love and learning to live life without limits.When a thrilling rainstorm crashes Carl and Russell on the other side of Paradise Falls, the two must each harness themselves to the house floating above them. The characters each look terrific and share a good chemistry. Russell is the usual 8-year old kid, talkative, inquisitive, and annoyingly overeager. He is a good comic foil to crabby Carl, his big, rosey smile and plump round stature a counter to the stout, frowningly square-faced Carl. As the two spend more time together, a wonderfully written friendship develops.The movie is full of visual gags and the talking dog-henchmen are great fun. Muntz, an adventurer who travels around the world in a big blimp, offers a menacingly evil villain to chase Carl and Russell through rough mountainous terrain before the exciting final house vs. blimp in-air showdown. Plus the movie looks fantastic, a lush array of candy color and grand scenery. And the vocal cast, from Edward Asner to Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai each deftly voice their roles. ""Up"" is one of the year's rare treasures, a movie that flies in every way possible and from Pixar, you shouldn't expect anything less.","

"jackson_ro","23 July 2022","Pixar at its finest. A rare and unlikely duo forming what is arguably the most emotionally powerful protagonist to this day. Heartfelt throughout, aesthetically romantic and emotionally lasting, the only negative is perhaps there is about 20-30 minutes where the movie becomes a bit of a drag featuring the antagonist. To this day, the beginning of the film is one of my most memorable cinema experience.","

"kellielulu","11 July 2022","Animated or not Up is one of the best movies ever! I love the relationship between Carl and Russell that develops . Showing a friendship between the different generations and that are not related is simple but profound. A connection between different generations is one of the most enriching experience for the young and old.Carl has trouble coming to terms with the loss of his beloved wife Ellie . He has guilt over the adventure they planned but never got to take. When his house is condemned he plots to sail away with the house and take the home he and Ellie shared . Enter Boy Scout Russell trying to earn his help the elderly badge.You can pretty much guess Russell ends up going along even if neither of them planned it. In spite of his determination not to Carl ends up caring about Russell . There is a funny, sweet bird , a lovable robot dog and a treacherous villain who all come into play .When Carl reads Ellie's scrapbook he sees she considered their whole life together an adventure and she wants him to have another one . He's finally able to move on .For some reason many mainly like the first part of the movie but to me the whole thing is special and it wouldn't be the same without sweet little Russell.","

"choco_taco","12 May 2009","I was lucky enough to get a ticket to a special pre-release screening of Up at Pixar studios in Emeryville, organized by the San Francisco Film Society. After a hour-long reception in the atrium of their beautiful main building we went through some rigorous security (metal detectors!) and were treated to an hilarious short (Partly Cloudy) and Pixar's new high water mark, Up.My favorites to date have definitely been Wall-E and the Incredibles, and Up is another slightly-left-of-center masterpiece. The emotional impact of the beautiful, wordless summation of Carl's life that opens the movie is the bass note that resonates through the whole film and is at least as affecting as the scene in Wall-E when he holds his own hands while watching Hello Dolly. The rest of the movie, of course, is breathtaking on just about every level, especially the tactile quality of all the characters and textures and the completely realized weather effects and action scenes. With no ""new"" technical milestones (fur in Monsters, Inc., water in Finding Nemo, realistic camera effects in Wall- E), the design is the main focus, from the hilariously stylized characters to the amazing setting of the tepui.As the associate producer who participated in the Q&A following the movie pointed out, the past three Pixar movies have not been easy sells to their parent company Disney (they'll be back in familiar territory with Toy Story 3 and Cars 2), but Pixar's commitment to inventive, story-driven films continues to pay off here. All of the good press is true, and I can't wait to see it again. Thanks for staying true to yourselves Pixar!","

"pickle-92642","3 August 2021","Yet ANOTHER incredible entry to the Pixar saga. It's just so good (as it always was for Pixar from 1995-2010). The first 15 minutes of this movie is a masterpiece in storytelling. Nobody can tell me otherwise. I think literally every single time my mom has watched it she has cried. I don't cry during movies, but there are a couple things that definitely get me close... and the first 15 mins is one of them. The rest of the movie is a super fun adventure and is one of the funniest Pixar films to date. The kid, the bird, the dogs, all great. The message the film implies is also very important and sadly true for all. Watched this so much as a kid, and can't wait to show it to my kids. I feel like this is probably the older generations favorite Pixar film, and with good reason.","

"Craig_McPherson","30 May 2009","Sadly, there aren't enough superlatives in the English language with which to laud Up, the latest offering from the folks at Disney/Pixar. This is quite simply the best movie of any genre to emerge thus far this year. No small praise considering how I've long been adverse to ""kids movies"", pegging them as being shallow, vapid, and simplistic - a personal preconception which Pixar mercifully shattered with 2004's The Incredibles and 2008's WALL-E, which proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that for all their acclaim as an animation studio, they are equally brilliant story tellers Up tells the story of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner), who as a child meets Ellie, later to become the love of his life. Carl and Ellie find they share a common dream – to one day visit Paradise Falls, a mysterious tropical oasis in South America made famous in vintage newsreels chronicling the exploits of explorer/adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Life, however, manages to get in the way as the two grow up, get married, experience the pain of miscarriage, and eventually grow old, so much so that father time catches up on Ellie, leaving Carl a widower. All of this is conveyed with little dialog in a masterful sequence that had the audience, old and young alike, sniffling throughout.If you're thinking this isn't the usual stuff you see in ""kids movies"" you're right. But all credit is due to Pixar and the directorial and writing team of Pete Docter and Bob Peterson for realizing that children aren't idiots, and can handle complex, often tragic stories, if conveyed in the proper manner. It's a refreshing change from the over-protective mentality that once saw all hints of violence edited out of Warner Bros/Looney Tunes cartoons.In Up, characters bleed, there's implied murder, and it's all counter-balanced with some of the most delightfully twisted humor that's as inspired as anything the Zucker brothers ever came up with. The story literally had me careening from being misty-eyed to laughing heartily, frequently in the span of minutes.Faced with forced relocation to a retirement home, Carl opts for one final gambit, to fly his house down to Paradise Falls with the aid of a multitude of helium-filled balloons affixed to the roof of his house. Along for the ride is Russell (Jordan Nagai), a Wilderness Scout seeking to add a merit badge to his collection. Eventually the duo are complimented by Dug (voiced by co-director and writer Bob Peterson) a dopey derelict dog equipped by the now aged Muntz with a translator collar that converts dog thoughts to English.Like WALL-E, Up manages to imbue its characters with depth and humanity, while at the same time tell a story that is mature, delightful, and most of all, terrifically funny. In an era when Hollywood seems only capable of re-boots and do-overs, Up is not merely a refreshing stroke of original brilliance, it is likely the best movie you will see all year.... or until Pixar emerges with their next effort.","

"Rectangular_businessman","11 June 2010","I loved this film. I always like the movies made form Pixar, but this have to be the best movie released by that studio so far. Not only the animation and the story are incredibly good, but also the characters are very likable and all have unique, fantastic personalities. Carl Fredericksen must be not only the best character created by Pixar, but also one of the best movie characters ever made in the story of cinema.Up is funny, exciting, both heartwarming and heartbreaking, but filled with a message of optimism, that makes the film highly enjoyable, even the saddest parts of the story. I never liked so much a film as this one. I can clearly see why most of the reviews were so good: ""Up"" it's a masterpiece that deserves everyone's appreciation. Everything about this is perfect: The music, the animation, the story, the charactersAll is great.""Up"" is easily the best movie of the 2009, and it is the best film of the last decade. I highly recommend it to anyone.Heck, the first 10 minutes alone are far more emotional than the large majority of Hollywood films from the last 20 years.Too bad modern Pixar is not able to reach this same level anymore, but at least this movie will remain as the pinnacle of its golden age.","

"Quinoa1984","31 May 2009","Some, and you know who you are if you're reading this, may come across the IMDb page for Pixar's Up (and no, it's not Up! with an exclamation point, as that belongs to the 1976 Russ Meyer X-rated flick), and turn your nose up at it as just another Disney and/or Pixar kids flick. ""An old man with balloons tied to his house flying around with an annoying kid, not enough ""art"" for my taste"" (or something similar to that if not as snobbish). I want to relay an example for you that may get you excited: this is for Pixar a riff on Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo. You might remember that crazy little movie where Klaus Kinski, a dreamer obsessed with opera, decides he has to build an opera house in the middle of the South American jungle, so in order to accomplish this he has to drag his big freighter-ship across a mountain to the other side. It is a leap of faith, but we take it because it's led by a filmmaker with a compelling sense of telling a story with an equally compelling protagonist. Balloons tied to a house, ship across a mountain, not much difference if you ask me, just the degree of the ambition.But it's not enough to compare it to Herzog, or even really try to. Pixar's Up, directed by Pete Doctor, is original in its intent to make a serious adventure movie that starts off as something quite mature, makes it big leap to kids, and then straddles that line like that guy who crossed the twin towers on the tightrope in the 70s. Take your adjective, this is beautiful, audacious, heartbreaking, heartrending, sublime, hilarious, surreal, inventive film-making, and it doesn't talk down to any age group in its story of an old man, Carl Frederickson, who fulfills his and his late-wife's dream of having a house on a hilltop called Paradise Falls that their favorite explorer as kids flew to in South America. If you're a kid you'll not get any tasteless jokes (there's one poo joke that actually works since it's brief and, dare I say it, funny as hell), and it helps to get you prepared for some of the hardships that may come in life, like, well, the possibility of not having kids and losing your loved one in old age. Rare does it happen that you'll cry in the first ten minutes of a Disney family film anymore. Here's the rarity.Up is also in the tradition of wild fantasy, like a tale out of the Lost World mixed in with a tale out of Pixar's idols, Studio Ghibli. One could definitely see the kinds of characters like Carl, Russel and the hero-turned-villain explorer Charles Muntz in a Miyazaki film (as Ebert so thankfully noted in his review), but they also remain true to the Pixar tradition that's given them their distinction. They're never card-board cut-outs, and even when faced with certain plot elements reminiscent of Disney fare, such as with the big bird, ""Kevin"", in the jungle they have to help get back to her kids, or the (insane/perfect) comic relief of the dogs that talk with the collars around their necks, its dealt with the kind of love and care that should be given in solid storytelling. Nothing is too frivolous in Up, and there's an undercurrent of sadness to both Carl, for what he's lost and has to achieve without his late wife he's known since childhood, and for Russell lacking a father figure or real mother (this last part is handled really well, watch for ""Phyllis"" mentioned).Oh, and I forgot, it's animated in the usual tradition of Pixar fare: awesomely. Following on the heels of their arguable top-top masterpiece WALL-E, Up features the ordinary (inside a house, an old man) and the extraordinary (the birds, the dogs, the juxtaposition of a floating house with an airship, something else out of say Howl's Moving Castle) with delicacy and subtly while at the same time grandiosity and the vibrancy possible in the medium. I could go on and on, about how howlingly funny it is or how touching it is in the little moments. But make no mistake, Up is modern film art, even if it doesn't fit into your local art-house cinema. Take the (well-behaved/respectful) kids, take the old folks, take your rotten punk kid. It is what it is- squirrel! Good stuff.","

"jotix100","17 August 2010","Every once in a while a film comes our way that makes us sit and reflect to what extent the talent of creative minds contribute to our enjoyment, be it while watching a film, or a play, or a concert, or any other expression of the arts. This is exactly what we experienced with ""Up"", a positive film that reflects the times we live, and the sense of fantasy in all of us, told in simple terms, but packing a message of hope about humanity.""Up"", the Pixar creation of 2009 offers a magnificent entertainment for audiences of all ages. The minds behind this animated film were in the right places as they offered us their view of a fantastic voyage to an unknown world that only lived in the imagination of an older man, who in spite of his advanced age, decided to take the road to the unknown because he is at the end of his life and the world in which he lives is not what he once knew. With the help of a boy, he does what he could not have been able to pursue when his beloved wife was still around. The prospect of living his last days in one of those institutions that cater to the old, the sick and the infirm, Carl Fredricksen opts for an escape. His beloved house serves as the vehicle where he will reach the Paradise Falls in South America. Unknown to him, Russell, the boy scout wanting to get another badge for assisting the elderly, comes along for a trip to the unknown. Little did he know the dangers he and Russell will have to face while at their destination, battling the egotistical explorer that once was his idol. Because of his determination, and with the help of Russell, he ends up being the real hero of the story, having escaped the indignities of the stay in the nursing home.Pete Docter and Bob Peterson directed ""Up"" using the Pixar amazing technology of animation. Mr. Docter the director of ""Monsters Inc."", also contributed to the screenplay. It the first time Mr. Petersen, a writer, had been involved in directing. Both men show a great talent for working in a medium that presents challenges for even the most experienced men trying to work in it.Ed Asner's voice is heard as Mr. Fredriksen. It is to the actor's credit to have given his character a human quality that perhaps with another actor would not have the same results. Jordan Nagai lent his voice to Russell, the boy with rare qualities hard to find these days. Christopher Plummer is perfect as the famous Charles Muntz. ""Up"" is an excellent film that will give pleasure to all kinds of audiences as it wants to appeal to the child quality hidden, perhaps, in all of us.","

"Prismark10","21 August 2018","Young Carl idolised explorer Charles Muntz (who somehow looks a lot like Kirk Douglas) and his discovery of Paradise Falls somewhere in South America. Others regarded him as a quack and a fake, so Muntz disappeared. Carl wanted to be an adventurer, he met young Ellie who was even more adventurous but real life got in the way. Now Ellie has passed and Carl is a grumpy old man living alone, hounded by property developers who are bull dozing the neighbourhood and want to see him in a retirement home.Carl has tied his house with loads of helium balloons to float to Paradise Falls. He manages to take with him, an unwitting boy scout Russell who was just helping out an elderly person for a badge.Both find adventures including a rare bird, talking dogs and a fallen hero. More importantly Carl finds a yearning for life as he hangs out with young Russell who himself is freindless.I ended up viewing this film as my wife took our kids to the cinema to watch this and upon her return she told me that I would end being like Carl went I am older. I guess it is a roundabout way of telling me that I am a grouch!The film starts with a segment of Carl and Ellie from childhood to old age. It is the junior Carl who is shy, slightly awkward, a pace or two behind the frenetic and energetic Ellie. As life goes on, they could not have children and it is Ellie who slows down as they get older and she passes on, leaving Carl on his own.It is all about Carl rediscovering that zest for life and having that adventure he and Ellie dreamt about all those years ago. This is a fun and imaginative film, slightly surreal and off beat. For a film called UP it actually keeps its feet on the ground in terms of story and emotion.","

"JoeytheBrit","24 March 2010","Films like Up, with computer-generated animation that captures every tiny human gesture and expression while still presenting a parody of the face and body, are so far removed from traditional animation that they might as well be given a genre of their own. That's not intended to denigrate the work of the likes of Pixar, but simply to point out that what we have here isn't so much another form of animation as another form of non-human images. Where Up! loses the kind of warmth human animators were capable of drawing into their characters, it redeems itself by delivering an emotionally-anchored tale of adventure that relies heavily on it's lead character's melancholy state of mind to keep the audience on board. To this end, Up! is more of an adult's film with elements added to keep the kids entertained rather than the other way around, which is usually the case with films like this.Ed Asner voices the character of Carl Friedrickson, a lonely old man who misses the recently deceased wife he has been with since childhood. He also regrets that they never managed to embark on the kind of adventures they dreamed about when watching newsreel of famous explorer Charles Muntz. All this is shown in an opening vignette that will nail the viewer's backside to their seat more firmly than an entire tub of superglue. Threatened with eviction to an old people's home, Carl decides to launch his house into the sky with the help of 20,000 helium-filled balloons and drift away to Paradise Falls in South America, which was the dream destination of his late wife. Things don't go quite to plan when Carl discovers he has a stowaway on board in the rotund form of Russell, some kind of wildlife ranger who just needs his 'Help the Elderly' badge to become a senior wildlife ranger.Beneath the adventure is the rather less exciting message that it's OK to live a life of ordinariness and routine, and that a life lived with the right person is a journey and adventure in itself (Not quite sure I'm inclined to agree when I'm stuck in a five mile traffic jam on the A428 or washing the dishes, but I'll let that one go). As Russell says, with an innocent insight that belies his youth, it's the small stuff you miss when it's no longer available to you, like sitting on the kerb with your dad, eating ice cream and counting red and blue cars.The film looks incredible, almost to the point that you're drawn away from the story at times to gawp at the growing stubble on the old guy's chin, or the fur on the talking dogs that form the old and embittered Muntz's guard. It isn't really intended to be an out-and-out comedy – it certainly isn't simply out to get as many laughs as it can – but there are a few laugh-out-loud moments and a refreshing lack of sentimentality despite it's essentially emotive subject matter. Definitely worth an hour-and-a-half of anybody's time.","

"anaconda-40658","15 June 2015","Up (2009): Dir: Pete Docter / Voices: Edward Asner, Jordan Nagai, Bob Petersen, Christopher Plummer, Pete Docter: Adventurous animation regarding living life to the fullest. Elderly Carl Fredricksen descends to the air bound for South American Paradise Falls via thousands of balloons lifting his house. He is accompanied by an eight year old kid out for adventure. While third act is ridiculous with dogs flying planes, director Pete Docter is backed with extraordinary visual images. He previously made another inventive Pixar animation called Monsters Inc. Edward Asner voices Carl whose back story is the emotional core. It is a sad yet detailed account of how his childhood love gradually became his wife but their planned trip to Paradise Falls was always prevented. He will now make the trip with Russell and become the father figure he never was. Jordan Nagai voices the enthusiastic Russell whose meaning is obvious. Bob Petersen voices Dug the dog with a voice collar and a better route in life in mind. Christopher Plummer voices the villain whose story is depressing considering his humiliation. His ability to render dogs in flight with speech collars is insane, and his defeat is at the mercy of his accusers. Pete Docter provides the noises of the rare bird in edition to directing this epic animation. The film teaches our potential regardless of our age. Score: 8 / 10","

"pokemon_trainer_lucas","25 June 2019","In all honesty, I have struggled to find an animated film that is as amazing as this one. Up has all of the qualities you could hope for in an animated film; high quality graphics, convincing voice actors, suitability for kids and adults alike, and a compelling storyline. You feel yourself experiencing emotions with the characters as they go through challenging, fun and frightening experiences. The way that this film makes you feel empathy is incredible!My dad, who is renowned for hating animated films, was convinced to watch this with me, my mum and my younger sister, and afterwards he actually admitted to being very impressed and saying that he would happily watch it again in the future! So, even if animation isn't your usual style, I recommend that you take a chance and experience the wonder that is Up.","

"zkonedog","11 March 2017","A few years ago, I watched the film ""Gran Torino"" and was completely blown away by director Clint Eastwood's take on themes such as aging, friendship, and coming to terms with one's own life. However, those who are easily offended (by either harsh language or non-political correctness) would likely not be able to get past those hang-ups, while kids are ruled out altogether. Thankfully, Pixar's ""Up"" explores those same themes in a much more family-friendly fashion.Basically, the story centers on Carl Fredricksen, a senior citizen widower who's being cajoled out of his old relic of a house by construction (""progress"") on all sides of him. Instead of going out smoothly, though, Carl decides (being a retired balloon salesman) to fly his home (via a gaggle of helium balloons!) to Paradise Falls, the mystical place that him and his deceased wife Ellie always dreamed of, but never quite realized. However, there is one hitch in the plan...that being the completely helpless boy scout, Russell, who just happened to be on the wrong porch at the wrong time. As they make their way towards the falls, Carl and Russell encounter a slew of new characters and challenges, making it truly an adventure in every sense of the word.The first level that this film really works at is with the kiddies...the intended viewers. There are enough sight gags (involving the rotund Russell and crotchety Carl) and crazy characters (the talking dog ""Dug""...squirrel!) to keep their interest the whole runtime.However, on a much deeper level, this film will truly move even the most adult of viewers. An amazing sequence towards the beginning of the film depicts the marriage (both the ups and the downs) of Carl and Ellie, and really sets up Carl's character development as he is forced to venture out into the world again and bond with young Russell. With each passing moment (and new adventure), viewers get the feeling that Carl is taking another small step closer to making a clean break from the past and living for the here and now. The scene where he finally realizes that fact is enough to make your eyes begin to water.Thus, I consider ""Up"" to be the pinnacle (at least so far) of animated films for its ability to make you laugh, tantalizing your senses, and really draw you into the characters and their successes/struggles.","

"fernandoschiavi","29 May 2021","Co-written by directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson from a story created by them alongside Thomas McCarthy, Up begins with an absolutely moving sequence that, in just a few minutes, depicts the beautiful love story between Carl Fredricksen and Ellie, from childhood to old age. With an extremely elegant narrative economy, this introduction portrays, almost without any dialogue, the routine of a couple who, dreaming of a trip to South America and a house full of babies, is forced to adapt to reality as they the difficulties and disappointments of everyday life get in the way - and when this sequence comes to an end, not only has the film already won and moved the audience, but it has also established, in an incredibly efficient way, the motivations and personality of the interesting protagonist.Pixar's brilliance, by the way, can already be seen in the confident and intelligent way the narrative is conducted: aware that the intro would likely immerse the audience in a melancholy atmosphere, the filmmakers immediately break the mood with a small visual gag, when Carl , getting out of bed, cracks his spine while trying to stretch his body - and the contrast between this brief moment of humor and the sad scene that came immediately before already establishes Up as a film capable of oscillating with talent between pain and joy.And the drama of ""Up"" is so memorable because in addition to dealing with themes that involve relationships and dreams, the film stars characters generally reneged on the role of supporting actors in cinema - especially in adventure works. Here we have an elderly man and a chubby boy who have experiences that bring out feelings of abandonment, and who together will come together to help each other.With a technical refinement typical of Pixar productions, Up represents the studio's first foray into 3D technology - and it is not for nothing that the film already begins with a metalinguistic joke by displaying ""archive"" images that, through the retreat of the camera, become reveal as scenes projected on a cinema screen, establishing a link between that audience's plunge and our own on our respective big screens. That said, directors never use 3D as an end in itself, using the resource only as a complement to the action - and so instead of relying on objects that seem to jump towards the viewer, Docter and Peterson prefer to deposit their energies in the beautiful production design, as when conceiving an airship whose conventional exterior ends up surprising by housing an internal environment whose narrow corridors end up opening up to impossibly wide spaces. Likewise, the look of the characters is an attraction in itself, from Carl's square face, which contrasts with his impeccably round nose, to the villain Charles Muntz (Plummer's) physiognomy, clearly inspired by Kirk's unmistakable face. Douglas. (Also, notice how the protagonist's beard starts to emerge over time, in a careful detail that serves as a typical example of what separates Pixar from other computer animation companies.)Each character in Up is a class in character building. Carl and Russel are, respectively, the maximum characterization of the grumpy old man and the electric child. Even though these ""reductions"" are clichés, in the skillful hands of Pete Docter and Bob Peterson they become the springboard for two lives separated by many years of experience that gradually converge into a ballet of dialogues and small revelations that he is capable of. Soften the most rigid hearts. Before Scout Russell's arrival, Carl symbolized castration. Carl's old age, at the beginning of the film, is represented by a negative look, of disability and decadence. Carl is grumpy, stubborn, no longer has as much physical independence and does not want to interact socially. The cane and the heavy glasses he carries are symbols of old age and growing physical frailty. In addition to losing his physical and mental vigor, Carl also finds himself facing the loss of autonomy to choose where he wants to live, since he is practically expelled from his own house. The difficult interaction between you and the boy turns out to be permeated with a lot of learning. It is the daily life with Russell that makes Carl change his way of looking at the world and allows him to get the bonds of the past to be able to experience the adventures of the present.An explorer, the boy has the strength and energy that Carl no longer has. He is, in a way, the opposite of him, and reminds Carl of the feelings he had as a child. If Carl symbolizes decay, Russell is the potential, the growth. In an original way, it is Russell, at the height of his childhood, who helps Carl to find his place in the world. The film raises the question of the relationship between the exchange of knowledge between the generations that are at both ends of life. The interactions between Carl and Russell allow both characters to mature. This exchange of experiences promotes an enormous identification with the public and awakens the viewer's memory for the relationships between grandparents and grandchildren or the elderly and children in general.We also have other very pertinent criticisms. The expropriation of Carl's house, made unwillingly by the huge construction company, criticizes the contemporary, capitalist world, which prioritizes profits and sees in the widower's house only a space to increase the building he intends to build. When looking at the space and seeing only good ground for the work, the businessman denies the entire life story of Carl and Ellie, the way they rehabilitated the place and transformed the abandoned building into the family residence for decades. Residence is, therefore, a synthesis of life together.The house has a very strong symbology in the plot: the walls of the house witnessed the whole relationship, from the first day of the meeting - when the two played together with aviators - until the wife's last days. The imagination here is what ends up saving Carl, who uses the skills of the profession he had - he was a balloon salesman -, to literally make his own home take off. The rise of the house by the balloons represents a double solution: on the one hand Carl manages to protect the house as it is, protecting it from the interest of those who wanted to demolish it, and on the other hand, it manages, from within its comfort and space, also fulfill your dream. The house also represents Carl's love for Ellie, which did not end with his wife's death. Taking the house to South America also means, in a way, transporting Ellie to visit the longed-for place of her dreams and to honor her. The character's entry into the new phase of his life can be summed up by the moment when he manages to detach himself from the house, throwing away furniture and other memories that proved his resistance to the past. The new, here, is only possible after Carl learns to deal with the memory of what was left behind.And the drama of ""Up"" is so memorable because in addition to dealing with themes that involve relationships and dreams, the film stars' characters generally reneged on the role of supporting actors in cinema - especially in adventure works. Here we have an elderly man and a chubby boy who have experiences that bring out feelings of abandonment, and who together will come together to help each other. But not everything is perfect. What bothers me the most about ""Up"", is really the forced use of talking dogs, with them flying planes or sitting playing cards. But it also needs to be playful and it is a movie for children too, so I understand the purpose of such scenes and in the general balance it does not harm the drama or detract from the merits of the adventure.We also have other obvious problems, which is a pity - and the most disappointing of these concerns the unimaginative way in which the directors conceive the ""locations"" of the film: if we could initially assume that the Paradise dreamed by Carl and Ellie would prove to be a breathtaking place, so we are forced to realize that it is nothing more than a rocky and lifeless environment, wasting the chance that the feature film would have to dazzle us visually (and, in this respect, Up is one of Pixar's most bureaucratic jobs ). As if that wasn't enough, the relationship between Carl and Russell sounds schematic, made even more artificial given the confusing and clichéd way the script portrays the problems the boy faces with his father. And what can I say about the fate of the evil Muntz, who follows the same beaten path as so many other Disney villains?In fact, despite all the atmosphere of adventure and fiction present in the narrative, above all ""Up"" is a story about moving forward and building simple moments with important people. We often seek the grand, but the simple can be the essential that is often not valued, or invested. Up maintains Pixar's tradition of using its light stories to address surprisingly adult themes - and here perhaps the studio attacks one of the most difficult of them: the expectation of the human being in the face of their own dreams and loss. In trying to fulfill what he had promised Ellie, Carl is obviously seeking to recover the closeness he had with his wife, as if reaching the Paradise Falls (meaningful name, this) could bring some kind of comfort to his loss - and by stating that his loneliness and his pain remain unchanged, the protagonist has no choice but to continue living.Joining The Tomb of Fireflies and The Lion King on the list of animations capable of bringing adults to endless tears, Up - is another example of how Pixar digitally manages to build what most filmmakers contemporaries fail to create with real actors: stories and characters full of humanity and sweetness.","

"tedg","15 June 2009","Pixar has its first truly Disney project. It has all the hallmarks of the Pixal manual: it is obsessed with exploring the third dimension and it has an extremely refined engineering of story. It touches on thoroughly conventional family values in a slightly new way. And it has a strangely relevant short that precedes it.In this case, the three dimensional explorations that Pixar mastered are rendered in visual three D because Disney's corporate strategy requires it. Its a massive shame. That's because of the unintuitive fact that of all the exploration and innovation that Pixar has done has to do with novelties of the projection into a 2-d screen with a frame. The frame , usually constrained by the physics of the camera, has a broader physics in Pixar-land. But to get audiences to ""read"" the 3D, these extended physics are taken away and what we have is ordinary camera movement and framing.I may have a different experience when I see this in 2D, but I think not. All the cinematic fun, the adventure of the Pixar spirit, is missing here.The one thing that is outside the normal Pixar range is the color palette. It much richer here than usual. I think that may have also to do with Disney strategies for dealing with technology threats.The child here is Asian. That's also a market driven decision.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","

"moonspinner55","22 August 2010","The opening eleven minutes of Disney/Pixar's animated ""Up"" are pure poetry in motion. Chronicling a man's journey in life from boyhood to married adult to lonely widower, director Pete Docter gives us images which are extraordinarily heartfelt, so elegiac in tone they should take an audience's collective breath away. Big dreamers but relative homebodies, an elderly man and his wife live happily together alone in their house until her passing. Faced with eviction, the man gets an amazing idea overnight: attach thousands of helium-filled balloons to his rickety old house and sail it through the air to a revered point in South America. But, as with 2008's ""WALL·E"", there has to be dramatic conflict, a villain, a chase, and lots of outrageous comedy in order to attract the youthful target audience. In a perfect world, there would be a Pixar effort designed to steadfastly avoid this kind of commercial pandering to 10-year-olds. Once the house reaches the next continent, the man, now joined by a chatty juvenile, encounters a rare bird being hunted by a world-renown explorer--the 78-year-old's childhood hero--who fails to live up to his newsreel notoriety. The bird only wants to get back to her babies in their nest (how's that for conflict?), while the man and his kid-companion are held off by a pack of dogs who have voice-boxes in their collars. If this isn't bad enough, at one point the dogs even prove to be flying aces in fighter planes apparently held in storage since WWI (it's a lackluster homage to ""King Kong"", and a highly unnecessary one). The screenplay, written by Pete Docter and his assistant Bob Peterson from a treatment by Docter, Peterson and Thomas McCarthy, is so wonderfully cognizant of an elderly person's traits and attachments to their beloved belongings, to then witness the central character being chased by talking dogs is an insult. And yet, because the filmmakers are wise enough to keep returning to the tale's likable principles, ""Up"" is often vastly entertaining. The detail is marvelous, often beautiful, as is the subtle music score by Michael Giacchino. There are a handful of near-terrible moments in the film which keep it from being a true masterpiece, but Docter and his team are surprisingly honest when it comes to the sentiment. The friendships made and lost in ""Up"" are genuinely touching; and, though the slapstick is noisy and sometimes mean-spirited, the overall intent to somehow steer this vessel to a happily-ever-after ending is clearly evident and commendable. *** from ****","

"ethanbresnett","7 May 2021","What makes Up so great is that it is rooted in such grounded and relatable human emotions. This wanderlust in all of us. This desire to experience things, see the world, live life to the fullest, and to do it with someone we love. All of this makes Carl a very relatable character and one that we can connect to almost instantly. Russell is a bit annoying at times and is there to appeal to the younger audience, but I grew to love him over the course of the film.The central idea is just pure Pixar genius and so full of magic and joy. I defy anyone not to crack a huge smile when that house starts to float. The plot is pretty standard Pixar, following the usual formula and with similar themes. It's very enjoyable, with a great pace to it and a terrific arc for our protagonist.As ever with a Pixar film, the voice performances could not be better. The animation is just breath taking. Some of the cloud animation could have been real, it is just so well done. The use of colour and sound in Up are also magnificent. It's just such a joy to look at.I do think this film is *slightly* over hyped, but maybe that's just because I was over 10 years late to the party watching it.Yet another Pixar gem!","

"Zac_La_Porte","15 June 2022","Up doesn't just go up and down, it goes in so many different directions with emotion, imagination and sentimentalism. It's exactly what makes this animated Disney-Pixar adventure so entertaining, fulfilling and enjoyable to watch... Well, that's only IF you can properly make it through the first 10 minutes, although it'll make you ball your eyes out.The plot of the movie consists of a 78-year-old balloon salesman grieving over the death of his wife, but also going on to fulfil their lifelong dream: to fly their house to Paradise Falls. He is accompanied by a small boy named Russell and a cuddly dog named Dug who they encounter on the way. However, the fact that he's run a balloon vendor doesn't matter, and the film's just about his eventful and imaginative adventure to Paradise Falls.This movie will entertain and please everyone of all ages. The story is high on creativity, heavy on emotions, very sweet and uplifting, although it's tearjerking. The animation in this movie is just wonderful. All the story's ideas are visually captured with memorable colours and bright skies. The music is also masterful, heartbreaking at times but also unforgettable. This may be the best music used in animated kids' movies.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

"tieman64","7 November 2009","The Walt Disney company released a series of somewhat ""groundbreaking"" animated films between 1937 and 1942 (""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Bambi"", ""Dumbo"" etc). Thereafter it degenerated into a purveyor of a formulaic, predictable and increasingly saccharine features. Over the decades it became nothing less than a cultural force, plucking stories from countries all over the world and then skewing them until they fit the ""Disney formula"". Eventually Disney seemed to have stopped making animated films altogether. Each new release was simply an addition to some already existent, homogeneous, ""Disney Land"". This is a land of fairy tales, princes and princesses, wicked stepmothers, dead parents, song and dance numbers, bumbling sidekicks, lots of anthropomorphic charm, the ubiquitous fear of separation and punishment, and some pretty despicable values relating to gender, monarchs and class. Eventually it got to the point where it didn't matter what Disney's films were about. All that mattered were that they conformed to the rules of ""Disney Land"". The stories, the characters, the customer expectations, the brand awareness, all coalesced to form a kind of bland corporate mission statement.Gradually the company began to shamelessly use its commitment to ""wholesome"" entertainment to market an endless array of toys, gadgets and clothes to children. It all seemed quite innocuous, but beneath Disney's self-proclaimed role as an icon of culture, lies a powerful educational apparatus that provides ideologically loaded fantasies for children and adults alike. Fantasy, for Disney, has no basis in reality, no sense of real conflicts, struggles, motivations or social relations. Instead, ""fantasy"" becomes a marketing device, a form of hype rooted solely in the logic of self-interest and buying. In the early 1990s, Disney received praise for films like ""The Lion King"" and ""Beauty and The Beast"". The studio had re-found its form, some said. By the time Pixar Studios had established itself as a brand in the late 90s, however, Disney had once again lost its cool factor. Burnt by poor box-office returns, the company started making sequels to its more popular animations and began releasing them solely on DVD or TV. Much later they'd begin gobbling up outside mega-franchises (Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars etc).Pixar's evolution very much mirrors Disney's. After a string of somewhat revolutionary films, and Brad Bird's two fairly personal features, Pixar has begun a slow spiral into mediocrity, ""Cars"", ""WALL-E"" and ""Up"" representing the company on a downward slope.""Up"" is about an elderly man and young boy who travel to South America and have a series of adventures. It's a consistently funny film, but virtually every character here is contrived and understood entirely in one dimensional terms. An old man lost his wife, a wife lost her child, a young boy lost his father, a talking dog is bullied by other dogs, a giant bird is separated from its offspring...every single character seems cynically designed or calibrated to quickly illicit unearned sentiment. Pixar's last film, ""WALL-E"", was no different, death (there are about 4 death scenes in that film), loneliness and loss rolled out like Pavlovian commands. See, ""WALL-E"" is dead, why not shed a tear? See, the old man lost his wife, why not weep? Of course Pixar's films have always been sentimental, but they were sentimental in subtler or original ways. Think the smile which ends ""Monster's Inc"", the food critic's flashback at the end of ""Rattatoille"" or the brief shot of unhatched eggs in ""Finding Nemo"".Ignoring Pixar's emotional regression, its plots have also become increasingly generic. ""Up"" in particular feels like a cocktail of bits and pieces plucked from ""Ice Age 3"", ""The House of Small Cubes"", ""The Red Balloon"", ""Fitzcarraldo"", ""King Kong"" etc. For a film which features an airship called ""The Spirit of Adventure"", the film is strangely cowardly, content to trade in stock characters and lazy chase scenes. Elsewhere the film champions adventure with one hand whilst exalting the return to Norman Rockwellesque normalcy; everyday life, we learn, is adventure enough. And those who go off on mighty exhibitions go insane anyway. This is very much the Pixar formula. Pixar's characters live in a small world, discover a bigger world outside of their familiar surroundings, and then retreat quickly back to the box. Beyond all this, ""Up"" is Pixar's attempt to outright mimic Hayao Miyazaki (the director of ""Up"" directed the English voice dubs of Miyazaki's ""Howl's Moving Castle"", another film with old people in a moving house). Pixar/Disney chief John Lasseter has often cited Miyazaki as a key influence on Pixar, but Miyazaki's films have a subtlety and sense of auteurism that these latest Pixar offerings lack. Observe, for example, the gorgeous flying scenes in ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""Nausica"", ""Castle In the Sky"" and ""Porcco Rosso"". In comparison, the ""flying"" scenes in ""Up"" are strangely inert. While previous Pixar films have exploited space to great effect, ""Up"" is awash with flat compositions and ordinary camera work.Still, the film has some good moments, most of them occurring in ""Up's"" first half. Here we're treated to several clever visuals, jokes and powerful montages, some of which seem cribbed from Kunio Kato's ""The House of Small Cubes"" and Michael Apted's ""Up"", the latter a noteworthy documentary series which chronicles the lives of several human beings, from cradle to grave. It's all very sad.7.9/10 - Worth one viewing. See ""From Up on Poppy Hill"", ""The Girl who Leapt through Time"" and ""The King of Pigs"".","

"dunmore_ego","26 June 2010","The madmen at Pixar once again prove themselves the best storytellers on the planet. Or off it.UP is a unique animated adventure that follows crusty retiree Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) on his adventures in trying to float his house with thousands of balloons to his dream locale.Another humbling display of Pixar's incredible grasp of story structure. How do Pixar do it? Look at their ratings record on IMDb - every major theatrical release (except CARS) scores 8/10 or above. From TOY STORY to THE INCREDIBLES to WALL-E, it is becoming boring referring to them ""batting another out of the park."" They know no other trajectory.The first section of the movie is a sad little vignette all on its own. We first meet Carl as a cute little boy, marveling at the exploits of adventurer Charles Muntz (voice of Christopher Plummer). Also a fan of Muntz, Carl's future wife, Ellie (Elie Docter), whom he Meets Cute in a dilapidated house, as she pretends to fly it to an enigmatic South American rainforest plateau called Paradise Falls. A whirlwind montage of Ellie's and Carl's lives as they marry, move into that house and try to keep ends met while still vowing to trek to Paradise Falls ""someday."" He's a balloon salesman at the zoo, while she works in the South American exhibit. Montage rushes through their married life, dark days of miscarriage, old age, and finally Ellie's death, throughout, a picture of their promised destination on the mantel seeming to recede further into childhood fantasy. It stirs simultaneous nostalgia, bereavement and regret.And it's just a cartoon! As city developers tear down everything around Carl's little house, he resolves to make his fantasy a reality. He attaches thousands of air balloons to his house, rends it from its moorings and takes to the skies, with ingenious steering and sailing mechanisms that were once merely play-acting ropes for young Ellie.Along for the ride is a plump little Asian-American boy scout, Russell (Jordan Nagai), who was on Carl's porch when he lifted off. It is refreshing that Pixar would create this mixed-ethnicity character, as it has always been the provenance of spoiled blond white kids (which Carl was in the opening scenes) to go on adventures such as these.En route to the Falls, Carl and Russell encounter a big exotic bird which Russell names Kevin (and continues to call it that even after it is discovered the bird is a mother), a dog named Dug with a special collar that enables him to speak (voice of co-writer-director Bob Peterson) and Muntz himself as a neurotic recluse with his pack of trained collar-speaking hounds.Using the word ingenious to describe Pixar is like using skank to describe Britney Spears - it's intrinsic; built into every detail of this production, from the logistics of Carl's balloon-powered house to Muntz's airship, to the house-airship chase through canyons, and the endearing little animation details.Characterizations are, once again, as good as you will find in any drama. Though the movie obviously has a strong kiddie demographic, Russell's pathological need to earn his badges to impress his absent father is far from the usual syrupy guff. And watch how artfully Dug's lovable character is carved out in a few seconds of screen time, through his actions, voice and content of his disjointed dialog--squirrel! This is why Pixar shames Disney when it comes to writing ""real"" characters - Disney's are STILL written as naively as Amy Adams plays Giselle in ENCHANTED (2007).Pixar writing vets Pete Docter (TOY STORY, MONSTERS, INC) and Bob Peterson (FINDING NEMO) direct, with Thomas McCarthy sharing co-writing credits with them. Creating an action-adventure without overpowering the people at the heart of it.UP was recommended to me by a screenwriter as an example of the perfect execution of the screenplay form. It is. A whip-cracking put-us-in-our-place illustration of just how a story should be told, with humor, action, poignancy, and every little detail paid off--squirrel!","

"colinrgeorge","6 April 2010","""Up"" may be more emotionally charged than previous Pixar efforts, though almost exclusively in its first act, and is nevertheless a step down in storytelling for the company that last year brought us ""Wall-E"" and before that ""Ratatouille."" ""Up"" suffers in comparison to those films, and happily resigns itself from 'good Pixar' to regular good.The story follows reluctant protagonist Carl Fredrickson, a 78-year old balloon salesman, who along with his now-departed wife, always dreamt of flying to adventure in Paradise Falls, South America. During a moving, poignant montage of his life, it becomes clear that the opportunity for adventure is passing the couple by. So when the widower Carl is sued and his home threatened, he takes the opportunity to take off, the house held afloat by thousands upon thousands of colorful balloons for the adventure he never had. All goes according to plan until he discovers Russell, an overeager ""wilderness explorer,"" has stowed away beneath his porch.The second act is the film's weakest, and the adventure advertised boils down to a few paltry miles. After a brief storm sequence, the unlikely pair find themselves on the other side of the canyon, but nevertheless ""three days"" from Paradise Falls. With the floating home strapped to their backs, Carl and Russell begin their trek, only to be sidetracked by the obligatory supporting characters, amusing though they may be: ""Kevin"" a fictional female dodo-like bird with hilarious favoritism, and ""Doug"" a golden retriever with a dog-to-English translation collar.Where the film finds itself in trouble is in keeping the established themes at the forefront of the story when the arbitrary sequence of events in the second act unfold. The villain, Carl's childhood idol (which makes this guy how old?), a disgraced adventurer by the name of Charles Muntz, is the perfect match as a man who's been corrupted by his dreams, but he's never developed to a satisfying level and receives relatively little screen time.Muntz's minions are a wellspring of only occasionally successful gags, an armada of translation-collared dogs tasked with hunting down Carl, Russell, and most importantly, Kevin. Their presence in the film feels somewhat random, and not quite funny enough to justify. It's becoming an ironically dirty word in reference to Pixar's work, but it all feels a little too cartoony.The visuals are as strong as the best Pixar has offered, though shot composition gives everything a sort of flat feel to it (a problem perhaps 3-D was meant to rectify), with characters seldom moving on more than one plane, leaving the environments feeling oddly like stage backdrops.""Up"" is sadly Pixar's last original film until 2013, but with its glaring screenplay problems, it may be for the best that the studio recharge its creative cannons. After ten feature films, nine completely original, it's hard to leverage complaints against ""Up"" greater than that it simply isn't their best work. It may not be the revelation that ""Ratatouille"" or ""Wall-E"" were, but middle of the road Pixar is still worth the price of admission.","

"Buddy-51","27 July 2009","For a few perilous moments in the middle of ""Up,"" I began to suspect that the folks at Pixar just might be about to register their first major stumble in the studio's hitherto flawless reign as ""king"" of the computer-animated film (a reign which began with ""Toy Story"" all the way back in 1995). But, like the airborne house that floats at the center of the story, the movie eventually righted itself and sailed off smoothly into the wild blue yonder.This generally wistful and enchanting film tells the tale of Carl Fredricksen, a grumpy old man whose beloved wife, Ellie, has recently died, taking their dream - of traveling to South America, to a place called Paradise Falls, and setting up home there - to the grave with her. When Carl is threatened with eviction, he hatches a fantastical scheme of attaching hundreds of helium-filled balloons to the house and flying to South America on sheer wind power alone. This he does, accompanied by an adorable little tyke named Russell, who just happens to be caught under the porch at the moment of liftoff.So far, so good, as ""Up"" captivates us completely with its imagination, its lyricism and its charm, along with its visual homage to such earlier classics as ""The Red Balloon,"" ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Around the World in 80 Days."" There's also a stunning montage sequence which chronicles - without narration or dialogue - the complete married life of the Fredricksens, starting with their wedding and ending in Ellie's eventual death.The trouble for ""Up"" begins to rear its ugly head only after Carl and Russell have arrived at their intended destination. Here they are confronted by a number of strange and exotic creatures, including a hitherto unclassified species of bird and a bunch of dogs who've been given the ability to speak by some sort of shadowy mad scientist who's clearly up to no good in this remote corner of the world. At times, we begin to suspect that once the writers, Bob Petersen and Pete Docter, came up with the idea of launching an old Victorian house into the stratosphere, they never really figured out what to do with it once they got it up there. But the messy mixture of science fiction and jungle melodrama they've come up with is unworthy of all the quality work that has come before it.Yet, what eventually saves ""Up"" from crashing and burning in its second half is the wonderful voice work by Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai, the soaring and sweetly romantic score by Michael Giacchino, and the theme that sometimes our yearning for adventure can make us so myopic that we fail to perceive the ""adventure"" that's happening right in front of our eyes on a day-by-wonderful-day basis (more shades of ""The Wizard of Oz""). These alone are enough to compensate for the occasional narrative misfires, a made-to-order villain, and an overabundance of drooling, snarling pooches that feel strangely out-of-place in a tender and lyrical fable such as this one.The animation and backgrounds aren't quite as rich and compelling as they were in Pixar's previous two ventures, ""Ratatoille"" and ""Wall-E,"" but the less spectacular look actually makes ""Up"" a more contemplative, relaxing work to sit through.","

"Jerique","30 March 2011","This movie isn't what I expected. There was a lot of talk about this movie and a lot of hype brought from it during its release year. It's a great kids film and it even holds a lot of comedy for adults.I had a lot of fun and enjoyed a lot of the great comedy throughout this movie, even though it's filled with a lot of sadness. It has a cliché montage in the first ten minutes to show a lot of time passing and allow for the main character of Carl to be old.Russel is quite a show-stealing character with his comedic relief and the dog Dug who is a hyper-active upbeat talking dog helps give some comedy too. It's really unlimited in terms of comedy.It's got a tad bit of romance, and it's filled with tragedy for more than one character. It's a fun movie full of heart. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm sad I didn't take a look at it in 2009 when it came out. But I'm glad I finally saw it. It's one of the best Pixar has ever had to offer.","

"CA_movie_fan","12 May 2009","Pixar has become the most dependable studio out there for producing reliable films that don't simply continue to raise the bar in animation but set a level of excellence in storytelling that puts most live-action movies to shame. 'Up' represents another change in style, as significant as Wall-E's shift to photorealism, intricate camera effects and darker themes. It effectively blends moments of tragedy with almost slapstick humor, while showing that their understanding of story structure and pacing gets more refined with every release.Up is about a 70-something ex-balloon salesman who fulfills a lifelong dream of adventure by tying thousands of balloons to his house and flying away to South America. This trip, inspired by his adventure- loving wife who dies before their dream is realized, is forced when property developers attempt a compulsory purchase on his house and try to move him to a retirement home (issues of death and eminent domain in a cartoon?). The problem is that he has an enthusiastic - and fatherless - 8-year old Wildness Explorer stowed away on the property when it takes off. Their adventure focuses on the characters they meet along the way, while our hero Carl is still trying to drag his house to the dream destination at the top of a waterfall.The opening shows the life of Carl, growing from an young boy, meeting his adventuring-loving girlfriend, their marriage and her death just before their adventure starts - it's an incredibly emotional 5-minute intro that's light on dialog and heavy on visuals, and didn't leave a dry eye in the theater. This sequence in particular was reminiscent of the dialog-free sections of Wall-E which deliver their plot punches without exposition or the need for endless sequences that would take twice as long in live action. But this approach doesn't leave the younger audience behind either, and for such a dark start, all I could see in the audience were kids and adults alike glued to the screen.I won't give away any more plot details since the film doesn't open for another three weeks, but every scene and character trait is meticulously plotted so that nothing seems too ridiculous or contrived, even for such a fantastic journey. The graphic stylization is also fresh, in the same way that The Incredibles had a very distinct and authentic look. All of this serves to heighten the humor and there are some extremely funny scenes, helped by the way the characters are quickly and believably established (even the talking dogs, but you'll see what I mean).This is the second time I've been to Pixar to see a pre-release of a movie and I felt a little scared before seeing this one, wondering if their run of first-class work may have hit a plateau. On the surface, I didn't really think a story about a senior in a flying house could live up to Wall-E, yet although the films are as different as they can be, Up is as gripping and entertaining as any Pixar film. Their ability to blends styles and take the audience from laughter to tears in minutes showcases their deep understanding of story, and it's a shame that more films aren't crafted the same way.Up opens on May 29, and I highly recommend it to everyone. The next two films out of Pixar will be Toy Story 3 (2010) and Cars 2 (2011). By the way, look at for a very funny short film before Up called Partly Cloudly.","

"Turfseer","2 June 2009","It's gotten to the point that most people assume that whatever Pixar does, it's going to hit a home run. But in the case of their latest 3-D animated story, ""Up"", I'm sad to report that this new Pixar concoction does not live up to the all the hype. For those who are watching a Pixar animated film for the first time, of course 'Up' will seem quite impressive. After all, no other studio comes close to Pixar when it comes to the technical aspects of animation. But ultimately, whether a film is animated or not, it's the story and the characters that make a film great.It was a bold move to choose an octogenarian as the film's protagonist—on the surface the crotchety curmudgeon, Carl Fredrickson, the elderly Spencer Tracy look-a-like, is the type of character we haven't seen before especially in an animated film. And 'Up' starts off with two very neat scenes: 1) a take-off on the old Movietone newsreels a la Citizen Kane and 2) a lovely montage sequence which chronicles the graceful aging of Carl and Ellie, the girl he's known since childhood, who becomes his wife.The montage sequence is notably silent and doesn't allow for much character development as to what makes Carl tick. It seems he was always introverted but seemingly happy until Ellie's death. It's perhaps suggested that loneliness has turned Carl into a curmudgeon but with all those happy memories of Ellie, I wonder why he turned into such a sour puss. And that essentially is the problem for most of the film: Carl is simply not very likable. He spends most of his time not acting very nice to Russell, the Explorer Scout stowaway, until the film's climax. But it's quite predictable when Carl finally learns the all-important life lesson that it's much better to be empathetic than uncaring.'Up' is similar to Pixar's prior effort, ""Wall-e', in that it takes too long to introduce the film's antagonist. In Wall-e, we spend a little too much time observing Wall-e as earth's last operable trash compactor. But even those activities prove to be far more interesting than the flying house in 'Up'. After about five minutes, the house with the balloons becomes tiresome; it's not a very clever idea to begin with and all the smashups as it makes it way to South America, prove to be more repetitious than Wall-e's penchant for turning mounds of junk into perfect cubes.When we finally meet up with the long lost ""Man of Adventure', Charles Muntz, and we saw that Muntz was already probably 30 years old in the newsreel at the beginning of the film, then we must conclude Muntz would be at least 110 years old when he meets up with Carl. But he doesn't look a day older than 90! Muntz at least has a little more personality than Carl but he's much too mean a character for such a light-hearted story. For all parents who plan to take their young children to see 'Up', be forewarned: Muntz and his talking dogs are vicious and wholly inappropriate for your young children who will probably leave the movie theater quite scared and some even crying! The giant dodo-like bird, Kevin, is much more appropriate for the kids but when Muntz's pit bulls start attacking him in old-fashioned bi-planes (straight out of King Kong), the charm flies out the door.The film's denouement wouldn't have been so bad had the adventure in South America been a little more engaging. There were just too many scenes of Carl and Russell tethered to the house, huffing and puffing as they try to reach the illusory waterfalls along with the talking dogs. The rest of it was perfectly acceptable: Carl becomes the good guy, realizes that the reaching his goal was an illusion and bonds with Russell back home. The best part of the film are the closing credits which give us a sneak peak into Carl and Russell's life after their return to the 'ordinary world'.In the end, 'Up' is a tale of political correctness. Two outsiders, the elderly Carl and the obesity challenged Wilderness Explorer Russell, are able to not only defeat pure evil but overcome both the forces of nature and their own limitations. For Carl it's his self-pity and for Russell it's his lack of self-confidence. Ultimately 'Up' falls 'down' since it's all rather predictable stuff. Pixar has become complacent, simply resting on its laurels. There is only one direction Pixar can go from now onand that is up!","

"Prince-P","15 July 2022","As a kid Peter Docter fantasized about being able to drift far away when he found himself in difficult, social situations. The future director often hoped that his childhood home would somehow lift off the ground and fly him to a happier place.An idea Peter Docter then turned into a movie.

However, just as a violent storm carries the airborne building to South America, Carl discovers that he's got an unexpected stowaway.Unfortunately, not everyone at the film company was happy about Peter Docter's idea. Many worried that people would have a hard time accepting a grumpy old man in the lead role. It took the director weeks to convince his bosses that the audience would probably perceive Carl Fredricksen as a nice old relative instead.And he was right.

"aharmas","31 May 2009","Once again, I shouldn't have trusted that preview, or it might have been that the short before ""Up"" was so wonderful, or was it that the mostly silent introduction to our main character was nothing short of glorious... somewhere, though, this film lost its ability to touch in the way other Pixar and animated features have done in the past.""Up"" is supposedly about achieving our dreams, discovering who we really are, learning to adapt to the changes life brings to us, and so many other themes that it is a wonder we even recognize them, as the film changes from an intimate portrayal of two lonely people to a rather hectic adventure that barely rises above average.The animation is, of course, superb, and the vocal work by all the people involved is first-rate. Problems arise when we notice than other than the amazing prologue, most of the good stuff has already been show in the preview. The other sections don't quite muster enough emotional power to make us care. For instance, the vistas aren't impressive, the set action pieces near the end don't carry much wallop, and it's hard to have a movie that lacks. The film just feels like some non-threatening film that is paying tribute to movies that had originality and the right tone. I couldn't help wondering what people like Spielberg and Zemeckis could have done with this movie, and the echoes of ""Wall-e"" kept haunting me, as I remembered the lyricism of that movie that made us remember what it is like to be human in the middle of all these choking technology. ""Up"" doesn't quite take you up for the ride, or make you feel ""up"". There is no cathartic moment, no real payoff, and the best moments are the sentimental moments when pictures of their loving relationship is on the screen.Marketing can do wonders, and this will be a huge moneymaker. Hopefully it will only receive the credit it really deserves, and audiences will be wiser so next, we enjoy something beyond a small, sweet film that couldn't quite give us what we expected.","

"gerbinator2009","4 June 2009","The negative reviews for this are horrible. The story was not too sad. It was like life is for old people. Their spouse dies, and they live by themselves. That, however, did not happen to Carl Fredrickson. He meets a lively adventurous little boy, and has a fantastic, exciting, and yes perilous adventure in the place of his childhood dreams. This adventure is in the loving memory of his wife, and although he starts out thinking the little boy is an annoyance, they become almost family by the end of the story. This is not a sad story. It is about a lonely old man, and a boy from a broken family making an unlikely and meaningful friendship. If anyone, says this story is too sad, I point to the ending. Was it sad? No. People compare this to the masterpiece of Wall-E which I think was equally if not more sad. Earth is an inhospitable wasteland, mankind turns into lazy useless blobs. Only at the end of that story is it happy and hopeful, which is the same for UP. UP is an UPlifting masterpiece about hope, friendship, adventure, and love.","

Enter eight year old Russell (Jordan Nagai), a stowaway on Carl's flying house as they float with thousands of balloons to South America to fulfill Carl's commitment to his dead wife to find adventure.Enter Pixar's expertise at fashioning character out of animation: Carl's expressions are so true to an old man's disappointments and lost dreams that the animation medium is benignly lost to the humanity. Enter Carl's traveling buddy, Russell, a pudgy scout with uncertain Asian influences in his genes, who earns the equivalent of a Boy Scout badge by helping Carl travel to a remote falls in South America to fulfill the dream of his deceased wife to live there.Besides the 3-D loving color and careening objects, directors Peter Docter and Bob Petersen explore the universal need for meaning in life beyond the accumulation of things and the old man/young man dynamic without maudlin musings. Add another old man to the mix, explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), who simply means for Pixar another chance to consider the need of old men to find final meaning, a philosophical closure, in their descending lives.Up is a summer upper.

"haydenluz","5 January 2021","The five brains of Docter, Stanton, Lasseter, Peterson & McCarthy, put out yet another heartfelt and moving, family-fun adventure film! They incorporated a lot of emotional notes, with some great laughs! The first act is the best first act Pixar has ever put out! It gets the audience connected and invested so fast, by using detailed flashbacks to set up a sentimental montage; making us truly care for our main protagonist, Carl Fredrickson.Carl Fredrickson, voiced by Ed Asner, had the most pronounced character arch, being a character you truly cared about the whole time, despite his negative attitude half of the time. He brings a lot of mature wit to the film, dishing out the harsh truth at times. Russell, voiced by Jordan Nasgai is a loud, yet optimistic & charming character, that had great merit. He may have gotten to be a tad annoying as the film proceeds, but he is a fantastic addition to Carl. Charles F. Muntz, voiced by Christopher Plummer, is our main antagonist. He really wasn't anything special, or unpredictable; he just served his purpose at a surface level. Dug, voiced by Bob Peterson was nothing but a fury enjoyment at first, but ended up having great character development, and a respectable place in the film. Kevin is just one of those animals, Pixar continues to throw into films, that they try to make important. Kevin was better than most animal additions, but I didn't truly care for his reason, or his character at all.The cinematography and animation created this very vibrant and colorful film. The animations were beautifully detailed, along side the breathtaking backdrops and scenery.Although Up has a lot of entertaining moments, it doesn't come without a few bumps in the road. Even though the opening act is one of the best we've seen from Pixar, it's really hard to keep that pace up for the whole run time. Up does it's best to do just that, but does slack in some areas. With Pixar, they create these mental obstacles that you need to be able to overlook, and in Up's case, it has a few easy nitpicks. I had no problems overlooking some obstacles, but they incorporated a lot of stretched out abilities, with the leeway they were already granted. Another strange thing they did was create a few counteracting tones, trying to be poignant at some points, but silly throughout most of the film.Overall, Up is one of Pixar's finest, and belongs in the top ten!","

It does actually give the impression that some thought has gone into it not to say daring in the storyline of a widower realizing - in the nick of time to borrow Noel Coward's phrase - that life is for living and lighting out in a house propelled by helium-filled balloons for South America. Not least effective is a lovely montage sequence that takes our hero from childhood through dating, marriage and loss of his much-loved wife. To put this at the top of the show and risk alienating the kids was brave indeed. The 'action' may take some swallowing - we are, after all, talking geriatric here - but is easily overlooked. A fine effort.","

"Vic_max","6 June 2009","Perhaps the best part of this movie was the beginning, but after that, it was really more like a long kid's cartoon. Sorry - I know lots of people (including critics) love this film, but I'm just calling it as I saw it. There were no earth-shattering scenes that I'm replaying in my mind, quotable quotes that I will quote one day, nor mind-blowing visuals that I will tantalizingly dwell on. For me, it was just a good movie, nothing more.A lot of this movie is like Wall-E. There's a lot of focus on a few main characters and their quirky behaviors and mannerisms. If you like that sort thing, great! The action-oriented plot that comes later in the movie was good, but again, not quite great.A real disappointment was the mysterious, goofy bird that was being sought after in the jungle. A mysterious exotic 'creature' or something would have been far engaging. Instead, we get an ungainly, multi-colored bird that's kind of a cross between an ostrich and the cocoa-puffs cereal bird.3D: This movie was pretty tame in its use of 3D. It's there, but after 10 minutes, I'll it kind of fades to the background. Just a day later, I remember the film only as a 2 dimensional movie, not a 3D one.Soooo ... what do I recommend? I recommend seeing it! Even though I give it a 6/10, I know that my view is in the minority of viewers and that the likelihood that the average movie-goer will like it is high.What I would recommend is, if you care to, give it a fair critical shake after you see it. Think about best movies you have ever seen - remember them clearly, and then ask ... was this one of them ... really?","

"revival05","6 March 2010","Walt Disney once said that he wanted to make movies for audiences, not just kids. His goal was to produce animated film equal to live action features, movies that were seen and appreciated just like any other movies. One can certainly discuss how well the Disney studio has taken care of this legacy, but the company that kept the innovation going for it has obviously been Pixar. Step by step, movie by movie, the people at Pixar have kept outdoing themselves. To me, Wall-E was them crossing the final frontier, breaking their own roof and kept going towards the stars. That wasn't just a family adventure and it wasn't a kids movie. It was about two machines and the entire human race - a movie for audiences, don't you think?Up is a companion piece on the same level. It's not about the entire human race, but it's about the entire life of a human being - this is a movie that tries to learn very young people a little something about very old people. In the beginning of the movie we meet Carl, a little toddler with stars in his eyes, dreaming about going out into the world for adventure. Coming home from a Newsreel concerning his biggest adventurer hero, he passes a house where adventurous things seem to be in full motion. Thus, he meets Ellie, a happy gal with equally grand dreams as himself. Now, in any other animated movie this would be our two main characters, kids on the screen for kids in the theater to relate to. But what follows is a montage, spawning decades, and upon the end of this montage we meet our main protagonist - it's Carl alright, but now he's Mr. Fredricksen, a cranky old man. The movie has just outrun the eight year olds by 70 years or so! Hey little Charlie, this is your life Mr. Fredricksen. It's dangerously brilliant.Our cranky old hero has a warm and colorful life behind him, but he never got to go out on any of those adventures. While there's still time, and while there's certainly nothing better to do, Carl figure it's time for some adventure so he flies away in his house toward South America, the land of his dreams. His only baggage is Russell, the real kid for the kids in the audience to ""relate"" to. Carl finds him obnoxious and even though Russell is your average modern eight year old, I guess the real modern eight year olds in the movie house should understand why by now. Back in the days, all Carl and Ellie knew about South America was that it was ""America, only south"". Russell takes GPS for granted and says ""You're going to South America? You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you'll have all your TV and clocks and stuff."" Russell doesn't seem to have any pure, authentic dreams of adventure in him, and he's certainly not that imaginative, but he does like chocolate.What follows is an adventure as old fashioned as it is fun and original. There's something very classical about the whole fair; an amazing flying machine that has to be repaired somehow, strange dangers in the jungle and giant zeppelins with the insides of luxurious steamboats. In a sense, this is also an adventure movie about adventure movies - it's part of the adventure to explore jungles, discover strange animals and exciting secrets. Carl knew this when he was eight but now, almost eighty, it's all just a nuisance. He is totally uninterested in whatever they discover. ""Can we keep it?"" Russell says. ""No"" Carl keeps replying and continues to limp along. ""But it's a talking dog!!"" Russell finally exclaims.Up also has fairy tale touch to it that is woven into the visual dynamic. It feels as if it's taken inspiration both from the films of Miyazaki, and from that elegant French style of animation that borders to realism. The adventure is strange enough to make you fall back into escapism, but at the same time it's all very close to heart. Carl Fredricksen is as believable as Walter Matthau or Jack Lemmon were in Grumpy Old Men. Up seems to salute these kind of cranky old men too, it seems to give an homage to this soon extinct generation of analog, post- war dream weaving. It also seems to be wanting to tell the kids of today that you should really try and be nice to cranky old men, because being one is not the easiest thing in the world. Another thing the movie seems to be telling us is that no matter how lonely and bittersweet life can be when you're at the end of your days, we are all children at heart.","

"axlrhodes","15 July 2010","In the years since Toy Story burst onto our screens,i have grown a little weary of the cute digimations that have flooded our screens. More than most seemed to feature some sarcastic little animal,voiced by an irritating overpaid recognisable actor picking up and easy paycheck. So, with trepidation i inserted Up in to my DVD machine and after 10minutes i realised i was watching something as imaginative as it was visually impressive. I never gave a second thought to who was voicing who.To my delight, i just let myself be carried away with the film and at the end i found myself having choked back the tears at least 5 times. Wow. I never thought a digimation could do that to me but it did. My hardened heart has been thawed by the sheer joy and creation on display in Pixars Up. A truly remarkable film done with love and passion that deserves all the plaudits and all the stars in all the magazines and review shows around the world. Perfection.","

"michaelRokeefe","14 November 2009","A sure instant classic from Pixar. From the minds of Pete Docter and Bob Peterson comes a timely and endearing story of Carl Fredrickson (voiced by Ed Asner), a grumpy widower, who is a hold out in the middle of major construction. He is not about to sell the home he shared with his devoted wife for decades. Carl and Ellie met as children both with dreams of following their adventurer idol Charles Muntz(Christopher Plummer)to a land of the lost, Paradise Falls in South America.After being forced to go to an old folks home, 78 yr old Carl attaches thousands of balloons to the roof and heads his home due south to find Paradise Falls in South America. The trip is barely under way when the old geezer discovers he has a stowaway...8 year old Russell(Jordan Nagai), a chubby wilderness explorer trying to earn his final patch. Carl is as grouchy as Russell is full of joy and excitement.This animated feature is emotional, funny and a pure joy to watch and is meant for the whole family. I don't even recall any juvenile potty humor that is usually obligatory for such flicks. Loneliness is bittersweet and the adventure itself is uplifting and touching. Definitely a feel good movie.Other voices you may or may not recognize: John Ratzenberger, David Kaye, Elie Docter and writer/director Peterson voices Dug, the dog.","

"evanston_dad","10 December 2009","As they did in ""Wall-E,"" the Pixar team creates an opening twenty minutes or so of movie in ""Up"" that in itself is a small masterpiece of streamlined narrative film-making, and if it doesn't leave you reduced to a puddle of dribbly tears by the time it's over, you have a heart of stone. However, also as in ""Wall-E"" but even more so here, the first part of the movie is so skillfully crafted that it leaves the rest of it somewhat lacking.I feel like the Pixar filmmakers are trying too hard to satisfy two different audiences with the same movie. ""Up"" is about very adult issues -- dealing with the loss of a life partner, the obsolescence of old age -- crammed around a not-all-that-interesting adventure comedy story designed to delight the kiddies. ""Wall-E"" suffered from the same syndrome slightly; but the theme of environmental awareness in that film was universal enough, and integrated wholly enough into the action sequences, that the schizophrenia of it all was easy to overlook. In ""Up,"" I would have preferred to just continue the story that's set up in the opening moments without the kid movie tangent, and that's what ultimately made ""Up"" a much less memorable viewing experience for me than other recent Pixar films.I wonder how long it will be before Pixar forms a unit that makes animated films strictly for adults, as they seem to want to.Grade: A-","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","15 October 2023","After suffering the studio mandated crushing heartbreak Carl decides to embark on the adventure of a lifetime.This features great visual storytelling, which is of course necessary when you have a protagonist who feels a lot but is too closed off to say most of it a lot of the time. Solid comedy, especially physical, without feeling the need to humiliate senior citizens despite centering one. Same thing for overenthusiastic chatty Cub Scouts.It also delivers on excitement and tension, and is well-paced with not a single truly slow moment; it's not even tedious when watching characters be bored. I greatly appreciate the love of nature and animals, and criticism of aggressive city construction practices.I recommend this to everyone. 8/10.","

"Astralan","1 June 2009","The sneak peeks and trailers to this movie did not particularly inspire me to go to this movie. It looked like it was a rambling movie that didn't really speak to the comic or action side to the viewer. A guy puts enough balloons together to lift a house off it's foundation: So WHAT??? He inadvertently picks up a scout as he flies away: Again... so WHAT?? Getting the point of a movie is a big reason to motivate people to go SEE a movie I would think. But this was a Pixar film, and I NEVER miss a Pixar film. So, in a moment of spontaneous motivation (and seeing that 2 out of three spawn were currently in house that morning), I popped some corn, my wife filled some water bottles, and we all piled into the Tan Mini-van and went down to the Metropolitan theater (where I felt confident I would not be met with a sour presentation of this film) to purchase tickets and view this movie.The last time I went to see an ""3D"" film was an iMax theater with sharks and fish. It was pretty cool, so I was happy to kid about how much the glasses added to the family appeal. We sat down and waded through the kiddie previews and trailers then came an announcement to put our 3D glasses on. The new Toy Story and Ice Age (both up to their 3rd sequel) previews were run. Sorry, when you get to a third sequel that wasn't originally written as a trilogy I can't get excited. The Disney lead-on filled the screen and away we went.Within the first 10 minutes I was angrily batting moisture from my cheeks. I was shocked. Pixar emptied the climax of the plot first off, but what an opening sequence of events! Without giving too much away, the plot revolves around a core of love and a promise. Remember those ""Cross your heart"" promises? Well, there you have it. The rest is a strange adventure with some odd sub-plots that seem thrown in to keep the kiddies focused. Both colorful and deep, the only real question one keeps throughout the movie is whether the promise will be fulfilled or not.My wife and I watched through the ending credits (hoping for a surprise tag somewhere. Sadly, no) and saw Brad Birds name come up in the conceptualization of this film, and granted some of his influence if felt. The primary animators are quite diversified and well established, some even old enough to be your father or grandfather. As I IMDb'd some of the talent, I was impressed... and as for Ed Asner playing the primary role: I thought he had died years ago!!! But he's alive, and a great talent for the part. Pete Docter who has been in the Pixar pen since the first Toy Story does an admirable job of making this one and a half hour film both entertaining and thoughtful. There are chases, there are technological malfunctions, there are obsessions, there are fanatics and there are devouts and totally absurd sequences. This movie is no less a study of society than ornithology is a study of birds. Its amazing.And all through it you get to see how generations meet and interact on a very honest level. I am not young, but I am not old. Each generation will find something totally involving in this film. From an artists point of view the artwork and color are spot on; from a comedy point of view it is not overwhelming; from the heart... well, it's profound.The audience clapped after it was over. During the viewing, there was a nominal level of noise from the ""too young to even enjoy Dr Suess"" generation but it wasn't distracting. This film is for kids; Well, not just kids... for kids, adolescents, early adulthood, young parents, old parents, grandparents... its for everyone. Highly recommended. Well done, Pixar, well done.","

"Ryan_Barbakins","15 February 2020","This is my personal favorite pixar film. The music, dialogue, characters, comedy, and story have ingrained themselves into my brain forever as something to behold. This film succeeds every time to hit the right emotional buttons for me. This I believe is because of how greatly developed each element is.
A criticism I see thrown around is that the first 10 minutes are great, while the rest isn't. I strongly disagree, because this film isn't only about the first 10 minutes. It is about an old man getting the adventure of his lifetime, hoping to do it for his deceased wife, but eventually letting himself move on from it. The very end of the film when Carl lets his house float away saying ""it's just an old house"" perfectly encompasses this theme.
I can totally understand people not liking this movie as much as me, or preferring a different pixar film over this one (I love just about every pixar film) but subjectively, this film has had the greatest impact on my life, and I appreciate it to the moon and back.","

"paul2001sw-1","27 January 2013","'Up', the latest delightful animated film from Pixar, combines whimsicality, beautiful graphics and a lot of laughs. It follows in the spirit of previous Pixar movies, most obviously its immediate predecessor 'WALL-E', but has something of its own flavour too - although the medium is different, there are elements of this film that would not have been out of place in Nick Park's 'Wallace and Grommit' films. What really has impressed many people about Pixar's films, and which certainly impressed me about this one, is not just that they feature groundbreaking animation, but they are put together with a real auteur's eye: look for the quality of the scene composition, or the way that the final images of one scene fit visually and thematically with the starting images of the next, and it's clear that this is a film made by people who know how to make movies (although for once, John Lasseter himself is not directing, and the job is done instead by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson). And ask yourself, have many mainstream Hollywood blockbusters feature two (sympathetic) characters as unglamourous as a childless widower and a fat kid? This is a gentle movie, for sure; but also a genuinely funny one, and oddly, in spite of its fantastical story, a certain grounding in truth actually lacking in most live action Hollywood films.","

"lisafordeay","4 January 2016","Up is a Oscar winning animated film from Pixar that tells the story of an elderly man who whisks his house away by using balloons and goes to the falls where his deceased wife wanted to go. Along the journey he teams up with a scout named Russell,a dog named Dug and a peacock and together they go off on an adventure. The animation in this film is very well done and the first 10 minutes of this film is very sentimental where we see Carl(Ed Asher from Elf)who meets his future wife who was a real tomboy and we as the audience get to see them growing up to actually falling in love to actually growing old together. That was just genius the way the filmmakers did this. Also the story is very good too and if you haven't seen this movie I strongly recommend it. When I first seen this film first I actually despise it because it felt rather boring and just too overrated for my likings. But when I finally seen it again another few times I actually changed my mind on it and ended up liking the film.","

So, in order to avoid getting into a nursing home, he makes his house fly with the help of balloons, in order to get it to the place he always dreamed of living. I can't really find anything that could possibly have bothered me with Up, except some corny details and unreasonably confusing plot holes. But those things can easily be overlooked when the rest of the movie is worth watching. It is emotional, issuing with many touching and difficult subjects, such as loosing a loved one, parents divorce and others. And, in my opinion, the movie handles them beautifully, so that even a child could understand them and still have fun with the movie. And there for I give Up an 8 out of ten.","

"tabuno","20 January 2019","5 July 2009. ""Up"" attempts the difficult fusion of both children and adult elements in the same movie and usually succeeds marvelously at both. This sharp, 3-D animated movie handles both roarously funny scenes along with dramatic emotional scenes dealing with love, growing old, and the issue of what's important in life. However, as a serious movie, it attempts to incorporate childlike fantasy elements and sometimes the rigors of logical and reasonable cause and effect go out the window which would be no problem in a traditional animated movie directed towards young people. But ""Up"" in attempting to have it both, both serious grown-up issues and thoughtful scenes, it brings with it an expectation of a tighter reign on more realistic scenes regarding chases and escapes while thrilling go beyond plausibility, breaking the suspension of animated realism, which when 3-D is used actually increases the need for virtual practical sequences. Overall however, this movie is captivated with fabulous colors, the action is riveting, the plot outline decently strong and in some instances even more intimate than Coraline (2009). 8/10.","

Carl Fredricksen(Ed Asner) was a lonely little boy who worships an explorer named Charles Muntz, a man who was disgraced for faking the discovery of a big bird in Venezuela. He meets Ellie, a neighbor who shares his passion for nature. When they grow up they marry, but are unable to have children. He sells balloons and she works at a zoo. They have always intended to travel to South America to verify Muntz's claims to clear his name. The best laid plans of mice and men prevent it and Elle dies, leaving Carl alone. His house is surrounded by a new development, but he refuses to leave. He injures a construction worker in a dispute, and receives an eviction notice. He comes up with the idea to attach thousands of helium balloons to lift the house into the air and fly it to Venezuela and fulfill his dream of finding Muntz's bird. He takes off with a stowaway, Russell, who is trying to earn a merit badge by helping the elderly. They meet a non flying bird and a talking dog along the way. They make it to their destination and find Muntz living in a zeppelin. They end up in a fight over the bird and, not to worry, this is a children's story, so all's well that ends well.","

"neil-476","14 October 2009","Up finally arrives in the UK and, just when I thought Pixar couldn't do better than WALL-E, it turns out they can.It's not often that I find myself thinking that a film is pretty much perfect, but this is one of them. The core story of Carl's adventure in his balloon-powered house together with stowaway Russell is exciting, involving, moral, funny (very funny!), and visually stunning.The 3D is used wonderfully effectively, but without being so in-your-face that you are always having your nose rubbed in it.But I must put my name down as one of those who was stunned by the opening sequence running from the newsreel footage of Muntz' initial exploration through Carl and Ellie meeting and then the montage of their life together. This exquisite sequence wasn't just great animation, it was - in my view - one of the all time great cinematic sequences, on a par with any of the classic sequences since the birth of cinema. In 10 short minutes it not only provided the exposition, it also conveyed a huge amount of information which paid off later in the film, and did both of these without you ever feeling that you were being spoonfed. And I can't recall the last time something moved me so deeply in the cinema.This movie is, simply, a work of genius.","

"Floated2","25 August 2010","I finally got around to watching this film after last year it being released. Since its arrival, it had many great things said from critics about it; saying how it was so good and all. Many promos had tags such as ""funniest movie of the summer"" and ""best Pixar film. These both lines are outrageously wrong. Up is nowhere near funny, it is actually quite depressing. They simply showed the funny scenes in the trailer but the actual movie was not funny. Right from the beginning, we see the old man as a kid being forced by his future wife (as a kid) to like him, and eventually it starts from there. They eventually get married, live a happily nice life then a few short scenes of pictures with background music, they show the wife dying in a hospital then there, she is dead. That's not funny.The characters weren't great. The old man was grumpy, and cruel. The kid was fat (a little under obese), bratty and annoying. He had privacy problems which was well showed in the film. The villain was boring and far too aggressive for a kids movie. Also there were talking dogs and a large bird. There were so many things confusing and not right about the film, such as some scenes that showed blood, and a scene with dogs attacking them. Also a scene where the villain captures and ties the kid (Russell) on a chair trying to kill him by sending him down a ramp (though the old man eventually saves him). I seriously don't see why this film was so praised, it is completely misleading and not great. Bland storyline, and uninteresting plot. It is vastly overrated, and shouldn't be in the top 250.","

"solacewaves","7 September 2009","In terms of animated features, Pixar ventures where very few other animated films have gone before and that is to delve into the lives of the elderly generation. In fact, having any film (animated or not) examine what it is like to grow old and the roller coaster ride that is life would normally mean you are in for some heavy material indeed. This is because true depictions of life are not constantly joyful and grand, it is always hand in hand with tears and hardships. In this respect, Pixar are to be applauded to have dared create a ""kids"" film that explores the circle of life in all its vivid glory and personal heartache.Those who have scored UP poorly have undoubtedly felt misled, disappointed or even cheated because oftentimes when one thinks of Pixar, one thinks of imaginative explorations of what it would be like if our toys were alive (Toy Story 1 and 2), or if cars could talk (Cars), or if a mouse wanted to be a gourmet chef (Ratatouille), or how a family attempts to be ""normal"" when they all have superpowers (The Incredibles). Previous Pixar stories have always reached the realms of ""brilliant"" because these imaginative explorations are balanced with plot depth, humor and characters which audiences connect to and cheer for. Whether it's an ant trying to show his colony that they should stand up to the grasshoppers (A Bug's Life) or a humble cleaning robot guiding humanity home and trying to find love (Wall-E), all Pixar films are both fantastical and deeply meaningful thus showing their movies are more than just eye candy.And this is where UP has divided the people. Don't get me wrong, UP has the fantastical and the deeply meaningful in spades, the difference here is that Pixar explores these to the extreme.Flying a house to South America using thousands of balloons, dogs with futuristic collars that allow them to translate their ""dog"" language into English (or any other human language) and lest not forget they can also cook, a mythical rainbow colored bird and an old man who uses a walking stick in the first half of the film but can do ""Indiana Jones""-like feats in the second half of the film - Fantastical? CHECK.Boy meets girl, they fall in love, they marry, they discover they can't have children, they grow old together, wife dies, old man lives alone in house which he calls by his wife's name while high rise buildings are being constructed around him, old man attempts to fulfill promise to his deceased wife by flying to South America taking the house with him, and all that doesn't even cover the background story of the boy scout (who's father has left him and now only lives with his mum) who tries to help the old man out - Deeply meaningful? CHECK.The daring exploration by Pixar of both these fantastical and meaningful themes has resulted in a beautiful, at times humorous, oftentimes heart-wrenching and flawed (but not necessarily in a bad way) film.Never before has Pixar challenged the audience to such a level. Are you able to suspend belief to the point where you can believe a house can be lifted off by thousands of helium filled kids balloons and yet at the same time be willing to invest in an old man (who himself is flawed in more ways than one) and experience both the pain of love lost and the goal of hope found? Will parents be willing to explain to their young children about life and death? Will kids understand the adult themes? Will adults enjoy the ride or will they feel the movie is too depressing and the events too unbelievable? These are the questions which Pixar has dared audiences to confront.As for me, I enjoyed the film, I laughed during the bits where you're meant to laugh, and I was moved to tears during the bits where you were meant to be moved (especially the beginning which shows the fast forward life of old man Carl). I struggled at times with suspending my belief of the events in the second half; how both Carl and Russell (the boy scout) manage to do the physically astounding is not to be thought about in depth. All in all, a brave film by Pixar that doesn't quite reach the lofty heights of brilliance but if looked at from above has many lessons to be learned and perhaps, just perhaps examines the flaws in all of us (especially as we get older) and how we should all try to reach UP to greater heights.","

"Igenlode Wordsmith","3 November 2009","A lot of people have written about the humour, excitement, sweetness, depiction of love etc. etc. of this film, and with most of that I'd concur; I want to write about the element I haven't seen mentioned much, and which I perhaps enjoyed and was impressed by the most -- Pixar's homage to the spirit of the past, right down to the authentic style of the vocals in the 'period' song that plays at the end of the credits. (Not just a bit of distort and crackle to make it sound old -- if anything, that's overdone -- but the singing technique and orchestration are spot-on for a pre-war popular record. Wish I could say the same for the rhymes, but 'adventure' clearly isn't the easiest couplet to complete..!) By having Carl as the principal character and his adventures triggered by his childhood fantasies, Pixar have very cleverly contrived to have their cake and eat it: to produce what is basically a 'Boys' Own' adventure full of lost jungles, unknown species, biplanes and giant airships, mad scientific gadgets and a reclusive genius -- something out of the ""Eagle"" magazine, right down to its action climax -- and yet to set it in what is supposedly the modern world of its juvenile audience. The 1931 newsreel with which the film opens is wonderful pastiche (and was that a visual reference to ""King Kong"", as adventurer Muntz prepares to reveal his latest discovery?), the two children and their games bring the period to life as the real existence of people just like us without feeling in any way anachronistic, and then the segment that follows demonstrates Pixar's effective use and command of an even earlier idiom -- the fluent story-telling of the *silent* film era.Too much has been written already on the impact and poignancy of this wordless love-story for me to be able to add anything to its praise. I would agree with the reviewer who wrote that it is very rare for films of any kind to depict the married love of adults, let alone to do it in animation so sweetly as this.But actually, the moment when tears came to my eyes was not during this segment at all, but the moment when the house takes off and Carl makes his defiant adventure/escape... (Shades of the Crimson Permanent Assurance!)I found most of this film very enjoyable indeed, especially the retro adventure feel and the dog psychology. What actually undermined it for me was not the surrogate-family-bonding scenario, which would normally have been anathema to me but is handled convincingly here, but the handling of the villain. Interestingly, reading comments on the IMDb boards suggests not only that I am not alone in this, but that the film's creators themselves weren't very sure right up to a late stage in production what to do with him -- the result is that the character, who could have been intriguing, is simply dropped into one-dimensional mode and wasted.I would have preferred a treatment more like the ending of ""Ratatouille"" (and would have preferred a beginning to ""Ratatouille"" more like this!; and for this idiosyncratic reason alone, which did significantly affect my enjoyment, I have rated it down one mark from the level of 9 (for ""deeply moving and exciting"") that it would otherwise have scored on my personal scale. Both films still score by my standards very highly.","

"Amyth47","27 October 2018","My Rating : 9/10A wonderfully-done animated film, as most Pixar films are. Edward Asner provides the voice behind Carl, a widowed elderly man who is being forced to leave his home for a retirement home. Instead of accepting his fate he floats his home away to try and get to Paradise Falls: a destination he wanted to go to with his wife. The montage of Carl and Ellie's relationship is both lovely and sad. Their relationship goes through many ups and downs, yet their love remains strong, even after Ellie's death Carl is dedicated to her. The brilliant script and animation are as always with Pixar films backed by an impeccable score. One of the best animated films of all time and more than worthy of joining Beauty and the Beast and Toy Story 3 as the only animated films to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Two thumbs UP!","

"moviewizguy","12 June 2009","Carl and Ellie meet and discover they both have the same dream of becoming explorers. They see newsreels of a daring adventurer named Charles Muntz, who is accused of faking a discovery of an animal unknown to man. He goes back to Venezuela, vowing to bring back the creature he claims he saw. Nothing is heard from him in years. Carl and Ellie grow up and marry. They buy an old house and fix it up. The two save up their money to go to Paradise Falls, but end up using the money for problems in life. It's present day and Ellie has died.This is all told in a beautiful but heart-wrenching montage that will make any human tear up. It's one of the best montage I've ever seen. However, the film focuses of Carl after the death of his wife. He is a recluse. After a problem has occurred, Carl decides to go to Venezuela, as a promise to Ellie. However, he's stuck with an 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer named Russell. Together, they embark in an adventure to a lost world, all brought to you by Pixar.Saying that ""Up"" is (yet) another masterpiece from Pixar is getting clichéd by now. At this point, Pixar can do no wrong. What they have done in the past several years was bringing films for all ages to enjoy. ""Up"" is the reason why people go see movies in the first place. Compared to other animated films, ""Up"" doesn't have innuendos for the older audiences. That's because it doesn't need to. This film is fantastic for all ages, the story appealing to many more people than the last two Pixar films.The rich story in ""Up"" may might as well be the most realistic from Pixar yet. It's poignantly told and there are things in life that are shown here that have never been shown in other animated films before. The characters are lovable and charming and are painfully and surprisingly authentic (well, except for the talking dogs, of course). The odd relationship between Carl and Russell grows as the film progresses. For the first time, the adult is smarter than the child. The film is also undeniably endearing. The film is so endearing, in fact, that you'll cry or choke up in at least three or four different spots in the film.I didn't see this film in 3D but I can tell you the film works well with or without the extra dimension aspect. The whole look of the film is just wonderful. The colors are exuberant and lively. The animation is pitch perfect. The story is nearly flawless, with some minor problems, including some talking dogs. The score by Michael Giacchino is sweet and lovely. The directing by both Pete Docter and Bob Peterson is really great. Wow, it seemed like every shot of the film moved the story along. Some scenes were hilarious too, filled with witty dialogue. The action sequences were impeccably crafted, I'll admit, including an excellent shot in the very first one.Overall, what I loved best about this movie are the characters and the story, the two most important aspects to any movie, in fact. The entire film just hits all of the right notes. With films being released these days, it's fantastic to see movies like ""Up"" are being released every once in awhile. I loved every minute of ""Up"" and I assure you will too. It's no surprise for me to say that ""Up"" is the best film of this year but I find it hard another film may be better than it.","

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10 November 2010","Wow, I mean wow. I saw this at the movies at an advanced screening and OH MY GOOOOOODDDD!!!!!!!! Since the 80s PIXAR's gone from tiny to the greatest animation studio of all time along with Disney and Studio Ghibli.I cried for the first time in the cinema. This movie had the charm of old school Disney movies. It's also no surprise that this was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. The characters were 100% likable and the movie was different like Hayao Miyazaki's films.Who would give this film a one-star rating?! Only people with no taste and Epic Movie lovers would hate this because those kind of guys are morons. Bottomline: A 10/10 movie with absolutely no flaws. It plays like a masterpiece which it definitely is. Highly recommended for animation lovers, PIXAR lovers and even for those who love Hayao Miyazaki's films.It's just...gorgeous!:D","

"ygwerin1","12 January 2021","Just watching this film on the box some while after it was originally screened, I had heard of it but not even seen as much as a trailer.I thoroughly enjoyed it and would heartily recommend it to everybody to watch.Enjoy and take off with Charles and Russell on their rollicking adventures.Seeing Charles Fredricksen on the movie's posters and possibly, on the trailer one may mistake him for a crusty old fart.Had I seen this film when I was much younger, I may well have made that mistake n error of judgement.But seeing it now at my advanced years of 72, I get a different perspective on it altogether.I may not be Charles age yet, but I am nearer to it than I am to Russell's.This has to be seen from the start the opening portion is essential, to be able to fully appreciate exactly who Charles Fredricksen is.We can then see his tale with his entire rationale the life he has with his soul mate Ellie, from their childhood friendship to old age.Anyone who has travelled that road can appreciate his life and loss, when she has finally gone from his world leaving only an existence.He may well have settled like so many others like him for a 'Retirement Village' but what a misnomer that phrase actually is.They are really nothing of the kind but actually one step away, from an old foggies mausoleum.Representing what so often occurs when you cross that portal, a gradual process of ossification.Charles Fredricksen is saved from that fate worst than death by nothing short of serendipity, but is it by the narrowest of margins.Who at any age especially at mine wouldn't wish to simply cast off the moorings, of your earthbound existence and float off to pastures new?","

"Movie-ManDan","29 June 2019","'Up' has become only the second animated film in history to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It did not win, but was the nomination worth it? It sure was.One thing I have always loved about the Disney production is that the movies they make show a tremendous amount of humanity. That is the essence of this. I absolutely adored the love story between Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) and his wife, Ellie. It opens up with them as children that aspire to explore the world, much like their hero, Charles F. Muntz (Christopher Plummer). They plan on one day travelling to the mystical Paradise Falls in South America--a promise Carl keeps. It then leads to a four minute montage of Carl and Ellie's lives together. At four minutes and silent, it certainly seems like a life well-lived. It goes through everything from them as children to the time of Ellie's death. Along with its lovely score by Michael Giacchino, this silent montage of life with Ellie is sure to make the viewer weep. We feel the effects of this scene long after it ends. Afterwards, faced with being forced to an old-age home, Carl decides to tie thousands of balloons to his house and float to Paradise Falls like he and his wife had always dreamed about. The house symbolizes Ellie helping her husband reach his destination. It is almost like her spirit inhabits the house. And with the thousands of balloons helping the house float, it is such a sight to behold. True beauty.Carl meets a child named Russell who wants to help Carl to earn a badge in assisting the elderly, much like an angel getting his wings. When the house floats, it takes Russell along for the ride. They wind up a distance from Paradise Falls, but must walk the house to their destination. Now here is where the movie gets silly: Russell wants to keep a unique kind of bird he calls Kevin, and they encounter a group of dogs with animal language converters that allow humans to hear the dogs speak English. They just annoy Carl to no end. Turns out Muntz, who is surprisingly still alive, has made new dog tools and has been seeking bird like Kevin for years. These action scenes with he dogs and Muntz run on much longer than needed. I gather that was just for the children. Luckily, none of it diminishes what we have come to love.Carl is a multilayered character that is easy to sympathize with. As a child, he was timid but still wanted to explore. After the death of wife, became more grumpy as his dreams of adventure dies. When his house floats, his yearning for adventure resume from where it was years ago. Carl is torn between his new responsibilities to Russell and wanting to fulfil his dream. He wonders what is more important: a house, or people? The arrival of Russell may make things harder, but the kid is someone Carl grows to love like the grandson he never had. And the bird, the dogs, and Russell may be the perfect ingredients for Carl to have the adventure of a lifetime.This thrilling, beautiful and hilarious adventure film it one the whole family can savour. Reasons for loving this may differ with the age groups, but nobody can deny the greatness that 'Up' possesses.4/4","

"ctomvelu1","29 November 2009","Pixar's UP is about a widower who decides to fly his house to a falls in Venezuela in memory of his late wife. To do this, he ties helium-filled balloons to the house, and off he goes. Joining him on his crazy adventure is a neighborhood kid, and along the way they pick up a talking dog and a rare jungle bird being hunted by a crazed explorer who gets around in a dirigible. This is some nutty plot, but it works. The animation is superb, the story line quite touching. Ed Asner plays the widower and Chris Plummer is the bad guy. Highly recommended, mainly for kids and their moms. I suspect most dads mayl have a tough time sitting through this whimsical flick.","

"bob the moo","17 January 2010","I keep waiting for Pixar to let me down by delivering a good film that only disappoints by virtue of it not quite being up to the high standards set by previous films and, while Up is not quite as strong in some regards as some of their previous films, it is definitely a very good film that sits easily amongst their impressive catalogue. Up opens with a montage that spans about 70 years but yet succeeds in making you understand the main character and also feel for him and it makes it look like it was the easiest thing in the world to do. Without any pat sentimentality or exploitative tricks or cues, the film is quite moving from the very start and it means that the viewer is right there from the very start.It doesn't quite keep this up though because, although it does still have an emotional heart (thanks to the good work in the opening 10 minutes), the film is much more about the adventure. This does work really well even if it does all get a little bit silly as it goes along and adds talking dogs on top of flying houses etc, however the key thing is that you go with it , mainly because of how well it hooks you into the scenario from the very start. It also helps that on top of being exciting and engaging, it is also very funny indeed. Full of amusing aspects as well as specific funny jokes, the film doesn't separate some jokes for the kids and some for the adults but rather has good clean material with strong timing and delivery that makes it easily appreciable by the largest range of ages. The talking dog was my personal favourite but generally every character moved things along in regards action, drama and comedy.Needless to say the animation is brilliant. I did not see this in 3D but it is still gorgeous to behold, with the small personal effects being just as well done as the broad sweep of the fantasy scenario. The animation of the characters is great because it manages to convey such information in the tiny reactions or gestures of the characters – hard to imagine how one would do that in terms of capturing this performance detail not to mention the technical aspects. Asner does great voice work in the lead role, while Nagai does well to avoid being no more than an irritating ""cute kid"" but is actually a good presence. Peterson's timing as Doug is great while Plummer is suitably threatening and of course Ratzenberger gets a slot as normal.Up is a great film, probably my favourite of the year by some distance. The film hits the heart early with an impacting opening 15 minutes that sucks the viewer in and makes it look easy at the same time, then follows up with a solid slice of family-friendly adventure that is as thrilling as it is funny. Another in a succession of incredibly good films from Pixar.","

"KUAlum26","2 July 2009","Widower Carl Fredrickson(voice of Ed Asner)feels like his time left could best be spent fulfilling the dream that he and his wife shared:namely,to fly off and explore the wilds of South America. A balloon salesman for a good part of his adult life,he decides to use his inventory to lift and carry away the old home that he shared with her for the forty some years they were together. And why not? The house is surrounded by a massive re-urbanizing development and there's considerable pressure on him to sell his beloved home. Rather than do that,he's set on taking his dreams in tact with him to do the things that he lived a lifetime putting off.The plans seem great. One hitch:a chubby,overly chatty World Explorer Scout named Russell,who is doggedly intent on helping Carl to finish his badge accumulation.The rest of the story is the main motor of this latest offering by the revolutionary studio. A struggle to navigate to the mythic falls point of the region(they miss the target,landing on the far other side of the plateau),as they are joined by a mythic wild bird and a voice-collar speaking hunting dog,defending against the hunting wishes of a lost explorer(voice of Christopher Plummer),whose singular vision to chase HIS aspirations have turned him into something g far less noble than he once was or appeared.This is a nice,sometimes inspired,sometimes funny,somewhat maudlin story that has nothing really wrong with it(save a suspension of disbelief over,among other things,the physics of a balloon-carried old-style home being carried,in tact,over thousands of miles). Director Pete Docter and co-writer,co-director Bob Petersen(who voices many of the dogs in the story,particularly Dug,the afore-mentioned dog that greets the intrepid travelers initially)supply a perfectly smart,engaging and entertaining film. I,personally,couldn't quite warm up to it as wholly as past PIXAR adventures(Toy Story,Buig's Life,Finding Nemo and WALL-E come to mind),but I still found this easily very entertaining and reasonably endearing(the dogs with talking collars particularly tickled me). Some rather depressing,adult themes and a longer-than-expected opening might test the patience of some,but this film largely is able to,like its title,stay buoyant throughout.","

"areatw","25 May 2016","This is probably my favourite Pixar movie to date. I loved 'Ratatouille' and 'The Incredibles' but 'Up' is in another league - quite simply outstanding. It's an emotional roller-coaster of a film, which is a remarkable achievement in itself for an animated feature, but Pixar rarely fails to deliver.The story is wonderfully uplifting and the characters are engaging. It is very well written and of course the production is terrific like with all Pixar movies. 'Up' is also surprisingly funny - usually the humour in animated films isn't my thing but this one did make me laugh. It is also visually stunning and I would love to see it again in 3D one day.This is as close to perfection as an animated movie has come and it can be appreciated and enjoyed by all. 'Up' is a masterpiece.","

"one9eighty","11 September 2020","""Up"" is a Pixar movie, directed by Pete Doctor and Bob Peterson, which they both wrote with Tom McCarthy too. It has a run time of 96 minutes and was released in the UK in 2009 with a U rating. Featuring the voices of Edward Asner, Christopher Plummer, and Jordan Nagai this is an absolutely charming movie that is suitable for both a younger audience looking for fun, and a more sentimental older audience that still has a sense of adventure too.Bespectacled Carl Fredricksen idolizes the famous explorer and adventurer Charles Muntz. He learns that Muntz was discredited after it was proved that he faked the skeleton of his recent find, but this does not dampen young Carl's spirits too much as one day he'd like to follow in his hero's footsteps. Muntz was last seen boarding his blimp to go in search of the real bird to salvage his reputation and career. Carl bumps into Ellie, a young girl who shares his passion for Muntz and they soon make a promise to one day follow in his footsteps and head out to Paradise Falls in South America. Carl and Ellie fall in love, they get married, they get jobs as Balloons salesman and a zookeeper respectively, and they grow old together blissfully albeit with some hiccups along the way. Realising that they have not fulfilled their ambition of moving to Paradise Falls Carl buys tickets and plans to surprise Ellie with them. Unfortunately, Ellie's declining health puts her in hospital and she eventually passes away, leaving Carl heartbroken and alone. Carl shuts himself away from the world and becomes a sour recluse - as an example, one day a boy scout called Russell comes calling, suggesting that he helps Carl out around the house so he can work towards his 'help the elderly' badge, but Carl tricks him with some silly task to get rid of him. The city which grew around Carl wants his house gone and eventually a court order wants to force him into a retirement home. Before he can be bundled away though the crafty old ex-Balloon puts a plan into motion which allows him to escape with his house - he uses as many balloons as he can get and floats the house away. Unfortunately, though, Carl is not alone, an accidental stowaway is with him - Russell, who was under the porch. They end up in South America where they meet a bird which Russell calls Kevin, they meet a talking dog called Dug, and they also meet Muntz. All of which, the bird, the dog, and Muntz are linked. If the adventure was not started when the house floated away, then it's definitely a-foot with Muntz back in the game.This film is beautifully created, the animation and colour palette is vibrant and gorgeous. The attention to, and presentation of detail is absolutely first class. The imaginative story is a fun adventure combining fantasy, comedy, suspense, and emotions. While it is fun for children to watch the floating house and the talking dog, this film is multi-layered too, and definitely one for adults too. I am not ashamed to admit it, but this film is an absolute tear-jerker at the beginning. I must be getting soft in my middle age, and perhaps too many horror films have broken me, but this film genuinely made me shed a tear. The voice acting in this is brilliant and really helps to compliment and bring to life the beautifully stunning imagery. In Carl, Edward Asner presents a grumpy but sweet and sincere old character who feels familiar to me. Jordan Nagai as the voice of Russell is enthusiastic and passionate and really drives life into old Carl again.Unless you don't have a heart of stone expect a roller coaster of emotions; you will laugh, you will cry, and by the end of the movie you will have experienced one of the best Pixar movies in my opinion. As well as being a box-office hit which easily recouped its budget (and then some!) this film has become a bit of a cult movie due to its heart breaking and then heart-warming ability. I am glad I got to watch this film and it has cemented a place in my movie collection for its content and its beauty. I am happy to recommend this to people of all ages, and I am happy to give this a solid 8 out of 10.","

"songhengjimmyjs","18 November 2015","Up is wonderful and well written story that is very well animated for its time. It stands out from other movies not only due to its animation technology but through the uses of character archetypes. Along some ingenious planning throughout the movie which will certainly grip you on your seat for the whole time. Each part of the story fits together seamlessly and as directed by Pete Docter who has shown potential in the past with Monster.Inc. It is no surprise that Up would not have been better. Easter Eggs are bound to be found as this is just another part of the Pixar and Disney family. It ended very gracefully with a happy ending for the two main and primary characters that lies within the movie. I am very glad that I had spent my time and money to watch this exquisite animation. It is well made and deserves to be recommended if you are seeking the adventure that lies beyond the unreachable.","

"jar-06630","2 July 2023","Up is an example of how to convey themes that children might not understand in a way that they CAN understand. Up is definitely known for the first 15 minutes, and I consider this as some of the best writing for an animated movie. When you're a kid, you don't know what's happening sometimes, but as you get older, you know that Carl has experienced a miscarriage and his wife dying, and he doesn't know how to handle it, hence why he gets really tense about moving to the retirement home and wanting to fulfil Ellie's dream of going to Paradise Falls. Up manages to combine humour, sad themes and adventure into one movie, and it is, in my opinion, the best Pixar movie of all time and definitely deserved that Best Picture Oscar nomination.","

I also teared up from an emotional, tender scene with Carl and Ellie.The animation breathtaking, extremely funny and quirky too. It didn't pander to children i.e a kiddy movie, but made sure it entertained 'kids' of all ages.I actually wondered if the writers of this movie got together one night for pizza and beers and penned out this movie whilst a little intoxicated.

"jaredmobarak","4 June 2009","Over the years, the studio has gone from heartfelt children's fare to more heady dramas—still with a youthful touch, but deeper and more resonate than your standard ""stick the kid in front of the screen and have quiet for a couple hours"". It began with Ratatouille, a tale so layered that you couldn't remember how vague and almost unappealing the trailer looked, followed by Wall-E, with its power of visuals and emotions overcoming the need for dialogue to tell a heartfelt love story. And now, in 2009, Disney/Pixar brings us one of their best yet with Up. The trailer and studio pedigree may have gotten me in the seat, but the story, barely touched upon in the teaser, is what kept me enraptured and wanting more.Going in, I was truly unaware of what was in store. My minimal knowledge from the advertisements was that it would tell the story of an elderly, crotchety old gentleman named Carl Fredricksen and his adventures traveling the world in his house, elevated and transformed into a blimp by hundreds of helium-filled balloons. Oh, and about him warming up to the young Wilderness Scout Russell who finds himself on Carl's porch at the time of liftoff. However, right from the get-go, we see how much more Up is going to be. We are first introduced to a youngster in a movie theatre, watching newsreel footage of his hero Charles Muntz and the adventures he took to South America's Paradise Falls. This young boy pretends to be his idol and stumbles upon a kindred soul in Ellie, a little girl dreaming of adventure as well. Through a lovely montage, we watch as these two grow up and become Carl and Ellie: a couple in love, heart and soul.What I love about Pixar is its ability to throw easy out the window and put the hardships and rough times of life on screen. Life is dirty and full of tragedy, but without those difficulties, the wondrous moments wouldn't be so worthwhile and memorable. Carl spies the money jar, he and his wife now very late in age, and decides to finally get two tickets to Venezuela and live their dream of traveling to South America. As happens, though, the moment he was going to surprise Ellie is the moment where she breaks down, needing to be hospitalized, soon passing on to the next world. Carl, without his better half, becomes a shut-in, wanting to be left alone in the house—the last piece of Ellie that he has. But, when an incident occurs, leading to his arrest and subsequent ruling to move to a nursing home, Frederickson decides to bring the house itself to Paradise Falls and once and for all do the thing he's wanted to for over half a century. And all this happens in just the first 30 minutes or so. There is no one that does cartoon exposition better than Pixar, their stories so intricate and endearing, every character—whether human, animal, or inanimate object come to life—becomes a fully realized creature.When the actual adventure portion of the tale begins, you are already fully engrossed in the journey, feeling for Carl and his loss and subsequent need to flee. As any old person trying to be left alone does, he becomes short and unfriendly with young Russell once the boy is let inside the ""ship"", and with future acquaintances such as Dug the dog and Kevin the bird, he attempts to be uncompassionate to and unwanting of them. Events in his past will show why he feels this way, but the love we see that he had for his wife and fervor for life previously tell us that he will soon warm up to those around him as Up is not only a journey of adventure, but also of rediscovering one's reason for living. Carl's passion and need to get out and travel is reinvigorated once he acquires someone else to give his heart to.Besides the wonderful story, Pixar once more shows how their studio is at the cutting edge of computer animation. They do not attempt to render realistic humans because they aren't trying to mimic live-action. Instead, they keep to a stylistic choice throughout, keeping a unique creativity while still holding a place in the real world. The filters used and authenticity to old photographs and scraps of newspaper in the Fredricksen's ""book of adventures"" is astonishing in its believability. I loved the aesthetic of Paradise Falls, including Kevin and his almost dinosaur-like bone structure, but completely bird exterior. Even the voice acting is inspired in its choices and successful across the board. Bringing in Ed Asner to handle Carl was a perfect marriage, giving the role a hard-edged growl, yet still allowing the softhearted soul to show when necessary. And young Jordan Nagai, playing Russell, is by far the best part of the film. His childlike naivety is believable and his speech pattern and boyish mannerisms allow the character to leap off the screen.Disney's partnership with Pixar definitely kept alive one of the best film studios around. Whether Pixar would have survived to tell the stories it has on its own is a question we won't need to find an answer to. No one else would think to include dogs with collars that allow him or her to talk, let alone have it done in such a disjointed and easily distracted way. The constant train of thought changes when a squirrel or ball come into their view is priceless and the unorganized speech, calling to mind Yoda, really hits home as being exactly how I would have thought dogs would think. The filmmakers got every detail right and show once more why their studio is at the top of cinematic animation and very well could be at the top of cinema as a whole.","

"ken1848","8 August 2009","Up is a funny adventure with very well rendered and well animated 3D images. It delivers a message that we, irrespective of age, should never forget about dreams and are able to lead meaningful lives. It also sheds some light on the importance of letting go.However, some ideas are underdeveloped and puzzling. First, the relationship between the old man Carl and the kid Russell is not well-developed enough. Judging from Carl's indifference to Russell's visit, I do not feel his desire to have children after Ellie's death. Simultaneously, Russell's admiration for Carl as his role model can be further developed so that their very good relationship in the last two scenes can be better prepared. For example, what skills has Russell learned from Carl who used to be an adventurer? After watching the film, some may find the ten-minute Carl-and-Ellie love story much more touching and memorable than the Carl-and-Russell adventure. Second, Carl, who relies on an electric chair to move downstairs and staggers along with a stick, suddenly becomes so strong that he can even climb the ladder with his feet hanging in the air, which does not make any sense even in the created world. Third, it is too easy for them to ""float"" to Paradise Falls, a mysterious place, without scenes showing Carl's prior knowledge on aviation or science, which not only makes the plot contrived, but also the first-15-mintue adventure less exciting. Fourth, why and how does the bad guy invent a device helping his dogs talk with different languages? Fifth, the bad guy should be much older than Carl and I wonder why he is still alive and looks even younger than Carl. Sixth, why does the dog, a loyal animal, betray the explorer, even when he has the upper hand?On the whole, Up is interesting, visually stunning and suitable for kids to watch. However, the story and characters can be further developed. Wall-E, with robots who cannot speak, is more touching, while Bolt, a Disney animation, is funnier than this one with hundreds of dogs. Until now, my favorite Pixar film is still Finding Nemo. Toy Story 2 and Wall-E rank the second and the third respectively. The rest of my top five are The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Up, despite using two ordinary human beings as the main characters, lets me DOWN.","

"Marc_Israel_365","7 June 2014","Our colorful adventure is a combination of Virginia Lee Burtons' famous childhood book, ""The Little House"", where the house is a character and introduced as such immediately. Another part is a crass take on the Karate Kid without the wisdom. A loner kid of divorce is taken in by a senior citizen who blah, blah, blah (they fix/complete each other). Yet another part is the children's typical movie where kids stop the poachers and sing ""Kumbayah"". And we start off fast. In less than 12 minutes our idealistic and naive 8 year old boy meets his future wife, we watch their generational dreams go through life's twists and turns, and we're left with a grumpy 78 year old man who is a cab ride from being placed in a retirement home. Brutal. Kids have a hard time with this drama. ""Nowhere To Go But Up"" may have been a more meaningful title.Then comes the boy and then the adventure. The story is a modern family testament, where who ever can fill a family role is considered family. The void itself is predicated as victim hood which being connected to others helps fill. I like the drama, despite its obvious course,. I like the adventure despite its obvious course. I like the visuals despite.From victim to hero to a video store near you. A solid family film but written by a leftist corporation for the next generation of American Consumers.","

"Chris Knipp","3 June 2009","'Up's' plot-line plays with the Pixar films' cross-generational appeal by having an oldster and a kid as its main characters. It's a buddy picture about the voyage of Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), a 78-year-old widower, and Russell (Jordan Ngai), a chubby eight-year-old Asian ""Wilderness Explorer"" who wants to earn an ""assisting the elderly"" badge. The movie ""teaches"" us that we can still realize our life-long deferred dream of exploring South American wilderness if we can just attach thousands of helium balloons to our house and sail away. It's hard to say if up to then Frederickson's life has been fulfillment or disappointment. His wife Ellie (Elie Docter) was a childhood playmate who dreamed of emulating an explorer named Muntz (Christopher Plummer), who has found a prehistoric bird in South America's Paradise Falls plateau. They never go very far. Ellie, alas, can't have children. One day when they're both in their senior years she falls down and shortly thereafter dies. Fredrickson has had a career as a balloon salesman.The film sketches in the couple's life as sweetness and smiles, yet hints at a world of disappointment symbolized by Ellie's ""adventure"" scrapbook, which was never filled. Poor old Fredericksen won't move to a retirement home even though his little house is now surrounded by a vast loud construction zone. The demeaning practicalities of aging are depicted as something to escape from -- magically. When Fredericksen strikes an agent of the contractors and gets branded as a public menace he's somehow legally mandated to the old folks' home: this is the moment when he flies away, taking his house with him, with Russell a stowaway.There's no doubt about the exhilaration of an aerial escape, or the charm of the bond that develops between the old man and his dutiful, plucky little sidekick. But Up gets into deep trouble wit the arrival of the dogs, dozens of them, with electronic flashing collars that enable them to talk in squeaky (or sometimes deep) voices, in various languages according to what button you push. Forgive me, but I didn't buy it, and I just didn't see the need. Mr. Fredericksen is sold to us initially as a pretty feeble old man and so the strength and vigor he develops in South America is hard to accept. There's something to be said for a story that ends with the awarding of an explorer scout patch for assisting the elderly. All Russell really wanted to do was help the old man across the street, -- or even just across his lawn.I want to love Pixar films. Their animated features have moved from strength to strength. 'The Incredibles' was energetic and smart, 'Ratatouille' was witty and sophisticated, and 'WALL·E' wastranscendent and moving. Alas, Up does not live up to that standard.The house of Pixar has been declared triumphant in the field. Denby of The New Yorker heralds Pixar animations as examples of ""moral fable"" and damns the old Disney ones as mere ""psychological fables"" marked by ""cloyingness"" and ""malevolent overtones."" Well, Up is full of cloyingness and weirdness, and the latter part of its adventure has its fair share of malevolence. Up is a hugely overblown fantasy whose point is lost in endless violations of the laws of biology and physics. Pixar has its ups and downs, features different writers and directors, and to typecast them is dubious. What they have in common is a technology and a look. The look is mainstream, as is the sensibility. If you want something more artistically or intellectually adventurous, you'll go to French animations like 'Persepolis' or 'Fantastic Planet' or F'ear(s) of the Dark;' 'The Triplets of Bellville' blows away the similarly dark American film 'Coraline.' Eastern European animations have a fresher look. The world of Japanese anime is rich, fantastic, and frequently very adult or sexual; it seems to capture the original, fantasmagoric world of comic books better than American comic-based films like the Batman franchise. Likewise graphic novel films like 'Frank Miller's Sin City' go far beyond the tame confines of Pixar or Disney. An adult animation like 'Waltz with Bashir' is in another league.It's a bad start for 'Up' and not a step in the direction of technical or artistic innovation if you're forced, as you may be, to watch 'Up' in 3-D. The glasses, on top of your own, weigh upon and pinch your nose and the dimmed images with the planar levels they create are as flat and fake-looking as your grandmother's stereopticon slides. This Fifties movie gimmick with its chintzy throwaway plastic specs is unconvincingly heralded as the great new technology. It didn't do much for the creepy 'Coraline,' the fascistic 'U2/3D,' still less for the slipshod 'Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience,' and it only detracted from Zemeckis' watchable 'Beowulf.' 3-D is supposed to look incredibly real, but even granting this dubious claim, why use it for 'Up,' which flaunts its unreality? Its digital figures are like painted toys. Its Paradise Falls looks unabashedly like paper-mâché rocks and fake foam. The Pixar images pop out at you without the effect of 3-D imaging, the colors are brighter, and the experience is more absorbing. Why not let us use our own imaginations? There's some thrill of adventure in this movie, and certainly the titillation of swooping flights and dives through space, as well as the time-honored animation scare of teetering on a precipice, and going into free fall only to be magically saved. But this, compared to the best Pixar films, gets lost in its gimmicks at the cost of a meaningful tale. Of course a travel yarn is just one thing after another anyway, and there's' no harm in an adventure with the moral of a good deed attacked to it. But that's just what it is, though: attached. And how much richer were the worlds of 'WALL·E,' 'Ratatouille,' and 'The Incredibles'! 'Up' has less to offer to adults than they did.","

"zeekwunlau","11 April 2020","Because of the entanglement of love, they put aside the adventure of traveling around the world. The stream of water is old and old, and the life of each other has been completed, and it can withstand any dream miss. Because of the stumbling block of memories, even if she died as a photo on the wall, even if he had changed from a young boy to a stubborn old man, he would have to take a once-used common hut and set sail for their childhood aspirations. The hut is the carrier of cherished memories, and the shackles of the closed heart. The adventure is a dream to get what you want. It is also a rebirth to reminisce the past. Because of a journey that has not been lost, this old man who has fallen into solitary life because of his love and death has experienced a new partner. The occasion, found a new fulcrum and new sustenance.
The first ten minutes of the film described Carl's most of his life and Allie's life. I think many people's lives are similar to the first part of the film. When we were young and ignorant, we all cherished dreams of ignorance. Slowly, we are slowly worn away by life's expectations and dreams.As Wang Xiaobo said, life is a slow process of being hammered, and finally it becomes like a hammered cow.Their love is always with them, no matter what happens, the two are snuggling and accompany each other.Ordinary life, but they live unswervingly, this is the simplest appearance of love. In fact, in addition to love, there are friendship, affection and nature's love. These are the seven emotions and six desires that run through a person's life. We all have to face, Carl handed over the answers to his life questionnaire about love.Yes, Carl has become an old man, but with his love and dreams, his heart is full of blood, he was still the dream chasing boy. I think, as long as people remember their original dreams, it's never too late to start. May we run away for half our lives and return to our youth.Regarding adventures and dreams, an old man talks about the story of a young maniac, and the dream youth and memories of an adult. The ten-minute short film and the adventures and love of Carl and Ellie throughout the film are enough to become classics, making the main line of the film seem bland. Life is an adventure, the end of this journey is not a great spectacle, but walking with you","

"refresh_daemon","2 August 2009","One day, Pixar might make a film that will just fail to be decent. Fortunately, Up is not that picture. While the story is a little fragmented, this still remains a marvel of animated storytelling that continues the Pixar legacy of releasing solid 3D animated films.The story begins with Carl as a child and we quickly watch his relationship with Ellie, through its various phases, through its untimely end. And then we pick up again as Carl decides to make his late wife's dreams come true. He launches his house into the sky via a ton of balloons, but manages to pick up a young Wilderness Explorer named Russell and then his goal gets derailed from there. Along the way, we meet a few other kooky characters, hilarity ensues and we end on a nice note. First of all, I think Up contains some of the most mature themes and story elements of all of their films so far, especially as we watch Carl and Ellie's life together in fast forward. I don't know how much children will fully comprehend what was going on, but despite the brevity, I still found some of the moments to be borderline tearjerkers. One downside to the story is that it's essentially fragmented and requires that ""life with Ellie"" at the beginning, but overall, the ""quest averted"" concept works very well to help bring out Carl's character. Russell does cross into the land of affably annoying and at times it's difficult to retain sympathy for him due to all the trouble he causes, despite his innocence.The art is pretty classic Pixar, clean with lots of attention to detail and the animators definitely display their considerable skill in getting the characters to display various degrees of emotions. Voice actors do a great job with their characters, even the rather simple characters. Music is used well, even if it's not hyper-memorable.Ultimately, Up falls into line as a good Pixar film, just under the tier of great Pixar film. Of course, a good Pixar film tends to mean a great film otherwise and I won't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. 8/10.","

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","3 June 2009","After tackling rats with chef skills and voiceless robots on journeys of self-discovery, leave it to Pixar to make the star of its latest film an elderly man and continue to defy Hollywood's long-held belief that animated films have to zero in on children and concepts that can be marketed into hats and toys and backpacks. Heck, in ""Up"" even animals talking are explained rather than simply taken for granted. But what sets it apart from other Pixar gems is that it's the animation studio's most inclusive for-the-whole family adventure to date.It's no surprise to anyone anymore that Pixar leads field in terms of computer-generated animation and while ""Up"" continues this tradition, that's not its specialty. ""WALL*E"" is still more of a spectacle and innovator. ""Up"" is Pixar's proof that they can combine beautiful, heart-filled storytelling with laughs for every age group and adventure and action to boot and *still* make a killing at the box office.On premise, most analysts wouldn't predict a film about 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen ballooning his house to South America to honor a promise to his late wife to be even close to a box office success in the genre of animated family films, but attach the name Pixar and anything is possible. Dogs with collars that turn their thoughts in words and the dynamic between a young boy scout named Russell who accidentally was on Fredricksen's porch when the house took off and an old man prove to be more than enough for great comedy and entertainment.Sure, the plot itself once they get to South America leaves something to be desired, and the feasibility of an old man who can't walk down his stairs being able to hold onto a dangling rope with a boy, a dog and a large bird on the other end will fail to suspend many adults' disbelief, but there is never a moment devoid of something clever or meaningful in the entire film. The fresh and humorous concept proves quite forgiving as does the touching motivation in the story of Carl doing this for his dead wife. The montage through their years together is incredibly powerful for happening so early in the film. Pete Docter and Bob Peterson do an excellent job, though obviously Pixar's constant success must be credited to John Lasseter. Next to ""WALL*E"" whose innovation, imagination and genius themes might never be repeated in animated film, ""Up"" is Pixar's best to date. There is honestly something for everyone: the elderly will relate to Carl's struggles with aging, loss and unfulfillment; children will find plenty of physical humor to enjoy between the hysterical dogs and Russell's slight lack of smarts; and the ages in between will find the story touching and the concepts and their execution nothing short of genius. And for once, Disney is even politically correct/inclusive in the diversity of characters.","

"PipAndSqueak","11 October 2009","Technically this is a wondrously perfected piece of animation. Seen in 3D it is on occasion very close to real - the coat of one of the dogs was very lifelike for example. As an entertainment I don't think its intended audience is really children. It's for parents and other adults who are generally child friendly. The story effectively pokes and evokes emotional responses. I cried at one point and it was evident to me that the whole audience at the cinema I attended were also similarly affected. This is an incredible feat for animation - but not unknown. The heavy emphasis on sentimentality however, I found detracted from the Lost World Adventure story that it should really have been about. Admittedly, the Venezuelan scenes were beautifully done, the was even a rainbow on the waterfall - as occurs in life, the subdued mood created by the first segment of the film could not be erased. It's a lovely piece of work - but don't go with a child who has recently lost a grand parent.","

"seruanyre","20 January 2023","""Up"" is a film that is truly a work of art. The animation is stunning, with each frame feeling like a painting come to life. The story, about an elderly man who fulfills his lifelong dream of traveling to South America by attaching thousands of helium balloons to his house, is both heartwarming and emotional. The opening montage, which tells the story of the main character's life in a few short minutes, is a masterclass in storytelling and will leave audiences in tears.The voice cast, led by Ed Asner as Carl Fredricksen, is fantastic. Each actor brings a unique energy to their respective characters and the chemistry between them is palpable. The film is also full of humor, both subtle and slapstick, that is sure to delight audiences of all ages.One of the standout elements of ""Up"" is its commentary on growing old and living a life of regret. The film presents a powerful message about chasing your dreams and not letting life pass you by. It is a film that is sure to inspire and uplift.","

"treeline1","13 June 2009","When Carl was a little boy, he was fascinated with the daring exploits of Charles Muntz, the famous explorer. Then he met Ellie, and she shared Carl's passion for adventure. They had a long and happy life together, but now that Carl is alone, he doesn't want to do anything but be a grump. One day he meets a young scout named Russell and his life changes; maybe Carl has one more adventure in him, after all.I'd heard this animated film was touching, and sure enough, ten minutes into it, I was reaching for a tissue and sobbing. The movie deals with love and loss, and adults who have experienced this may well get more out of the film than children will. It's all about doing what you always wanted to do and it's very good.Ed Asner provides the voice of the old codger Carl and I liked him more than I thought I would. Christopher Plummer is the villain who's not really very menacing at all. The little boy, Russell, is a bit annoying in his helplessness and naiveté, but Dug, the dog is so adorable that I would see the movie again just for him.While not quite as memorable as Pixar's ""Wall-E,"" this movie will leave you with a smile on your face and a lump in your throat.","

"TxMike","12 November 2009","Saw it on DVD, great sound and great picture.From PIXAR, the same group that gave us one of my favorites, ""Monsters, Inc"". Although the two movies are quite different, one might even say totally different, I will compare them. Each has a very compelling story to tell, and the superb animation and voice acting are present to support the story. Many of the animated movies in recent years have looked superb, but suffered from very marginal stories.In ""UP"" we see what can best be described as a love story. Two kids meet quite randomly, and long before they know what ""love"" is really all about, but they turn out perfect for each other. They get married, make plans for the adventures they want in live, grow old together, and find that somehow ""real life"" has gotten in the way of their dreams.All this we see in the first few minutes of the movie. It sets up the fantasy, that an old man just living out his life can attach enough helium-filled balloons through the chimney of his little house to not only float up into the air, but also float to South America to a spot that he has dreamed about since he was a small boy. Our logic says this can't really happen, just as our logic tells us children don't really have power-generating Monsters in their closets at night. But this movie is not about logic, it is a fantasy.This is an interesting, exciting movie with superb animation. But the real pay-off is in the love story, which isn't totally wrapped up until the very final image we see.SPOILERS: As the young couple were growing up, they had an image, a hand-drawn picture which they placed on a photograph of the cliffs and waterfall in South America. The hand-drawn image was of their little house they dreamed of building on that site some day. That day never came. But through his perseverance and as the helium in the balloons finally lost their ability to keep the little house off the ground, it settled down to that very spot they had imagined all those years. He had finally given his wife, now deceased, the little house on the cliff.","

"meeza","8 June 2009","Upsy daisy! It's time for you to wake up and read my quirky pun-induced film review of Disney Pixar's ""Up"". Not up for it? Come on, it will lift your spirits up! OK, enough uppers already! Do not want it to be a downer for you guys. ""Up"" is yet another creative Pixar tale about a lonely geriatric widower named Carl Frederickson who fixates on fulfilling his deceased wife Ellie's wishes of flying their house to a paradisiacal land in South America. This idea might not fly with many, but grumpy Carl just wants to be happy by his lonesome in his own isolated South America Paradiso. However, Carl did not expect a junior wilderness explorer to come along for the ride. What's up with that? Russell is the aforementioned boy scout who accidentally gets stuck in the house during Carl's upward liftoff. Nevertheless, Frederickson was in no mood to be ""bringing down the house"" even with Russell on board. Frederickson and Russell end up landing in the paradise land (house and all), and there they befriend a talking dog named Dug and an eccentric female bird who Russell names Kevin. Their nemesis comes in the form of the devious explorer Charles Muntz who masters a pack of menacing talking dogs. So therefore, Frederickson and Russell are confronted with plenty of ""ups"" and ""downs"" during their adventurous experience. There are many humanistic elements in ""Up"" such as aging, loneliness, acceptance, and detachment that many kids might not be up for; but provides invaluable life lessons on character education to our future generation. ""Up"" does play with your heartstrings plenty, so bring a hanky! The former Mr. Grant, Ed Asner, was granted a perfect role to voice as Frederickson; that impressed me Ed Asner! (Only ""Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" fans got that pun upper). Bob Peterson's tender & uplifting screenplay was superb while Pete Docter doctored a successful directorial uperation of ""Up"". Big Thumbs Up for ""Up""! ***** Excellent","

"kchaney-80787","26 June 2021","The movie up is great for both adults and children. The theme of the movie is much clearer to adults but the fun music and colors and amazing animation throughout the film intrigues its children's viewers. The director and editor have created a flawless film that will be a classic for many years in my book!The editing is spot on. It seems to be smooth and natural from beginning to end. The scenes fade in and out creating a natural movement throughout the movie. The editor uses a creative juxtaposition in the beginning of the movie by creating a montage. This allows for time compression and cohesion in the movie as well. The montage is of the characters Carl Fredrickson and Ellie Fredrickson. In the montage the viewer can see how the 2 characters met as children and fell in love. It shows how they grew up and got married bought a house and found out that they could not have children. It shows how they grew old and finally how Ellie passes before Carl.This portrays Carl in a more human way. Without this montage the viewer would only see a cranky old man who was mean and did not want to go to a new home. However, because of the montage the viewer has sympathy for Carl. They can understand that this was his home with his wife who he misses. He feels like he failed her by not giving her the adventure of paradise falls and he is holding on to his home in memory of her. This is very effective in developing the plot of the movie.Sound is also used to provide smooth transitions in the film. There are times when the music used is a happy upbeat tone and then slow and sad when Russel thinks that Carl is going to leave him and not allow him to help. The music in the end of the film as it shows Carl and Russell's new relationship is happy and upbeat. It allows the view to increase their emotional connection to the scenes being portrayed in the film. The bright colors are faded in and out during these transitions as well all tying in the viewers emotional connection.The them of the movie can be seen as adventure and love but also forgiveness. Carl must learn that while Ellies adventure was not Paradise falls it was their life together. Carl must have this adventure with Russel to forgive himself and learn to be happy in the everyday moment!","

Don't get me wrong, its a good movie, but its one of those movies where if you can work out the perfect way the story should go- thats what you'll see. The opening montage of the life of Ed Asner's character with his wife is as damn near a perfect arc of a life as you'll likely to see...and the tears come exactly on cue. through much of the film when you see certain visual images or verbal references, you realize that you'll see them later on. Its a perfectly constructed film, possibly the most perfectly constructed film that Pixar's made, but at the same time it's the most artificial. Pete Docter has fashioned the most perfect of animated, nay, of any films from all of the best stuff in the world and he forgot one key thing, heart and emotion, real heart and deep emotion. Yes I was moved and yes I was carried along, but at the same time I didn't feel completely part of it. I didn't really feel the real emotion. I didn't feel the emotional connection of Wall-e and Eva, I didn't feel the joy of Peter O'Toole's food critic at the end of Ratatouille. the ""Claw is our Master"" in Toy Story is still better then ""look a squirrel"". I know I've complained about almost every Pixar feature, but even in the bitching there was real emotion and not manipulated emotion.I'm annoyed, I wanted to cry at the end, I didn't.It is one of the best of the Pixar movies, but I liked it I didn't love it.(And yes while the casting of Christopher Plummer is choice, they shouldn't have made him look like Kirk Douglas unless they were going to use Douglas. I know Douglas has medical problems but, damn it would have been nice to hear him leaping into action.) (and perhaps the one real flaw...too many dogs)","

"paudie","21 October 2009","Pixar and Disney have again come up with the goods with the funny and touching movie.The first ten minutes show a young Carl Fredriksen (voiced by the legendary Edward Asner), fascinated by the explorers he sees on newsreels. He meets a kindred spirit in Ellie and we see their life together until she passes away. This segment lets us see Carl's character and is very moving.Carl continues to live alone in his house until a run in with a developer sees him destined to be shipped off to a retirement home. Facing this prospect he decides to go to Paradise Falls, an almost mythical place he and Ellie had always meant to go to but never did.Here the film really takes off (see what I did there?) as Carl opts to travel via his balloon-fuelled house. Only when he is in the air does he find that a boy scout in search of a last merit badge for helping the aged has become an unwitting stowaway.Our odd couple eventually land near their destination but trouble awaits as they cross swords with an unexpected jungle resident.I didn't see the 3D version but the animation is still brilliant with the colours of the jungle amazingly vibrant. The story is also excellent. We empathise with Carl and his young friend as they reveal their stories and come to rely on each other. The chase sequences are straight out Indiana Jones and breathtaking (even in non-3D). While there is a ""message"" it isn't rammed home at the expense of making the film enjoyable.One small complaint would be the film is perhaps too long at over 90 minutes and dragged a bit towards the end. So, while it is not as good as the peerless ""Toy Story"" it is a very enjoyable film for all ages and well worthy of being listed with the other Pixar classics.","

"krational66","28 April 2020","Do you believe in love?
I trust you.When do we start not to believe in love, when do we start not to talk about permanence, when do we start to worship the material stripped of the faith in love itself. We're used to getting into and out of one relationship after another, and seeing it as an exercise in love. Our world is too impetuous, impetuous to no heart to seriously manage a life - long relationship.However the reality that we say on the lips can not cover up however the longing of heart to everlasting and everlasting, that kind of holding hands and children together in the day after day years of the warmth of the precipitation down bit by bit. Through the morning sun, if the person sleeping around us is never changed, I think it will be the most perfect gift from god to us.UP is for those who still believe in love, but the warm picture makes people unable to stop tears. Let me take the risk with our dreams, the cross across my heart is my lifelong commitment to you. I want our house to be rooted in Paradise Fall, the place you've always wanted to go, and I want to help you fulfill your childhood aspirations.
But when I finally got to the place you've always wanted to be, I found out that since you met me, your adventure ended up with me for life.
Thank you for the life-long adventure.See here, tears streaming down my face.We do not need another irrelevant person to practice love, we do not need to follow the outside impetuous to toss about love, we do not need a dare not long for the everlasting person to spend our love. It's not love.I met you in a crowd of thousands of people, and I fell in love with you for a long time. This is a chance that everyone has several times in a lifetime. If it happens, then you fall in love with me, too. Then this may be the most beautiful gift that god has given me.So, let such a feeling back to nature, let the early morning sunshine on your face, let the passage of time quietly engraved in your brow, let the accumulation of years bloom a consistent gorgeous love.If I fell in love with that person, or that person fell in love with me. Please work hard on this relationship. It's a long, long life adventure, but as long as you're here, I have the courage to make it happen.Or maybe in the end we can't be together for life, but as long as the heart has been believing in love, then we once the adventure will become a memory that will never fade, hidden in the memories.This is a movie for people who still believe in love, in the adventure of a lifetime, that you may be my end.Thanks to the movie UP, which was almost missed, we can still find the love that was almost forgotten by us in the noisy world. Also thanks for sliding through the eyes of tears, let us find that the original shed hypocrisy and secular we still long for a lifetime of happiness.I believe in love,
Because I believe in you.","

"kyle-cruse","17 July 2009","Pixar has, in my opinion, delivered the finest computer animated films to date. However, Pixar's three entries before this film (""Cars,"" ""Ratatoille,"" and ""Wall-E"", though most people will disagree with me on the last one) were, I feel, lesser entries. The last three did not have the overall appeal value that the previous films (""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" etc) had. ""Up"" is a pleasant surprise in nearly every way. What a fantastic concept this film has, featuring a house floated away by a massive amount of small helium-filled balloons (I mean, who doesn't think it would be neat to have their house fly?) Of course, a great concept deserves an equally well-written plot and screenplay, and this film pulls off both of those. The film involves Carl, an old man trying to keep his late wife's dream alive by going to Paradise Falls to prove that their childhood hero, explorer Charles Muntz, was not lying when he said he had traveled there. Along the way, he picks up a young boy scout and a few animals to continue the journey together. This film features who is probably the all-time greatest movie dog character, Dug, a dog who says just what he thinks due to his automated voice collar. What a brilliant concept, rather than the overused one involving animals talking with moving lips. There's too much to share about this film in one review, but the most important thing to say is that I recommend it. It's visually stunning and full of laughs, excitement, and real emotion, with characters we learn to care about. If you're one of the few people who hasn't seen it yet, now's the time, while it's still in theaters.***1/2 out of ****","

"RainDogJr","5 June 2009","Last year's Pixar production had the best possible reviews, I remember going to see WALL*E expecting to experience what for many people it was: the very best Pixar film. I loved WALL*E as much as you fellow reader but I don't consider it the very best Pixar film, it is not even one of my 5 favourite Pixar films, hell I haven't felt desires to buy/rent its DVD, I haven't felt desires to watch it for the second time. I just saw Pixar's latest production (in 3-D and it looks, as expected, just wonderful!) Up (Peter Docter directed it being his second Pixar film. His other, the 2001 Monsters Inc., is my second favourite from Pixar) and for me is just as wonderful as WALL*E and Ratatouille (another film I haven't seen since I saw it for the very first time on the big screen back in 2007) but like those two films it is not one of my most favourites from Pixar.Anyway, the preview I saw of Up didn't allow me (thankfully) to see any characters but only the main ones: the old man Carl Fredricksen (voice of Edward Aisner) and the kid Russell (Jordan Nagai), the preview showed the old man with his floating house and later realizing that he had a guest. But Up actually begins when Carl was younger than Russell, when Carl met Ellie (Elizabeth Docter), the girl that just like him loved adventures, loved exploder Charles Muntz, the girl that eventually became the woman of his life. All of what Carl and Ellie shared is fantastically told, is realistic, touching, is a really great part of the film. The director Peter Docter said this: ""the message of the film is that the real adventure of life is the relationship we have with other people, and it's so easy to lose sight of the things we have and the people that are around us until they're gone. More often than not I don't really realize how lucky I was to have known someone until they're either moved or passed away. So if you can kind of wake up a little bit and go, ""Wow, I've got some really cool stuff around me every day"", then that's what the movie's about"". Ellie passes away, then we move to the present with Carl, the present is still realistic and also sad, no country for old men certainly, the destiny of Carl is to go to a retirement home but then the extraordinary begins, then the dream of Ellie as kid of having her clubhouse in Paradise Falls is the one and only objective of Carl and well Carl will not leave his house and is satisfying as hell! Like almost everybody I knew that at one point Carl was going to use lots and lots of balloons to make his house fly so for me the ""weird"" stuff began once Carl and Russell (he is a hilarious character, you will love him and well he being a wilderness explorer was trying to earn the ""assisting the elderly"" badge ended in Carl's house) arrive to South America, I was like ""talking dogs in the middle of the jungle?"", this stuff with the dogs is really hilarious. It works like with the elderly (Carl certainly and also Charles Muntz, yes Carl will meet his hero who now owns the bunch of dogs and lives in Paradise Falls just to capture a weird bird that Russell calls Kevin!), I mean on one hand we have the extraordinary: talking dogs, all the amazing movements that Carl and Russell do in the course of the film, the dogs being chefs, etc. And on the other hand we have the realistic moments (apart of those from the beginning of the film, from the story of Carl and Ellie) : the dogs being totally controlled by that who has the ball or the food, the elderly having problems to fight (hilarious scene!), etc. The deal is that the film always works, and well Up is just another triumph for Pixar! 9.5 out of 10","

"zetes","31 May 2009","And they don't disappoint at all with this outing. It's probably not their best work. That's Wall-E. It's not as tightly plotted as other Pixar flicks, and the villain, in particular, could have used more work. But so what? Really, I haven't enjoyed a movie this much since, well, Wall-E. The prologue of this film, especially its second sequence, a completely silent (except for score) exploration of a long, beautiful marriage that gives us a novel's worth of information in a mere 8 minutes, is so remarkable that I could not hold back tears. In a way, that's a minor flaw as well. The film never quite tops those first 10 or 15 minutes. But the remaining 70 or 80 minutes are a ton of fun, and touching in their own way. Pixar shows Disney that cute animal sidekicks can be completely charming and hilarious. Dug the dog who talks with his special collar is constantly hilarious, as is the goofy bird, nicknamed Kevin. Like I said already, the villain is weak and could have been more thoroughly characterized. But it's not too bad - that's made up for with his more villainous talking dogs. Villainous they certainly are, but the way they talk, still thinking like dogs, is always worth some big laughs. And there's also a cute kid who is in no way annoying. Pixar proves once again that it has more imagination, wit and charm than anyone else working in the medium today. And that medium is not animated features, but cinema itself.","

"honorhorror","14 June 2009","Saw it in Bangkok in 3D, found it overwhelmingly touching for a cartoon. If the movie can keep you concentrate on its sentimental side for the whole 2-hours ride, it surely can make you think it's the best animated film ever made(as currently at Top 18 of IMDb Top 250). The film doesn't falls short in technical aspects. The characters, objects and everything are animated in a way that they're not bound by the physics rules. The scenes are not so different from a combination of The Incredibles and Cars, but they are assembled professionally and made their own credibility. You can prematurely conclude that a movie casting an old fart as the main character may not be vividly colorful, but that definitely is wrong. You will find the color of good old days' memory, color of freshness and color of life in Up, and you don't have to try to get it.The story, basically the same formula implemented by Pixar, has indeed succeed again. After Wall-E and Up, we can safely say that, there are not any common senses that Pixar dare not break. So don't argue about how many balloons can bringing up a house, or how was the house floating so steady without proper operation, or how did another old fart get the technology of a dog voice box after locking himself in mountains half a century. Just sit and take it for what it is and enjoy. Family ingredient is the true star of Up, which took me to tears twice in the first 20 minutes. If ever you get a stubborn but loving family member, you will cry too. And after all, it's the sentimental value that saved its climax and ending from being a run-of-the-mill fun.However, there is always a however. Since Pixar made Wall-E, Up will not escape from being compared to Wall-E. The screenplay of Wall-E totally blew me away from beginning to the end, but Up's energy is halfway leaking like the balloons on the house. The fist act, so touchingly executed, totally promised too much for the rest of Up to bear. After Charles became a menace, the movie became predictable at all. You can tell the bird tried to escape but failed, the old man has to struggle between his house(a symbol of all the sentimental value summed up) and the righteousness(saving the bird), you can also tell what choice he's gonna make and how he's gonna overcome his own issue. It's also obviously rigid that the writer tried to combine old Carl's emotion breaking through and the rescue mission. At last, it's sad for me to find it predictable because it's like suddenly waking up from a beautiful, touching dream.But, this doesn't prevent the whole cinema from laughing through the movie and appreciate the efforts makers put in it. This is still, a great film in every aspect.You definitely need to bring your family to it. The children will learn, the elders will sigh and sob, and all of them will enjoy. Sometimes it has a darker and heavier undertone than Wall-E, but the final result is still as up-beating as a balloon.8.5/10 A fierce competitor in Oscar, but may be beaten this time.","

"Matt_Layden","31 May 2009","After living in his home for most of his life, Carl is suddenly surrounded by skyscrapers and construction. They want to buy his house so they can tear it down and build a retirement home. He will have none of this and decides to use thousands of balloons to literally lift his house 'up' and soar to a place he's been dreaming of going since a kid.There's a bit more to the plot, but I don't want to divulge that information. Going into the film not knowing about it might have a stronger impact on you. Up, which is yet another fascinating film from the geniuses at Pixar is vibrant with colour, full of laughs, tugs on the heart strings and is an adventure for both kids and adults. I never thought a film that had to really old characters in the lead roles would appeal to the young ones, but Up surprised me. In fact, it really surprised me, hearing about the concept I thought that Pixar finally had a dud on their hands. Nope, not this time.Up is one of my favourite Pixar films, up their with last years Wall-E and The Incredibles. The film is unique and inspiring. I doubt you'll find such quality film making from any other animated film, Pixar has set the bar time and time again. Up, while not visually stunning or powerful as last years Wall-E takes a different route and uses vibrant colours to draw attention to itself. The characters are cartoonish and the story itself could never be based on any reality and for a film about an old guy in a house with balloons, it's mighty adventurous.Every Pixar film has a message that their cleverly slip into the excitement and Up is no different. We go on this journey with Carl and the young boy scout Russell, Carl at first does not like Russell, nor does he want him around. These two characters are at opposite ends of each other, one old and quite, the other young and talkative. Of course by the end of the flick they bond. Also along for the ride are two side characters, Kevin the colourful native bird of Paradise Falls (they place Carl wants to finally see) and Dug, a dog who can mysteriously talk. Dug is not the only dog who can talk though, the place is full of them, all trained to open doors and fly planes. They all heel to their master Charles Muntz, who has spent his life trying to capture Kevin.Up is not only funny, fun and exciting, it packs a few emotional scenes too. Some people might want to bring some tissues, while it's not a sob story it is one of the few Pixar films that have moved me. What happens to Carl happens to everyone, so you can relate to him. You are immediately grabbed by him and his story and the film has more emotional punch in ten minutes of dialogue free montage then most dramas or romance films today can say for themselves.There are a lot of words to describe Up: Delightful, endearing and whimsical are a few, but one I will choose to employ is heart. Along with Wall-E, Up has the most heart out of every other Pixar film I've seen. The film has a PG rating though, only other Pixar film to have this is The Incredibles. The Russell kid is shot at and people die, at times I was thinking would kids be scared of this? I don't think so, nothing horrible ever happens that could traumatize a young one in my opinion.I did not bother to see this film in 3-D, I've heard it doesn't give enough 'pop' to warrant the additional money on the ticket. Seeing it at a regular theatre will not hinder your viewing at all. All the voice acting is top-notch and perfect casting with Plummer and Asner. See Up in theatres while you can, it is one of the year's best.","

"Dello_","14 April 2020","I loved ""Up"": it is a great movie with some touching moments and a fantastic score. In particular the most impressive thing is the narration of the love story between Mr. Fredricksen and Ellie that is powerful even without a word because of the music and of the inspired images. The general idea of the movie is very original and the plot does a great job in entertaining the viewer. The characters are relatable and well characterised. It would have been truly an amazing movie if not for those dogs. They are so frustrating because they are so childish in a bad way. Being for children is not a problem and indeed I love animated movies but these dogs were terrible and they are used like the random NPCs you have to fight against in every videogame. And this is very bad because the messages that the movie tries to convey are important and mature and the dogs are really out of place. Even with this problem ""Up"" is still a great film you should watch at least once!","

"DICK STEEL","7 August 2009","Much has been said about the opening montage, and I fully agree that it's an extremely touching sequence in itself, bringing out and establishing the lonely character of Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner), a man living out his twilight years, finally deciding to take the plunge and fulfill a lifelong dream and a promise made. If the first few minutes doesn't make you cry, then you must have a heart of stone, or never loved before.What transpires in the film is more or less captured in the trailers already, with Fredricksen lifting up his home with thousands of helium filled balloons, off for his adventure of a lifetime, only to find a stowaway, little wilderness explorer Russell (Jordan Nagai) scared stiff on his front porch. While the boy offers to become Carl's sidekick for that final badge of honour to be promoted to senior explorer, little did he know that he too is up for a crazy adventure in South America, joined by a talking dog Dug (Bob Peterson) and an endangered bird, to Carl's dismay as they detract him from his mission.While seemingly implausible in many ways (for instance having the flimsy contraption the size of a house with perishable balloons survive a mean thunderstorm), in order for the narrative and plot elements to work, you have to accept what's going on with a pinch of salt. Pixar has so far never disappointed me with its films, and Up continues the company's successful box office juggernaut by reminding everyone that it's all about the story first, the strong characters next, and animation just going about getting the job done.It's a moving tale about loss and the prospect of letting go. Essentially it's a Carl Fredericksen story, where through the interaction with his new found friends, as opposed to fiends such as contractors and developers eyeing his property, discover new meaning to life, and a second chance for that sense of adventure that's been buried by life's unfortunate ups and downs. While a chapter has been closed in his earlier life of companionship, herein lies another opportunity to live out a new adventure, no point sitting around and mope in self pity. It's quite uplifting in that it's full of hope, yet dishes out enough nostalgic reminiscence that makes you all warm and fuzzy inside.There were two moments that I particularly enjoyed, outside of the opening montage. The first was that parallel with The Fountain, where one is tasked to complete a beautiful experience by making new ones, on one hand never to forget, but on the other never to make a crutch of an excuse out of it, and to move on. The second was how life as depicted unfolds itself in phases, where the unexpected can crop up and derail even the best of intentions and plans. But so long as you have someone to share the spoils with, good and bad, then perhaps everything else is tolerable.If there's a complaint about the quality of the 3D here, then I must say that amongst all the 3D live action and animated ones shown here to date, Up is unfortunately most disappointing of the lot because there wasn't much sequences that maxed out its 3-dimensional ability. You might just be better off with the 2D version, to save some cash for films that are truly designed to envelope your senses, rather than just to provide some depth of field.Up is utterly moving, a romance story if you'd like in its inner core, filled with plenty of lovely moments that never lose you, and punctuated with adequate and well timed comedic. The short film that preceded Up, called Partly Cloudy, also served as a great appetizer to the feature, and reinforces the notion that a simple tale about a stork and a cloud that addresses the perennial children's question on where do babies come from, and without dialogue at that, can still move you if told in a way that's sincere and full of heart.","

"sandnair87","29 April 2015","Up begins with a poignant montage of our protagonist Carl Fredricksen (the unmistakable voice of Ed Asner) and his partner Ellie as they meet as fledgling broods, only to fall in love. Thrown together by a shared spirit of adventure, particularly the escapades of a spirited explorer Charles Muntz who dazzled the world with his discovery of Paradise Falls, Carl and Ellie are forced to shelve their plans to move to this ""exotic lost land"" as life, as always, gets in the way. We watch the couple deal with the ups and downs, joys and tragedies of life; and gradually we watch them grow into old age, Ellie's 'My Adventures' scrapbook still unfilled, even as her time on Earth ends. This wordless, eloquent, effortlessly heart- breaking sequence is sure to melt even the iciest of hearts.With Ellie gone, Carl becomes a crusty codger, faced with moving to retirement home for the rest of his days. But he has another idea, one involving the inflatable leftovers of his previous career as a sidewalk balloon vendor. He decides to honor the promise he made to his dearly departed adventure-loving wife and take one last shot at adventure! Carl hitches thousands of helium balloons to his rickety old house, rigs a steering system and 'Up' he goes. But he is not alone. There's a pint-size accidental stowaway aboard: Russell (an endearing Jordan Nagai as Carl's comic foil), an eight-year-old Wilderness Explorer scout set on earning a badge for assisting the elderly, who happens to be on Carl's porch right when the house takes off. Together they embark on an eventful journey that brings them face to face with unlikely travel companions - both friends and foes in the form of talking dogs, an enormous squawking bird and the reclusive Muntz himself - as they arrive in Paradise Falls. By the end of their escapade, they not only become thick friends, but also learn an invaluable lesson about what really matters most in life; a lesson that imbues Up with a strongly beating heart. Pixar once again outdoes itself with Up, a vibrantly bubbly exploration of how life's great adventures can stem from death's gloomy depths. From a distance, Up may seem to be an old-fashioned adventure story, but filmmakers Pete Docter and Bob Peterson utilize the off-the-wall premise to consistently enthralling effect. The chemistry between Carl and Russell plays a pivotal role here, with the pair's various misadventures heightened by the flamboyant supporting characters and breathtaking visuals. Never has the sight of a thousand balloons looked as glorious as it does here, while the mountains, canyons, and dense forests of its South America bristles with life.Up is so human and relatable that it feels like it's more than just a mere animation - it has more heart and soul in its tiniest pixel than most live-action movies can boast in their entirety. No matter how you look at it, through the innocent eyes of a child or the wider, wiser world-view of an adult, the bright, buoyant 'Up' brims with imagination, adventure, humor and heart. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but you won't fail to be lifted!","

"jake-law123","8 June 2010","Not only is this the second greatest Pixar film aside from Toy Story, but its the most emotional. I was in tears on so many scenes that I had so much crust in my eye the next day. The music score is irresistible, the animation is unbelievably smooth, and the characters are hilarious. The plot itself is also quite clever. Carl Fredrickson is a 78-year-old man who sets out on a quest with an annoying little boy scout named Russell to Paradise Falls in South America, the place of he and his deceased wife's dreams, until they encounter a giant but extremely rare animal hunted down by a famous hunter, which causes problems. Although plot may seem to be falling at times, it kicks itself right back up, with clever scenes, following the ridiculous occurrences. It all fits well as can be. Similar to other Pixars, with more emotionality. Absolutely fantastic! The perfect film for kids and adults.","

"merrywood","3 June 2009","The best cinematic thing the Walt Disney Company has done in the past half century is tie in with Pixar, a group of brilliant animation filmmakers founded by John Lasseter who left Disney for Lucasfilm in the early eighties and Ed Catmull who was made the head the new company's digital imaging at that time under new corporate head, Steve Jobs. We all know of their extraordinary success. The films appear to just get better as the years roll by and fine writers are located and brought aboard.UP is a quality peer of the best animated feature films ever made. However, somewhat unlike the first two Disney animated features, Snow White and Pinocchio. These two are as yet to be surpassed in enduring contentwhat the great director, Frank Capra, once told me, ""Something to put in their pocket and take home with them."" It's what I call spiritual content, that is, subtext that speaks to the soul.Thus, unlike the first two classics made under the auspices of Walt Disney himself, however, UP is a bit light in its spiritual core and heavier on action and storytwo good attributes of all Pixar features, and in this case with strong sentiment and heartwarming scenes. However, this lack in formula always shortens the legs of all features, live action included.Another fuzz-ball in the lens is the contemporary use of well known voices such as Ed Asner, who does a commendable job as the lead character in UP, Carl Fredricksen, but whose voice clearly kicks off real life images from the brain's memory bank which then conflict with the animated character's image on screen.In 1978 while researching my first place national book festival prizewinner, The World of Animation, at the Walt Disney Company in Burbank, I interviewed several people that had worked with Disney in the mid to late 1930s and was also associated for some years with Shamus Culhane who worked on both of the first two Disney animated features. As a brief sidebar, Jimmy (Shamus)Culhane's name was left out of the of Pinocchio credits because he quit Disney before that film was released in order to help (and in addition for an erroneous health assumption) the Fleischer brothers in Miami on their first two animated featurestwo films not so successful due to poor scripting but both features that had charm: Gulliver's Travels and Hoppity Goes to Town.As for Shamus, most of the scene where Pinocchio sets out to school with an apple for the teacher and meets the fox and cat was animated primarily by Shamus.Shamus and others who were there at the time of Snow White's production confirmed that the reason that Walt Disney used Adriana Casellotti's singing voice, totally unknown, instead of Deanna Durbin's or Judy Garland's in Snow White, for example, was primarily because of the image conflict that does occur with audiences when they hear a very well known voice speaking for an animated character with which we are trying to identify. Today nearly all (but not all) American animation studios use celebrity voices in contrast to the very early years. They also pay top dollar for these voices, a completely unnecessary budget expense.All that said, UP is a wonderful animated film and not just for children, another idea that Walt Disney had that has often been forgottenthat animation is not just for children. The feature animation from other nations bears this out.","

"disdressed12","31 December 2009","this was a fairly enjoyable animated film from Disney/Pixar.there's some funny moments here and there.it's touching without being too maudlin or sentimental.there certainly is a fair amount of action as well.the story is also good.there a few scenes of minor peril which might be a bit too much for younger children,and the movie fleetingly touches upon a sad topic.for the most part,i enjoyed the movie.i did think however,there were a few scenes that were probably intended to be funny,but came across flat and pointless in my mind.all in all,pretty good effort,just not as good as i hoped or thought it would be.for me,Up is 6/10","

"wooly_ompus","16 July 2010","...is the first thing I thought when reading the synopsis for Up. An old man borrowed with life attaches hundreds of weather balloons to his house to fly to South America. Along the way he meets up with a young boy scout, a giant colorful bird and a talking dog.Seriously if I hadn't heard this movie wasn't being done Pixar I would have brushed off the movie completely, thinking it nothing more then a stupid, childish animated movie with one too many fart jokes. Even after hearing that Pixar was attached to this film, I still thought the movie would failed.....oh boy was I wrong.Up is a masterpiece plain and simple. It's takes a crazy premise and makes it deep, confronting and oddly relatable. Makes otherwise annoying and one dimensional characters deep. And makes the audience look on in awe one minute, laugh out loud the next and then cry their eyes out finally.There certainly is something to be said about a movie which can make you blubber like a little girl 10mins in only to do it again in the last 20mins. Hopefully I've said enough.","

"D_Burke","30 May 2009","I'll be honest. I was prepared to be disappointed when I went in to see this film. As I said in my review for ""Wall-E"" last year (which is at this link if you want to read it: ""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/usercomments-293""), Pixar is the only 3D animation studio that has not made a bad or even mediocre film yet. I was a bit skeptical about ""Up"" not because of the recent news that Disney is worrying about its commercial appeal, not because of the unrealistic plot elements (and there are some), but because after nine great movies, a misfire could be on the horizon. Fortunately, ""Up"" is far from a misfire. Like the other Pixar movies, it takes an intriguing, original plot line and creates a masterpiece of a story with humor and heart.The main character of this story is someone who has the least potential to be made into an action figure, which is probably what is making Disney stockholders nervous as of the date this review is being written. Carl Frederickson is reminiscent of Peter ""Ralphie"" Billingsley (from ""A Christmas Story"" [1983]) as a child, and a cross between James Whitmore and Mr. Magoo as an elderly man. Although his image won't send kids flocking to toy stores, it doesn't really matter. Some great movies have been made with senior citizens as the main characters (""Cocoon"" [1985] and ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" [2002] come particularly to mind), and it's about time Disney make one.The most appealing thing about Carl Frederickson is his character. From the moment he appears on screen, audiences immediately get a sense of his happy times and times of loneliness through a clever series of montages in the beginning. There were probably many old men in Hollywood who could have supplied his voice, but Ed Asner was perhaps the best choice. Asner gives Frederickson a voice that is curmudgeonly without being too off-putting, similar to his Lou Grant character from 1970's TV.In the first 20 minutes of the movie, you grow such an attachment to Mr. Frederickson that you can't help but feel like cheering when his house takes off with the help of balloons he spent all night blowing up. Therein lies the point of the movie where you really have to suspend disbelief. Of course this number of balloons can't pick up an entire house, let alone be blown up in one night without really careful planning. And if you spend too much time wondering how the floor of the house didn't stay on the ground, along with the pictures and other breakable assets in the dwelling, you will miss the point of the movie, not to mention the fun of it. The house is really a symbol of seeking new adventures while hanging on to where you came from all along, at least at first.The basic premise expands with the addition of Wilderness Explorer (or Boy Scout, minus the legal ramifications) Russell, arguably the Donkey to Mr. Frederickson's Shrek (sorry, Disney, but it's true). Russell is a very funny character, and doesn't miss a beat from the moment he comes on screen reading his Explorer book verbatim. The two main characters played off each other very well with witty dialogue and precise comic timing. Take away the comic relief of the talking dogs, and the down-to-the-hair strand awesome CGI animation, and you'd still have a great film with these two characters alone. The Russell character simultaneously adds a lot of well-needed heart to the film, actually making even me feel bad for the potential extinction of the otherwise annoying bird companion Kevin.In an emerging subplot, Kevin the bird is hunted down by a Charles Lindbergh/Howard Hughes-inspired adventurer named Charles Muntz, voiced with the right touch of menace by Christopher Plummer. The Muntz character is perhaps the first Disney villain who you don't want to be a villain, especially after seeing the faux newsreel clips in the beginning of the movie. He's a self-made man who's spent his life chasing a dream, sort of like Mr. Frederickson is by dragging his house to South America. He's also killing a bird that many, including Frederickson, finds annoying. However, if it hadn't been for the perfect moral balance between him and Russell, it would have been very hard to root for Mr. Frederickson until the end.The movie, on the whole, is probably more over-the-top than any other Pixar film made to date. You know many kids in America have a toy collection as diverse as the ones Andy has in ""Toy Story"", and that humans could create a smart robot like ""Wall-E"" someday. But anyone who spends their time wondering how Mr. Frederickson planned to survive after moving his house to the South American clip, or how the hose he's pulling doesn't break off the house, is missing a great fantasy adventure with many awe-inspiring takes on life. To paraphrase the theme song to ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"": ""If you're wondering how he eats and breathes, and other science facts, repeat to yourself 'It's just a show, and I should really just relax'."" On a personal note, having just lost a grandparent who, in the last years of her life, refused to go to a nursing home because she loved the house she had lived in for nearly 40 years, I'm sure the setup of the story will strike familiar tones with many older audience members. I know it did with me, which is why the film was so touching and heartfelt from beginning to end. Hey, I may even be in that situation one day where I love a house so much I would even consider flying it away. If I actually considered doing it, I would hope that 50 years from now they would have more advanced flying equipment to do it with.","

"TRobertRomero","25 April 2023","Up, released in 2009, is a cinematic masterpiece that manages to be both heartwarming and heart-wrenching. Directed by Pete Docter and produced by Pixar Animation Studios, the movie is a poignant exploration of life, love, and adventure. The animation is stunning, and the characters are memorable, making Up one of Pixar's greatest achievements.The story of Up follows Carl Fredricksen, a grumpy old man who embarks on a journey to South America in his house, which is lifted by thousands of balloons. Along the way, he meets a young boy named Russell and a colorful cast of characters, and they have a series of thrilling and emotional adventures. The film explores themes of grief, friendship, and the importance of living life to the fullest, and it does so with humor and heart.The animation in Up is breathtaking, and it captures the beauty and wonder of the natural world. The film's opening sequence, which depicts Carl's life with his wife Ellie, is a masterclass in visual storytelling, and it sets the tone for the rest of the film. The character design is also exceptional, with Carl and Russell each having unique and memorable features.The music in Up is another standout aspect of the film. The score, composed by Michael Giacchino, is beautiful and moving, and the use of music in the film is both subtle and powerful. The film's signature piece, ""Married Life,"" is a hauntingly beautiful composition that perfectly captures the emotional resonance of the story.The voice acting in Up is superb. Ed Asner brings Carl to life with his gruff and lovable performance, and Jordan Nagai is excellent as Russell, a plucky and endearing young boy. The supporting cast is also exceptional, with standout performances from Christopher Plummer as Charles Muntz and Bob Peterson as Dug the dog.One of the most impressive aspects of Up is its emotional depth. The film explores complex themes of loss, regret, and the importance of human connection, and it does so with sensitivity and nuance. The movie's emotional impact is powerful, and it will leave you moved and inspired.The attention to detail in Up is remarkable. The film's sound design is exceptional, and every sound effect is carefully chosen and executed. The movie's use of color is also noteworthy, as it creates a rich and immersive world that is both beautiful and terrifying.Up is a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. It celebrates the joys of life while acknowledging the pain and loss that come with it. The movie is a cinematic triumph that will leave you awestruck and inspired.In conclusion, Up is a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it has received. The animation, story, voice acting, music, and attention to detail are all exceptional, and they come together to create a film that is unforgettable. Up is a must-see for anyone who appreciates great storytelling and animation, and it is a testament to the power of cinema to inspire and move us.","

"CharlesVonFunhammer","30 May 2009","I'm a big fan of pixar movies, I think finding nemo, ratatouille and Wall-E (though to be fair I didn't like Wall-e either the first time I saw it) are some of the best examples of narrative storytelling in the last 20 years. Simply put, the Pixar clan know how to tell stories.That's why I was so surprised when I saw up. Now, maybe my expectations are too high, but I found it to be one of the weaker Pixar efforts. And here's a few reasons why.1. It draws on associated emotion, not real emotion. Much of the sadness in the film (and this is a sad - not happy movie) isn't earned. It comes from referencing other films and our own associations - specifically at the beginning. The opening montage goes by so quickly, as a scrap book, that it falls upon cliché to create the emotion. Granted, for many people this will work, because to be honest, there's something affecting about seeing cartoons go through ""serious"" emotions. Yet, these scenes lack the depth of having our characters go through real actions and real feelings. Things happen, the characters don't do anything - they let things happen to them. (and example is that Russel's (spoiler) parents are divorced. This scene is handled in a clichéd and associated way. So and so's not my mom! Heard that one before...) If you enjoyed the opening montage, watch Mr. Holland's opus - that movie does this same thing better.2. This movie isn't funny. All of the best jokes are used in the trailers/commercials. Much of the comedy is played too subtly (not subtle, but too subtle) and passed over too quickly. There's never a clear moment of what the movie is trying to make us feel at any given time - which brings me to 3. Tone. Is this a comedy, is it a melodrama? The movie doesn't really know what it is or is trying to say. It's inconsistencies constantly set up a new series of expectations which are never followed through on. It's serious...I'm thinking it's going to ... oh wait, a joke...wait...4. The narrative. The movie takes about 2 acts to find itself as a movie. Carl meanders though the film trying to take his South America. He wants to put his house down, and every 2 minutes a new complication arrives. Then, in the third act, he battles the old and now evil (how old is this guy supposed to be if Carl is 78?) Charles Muntz. He comes to defend russel and dug, and the bird. He finds a purpose - the movie finds itself as a movie! Finally...but by then we've spent 2 acts trying to get into another story completely.4A. there are a lot of clever storytelling devices, there is a good story here. It's a matter of the storytelling and dramatic devices the filmmakers use to elucidate that the story that are weak.5. The characters. Between Carl and Russel (shout out to the Asian community) we have a weak set of characters. The most interesting character, Ellie, dies. Her passive husband is left - the into to him shows how awesome she is. What did she see in him anyway? what did he do? Russel is kind of an idiot spaz. why should I root for someone who's so incompetent? If Pixar can animate characters with big heads and big eyes, everyone will think it's cute. Great date movies, great for kids, and hipsters. The overall storytelling I felt was pretty weak in UP. It felt like it was rushed off without knowing precisely where it was going - which is a joy to watch in the other pixar movies. Brad Bird and Andrew Stanton make you feel like you're in the hands of a master who is taking good care you - who is guiding you and surprising you, but never doing something you're not enjoying. Up is very muddled film-making. It's not horrible, but it's much weaker than the other films.cheers.","

"Stampsfightclub","3 November 2009","Carl Fredricksen (Asner) sets out to Paradise Falls to fulfil his life long dream by tying thousands of balloons to his house, but is unaware of Russell (Nagai) on his porch.The only way is up for Pixar. We say it year after year but there is simply no stopping the mighty animators from producing yet another masterful picture.Last year Wall-E brought about their biggest ever gamble by reducing the dialogue to a minimum and telling the story through physical humour and scene settings with enough semiotics to appreciate the earth's decline.And now there is Up. The first 3D picture to open Cannes film festival went down a treat with critiques and fans alike and now in cinemas across the world smashing records once more, they really have soared.I must confess, seeing the trailer I was slightly apprehensive and concluded this was it, this was where Pixar would go down. Carl seemed grouchy, the puns used appeared ordinary and the plot seemed exceptionally thin. I hold my head down in shame for judging this on its trailer.What we have here is yet another wondrous ambition of life that will break the heart, make the kids laugh and make you feel ultimately rewarded.The opening sequence of Carl in the cinema as a young lad watching his hero on screen sets the tone for the film's central dream concept as Carl meets a fellow youth and the pair share the same adventurous spirit. After an hilarious fall and a sweet how you doing moment the film dives into a silent montage of their life together and when Carl hits a stopping point his life falls apart and until he has no choice, does the house start to fly and the adventure well and truly begins.When watching a Pixar or a Disney picture you have to bear in mind the realism of situations. The unlikeliest is high but this is meant for entertainment and it certainly delivers it. The physical science of whether the house can fly based on helium balloons is open to the guys in the labs but this is an imaginative attempt to portray childhood ambition and it succeeds through this.From talking dogs to an undiscovered bird this has adventure written all over and the fun never stops once the house is up. Russell provides that childhood innocence and ambition to give Carl food for thought and with flying dogs, an explorer with a deadly secret and charming dialogue this spells happiness for the entire family.As more and more animations are now made with 3D in mind this picture was evidently more focused on the plot. Impressive but there are exceptionally few moments with actions coming out at you, like in Coraline or Monsters vs Aliens.Irrelevant in my opinion as we have here the best animated picture this year with a charming plot with humorous characters and marvellous ambition.","

This film was not just another goofy animated romp, however. It was surprisingly touching with some deep themes, while also strikingly original and altogether great! While a little slow in places for the toddler set, it nonetheless grabs hold of your heart and doesn't let it go. am not a fan of animation movie but when i saw Up, i was lost for words. was very much emotional for me and I loved every minute of it, and left the theatre with a big smile on my face...a must see movie!","

"Jeremy_Urquhart","20 May 2022","I don't know, Up is very, very good, but I don't think it's quite great. Of all the Pixar movies up to and including Toy Story 3, I'd say the only movies I like less than Up are A Bug's Life and Cars (the latter of which is easily the worst). But the third worst movie of Pixar's first 15 years is still a very good movie, which I think really speaks to how great their initial run of movies was.I think what holds it back a little for me is that I don't find it as emotional or moving as most people. I can appreciate the opening is sad, but it's never really moved me or made me personally sad, which is strange, because the tearjerker Pixar scenes usually get to me (like the Jessie flashback in Toy Story 2, the opening of Finding Nemo, and all the stuff intended to be sad in Inside Out). Other minor flaws? I think the villain is a bit weak. He has little to no redeeming or understandable qualities, beyond ""he's crazy because he's been stuck in the jungle for 60 years."" The way he comes across as okay and then reveals himself to be villainous like three minutes later just feels so awkward to me. Also, while I appreciate the music and the way that main theme changes throughout, I don't really like the theme to start with. I find it kind of grating, even if it technically and thematically works.Where this movie does shine is in the animation, the humour, and the bond that forms between the two main characters. All the stuff with the dogs is great, too- I know that's the part of the movie that's most obviously aimed at the kids in the audience, but it's still the part of the movie I love the most.The story is told well, and the voice acting is all good too. I just don't find it as moving as most Pixar films, I think the villain is a bit weak, and I think it has one of my least favourite music scores of any Pixar movie. But it's still good- it's solid and entertaining, just not quite great, in my opinion.","

"rzajac","7 September 2009","A friend warned me that I would feel disappointed by ""Up"". He said it just wasn't as clever and complex as Ratatouille or Wall-E or other past Pixar offerings.But another friend saw it, and recommended it, so I behooved myself to check it out.I agree with my first friend that ""Up"" is a narratively relatively modest undertaking. But I also feel that what it does achieve is notable.It's taken a while for certain aspects to come to the fore in my mind. However, I did immediately notice one honest and useful moral: For all his exertions, Fredricksen doesn't get to really have an adventure until he lets go of a frozen, romanticized version of ""adventure"" that got stuck in his character makeup at an early age. I thought it was great how the story sets this up and creates the situation where he has this breakthrough. Very nicely done.And then there were other interesting things the film achieves. The pacing of the story is odd. In a way, it's hard to say whether this reflects daring or ineptitude on the parts of the folks responsible for the shepherding the narrative. But, in the end, I have to say there was something grand about the way the story rolls along slowly and yet also with a lot of strength. It's as though it aspires to be operatic; with an emotional depth that tries to match the breadth of the spaces and times involved. Sort of like ""Waiting for Godot"" meets ""Dennis the Menace""! I should mention that, about halfway through the film, the pace gets picked up, and stays ""up"" for a long time; a bit ""too much"", in my book, and quite likely a nod to the kid customers in the audience.And then there's that whole side story of Fredricksen's deceased wife (no spoiler there; you see this coming from a mile off). Very nicely done.With the proviso that, indeed, you will see something a bit different from prior Pixel work--no harm in variety!--I can recommend this movie.","

"djansen24","13 November 2010","Pixar, who never seems to make a wrong step, steps right again! And this film shows no sign of a studio exhausted for ideas. This is one of their best films in fact. What I love about Pixar is their attention to detail, story, and treating their characters with respect. They make complex stories feel simple and effortless by the mastery with which they tell them. And on top of that, they dazzle the eyes and are just plain fun as all get out. When listening to how they developed the story for UP from the director's commentary on the DVD, I felt as if I as an audience member was being treated with respect and even being nurtured and cared for. They took great pains to bring something to life that would touch my soul and enchant me. Yes, UP has a few dark moments, but the undercurrent is sweet and hopeful, making the experience delightful through teary eyes. It is a must see. One note of caution: because of the maturity of some of the subject matter, I would not recommend it for little little kids. Perhaps 5 and above would be a good start. I feel the ""married life"" scene while easily the best moment of the film would be too emotionally hard for them.","

"MatthewLong23","31 May 2009","UP is a movie that both adults and kids will enjoy. It starts off very sad as you see the main character and his wife throughout the years and the hardships they have endured. The main character ends up loosing his wife and stays at home all day refusing to let people take his home until he injures a man who breaks his mailbox he made with his wife. As a result he is going to be sent to a nursing home but before they take him he unleashes balloons attached to his house, which lifts up his house off the ground so he can go to South America which him and his wife always wanted to do. Unbeknownst to him, a little boy was under the house at the time, who needs to get his badge for helping the elderly. The boy is funny and brings most of the humour to the movie but it's really about friendships and doing things you love. The annoying things I found were the talking dogs. It was funny with the dog they meet but having so many was just annoying.","

"Lejink","31 March 2012","Another enjoyable Pixar production right here, this time doing for the elderly what ""Toy Story"" did for infants. It does fall a bit too obviously into the formulaic last half hour big chase with the bad guy, which in this particular feature I think was going along perfectly well as it was. Maybe that's just the adult in me, so I'll chalk up the first half of the film for me and the second half for the kiddies.I particularly liked the prologue in which we get the potted life story of Carl and Ellie, the film subtly making the point that life goes on even when you're old and widowed. I might argue that the feisty Ellie character actually seemed to have more going for her than her more passive husband and that I missed her in the second half. I also didn't appreciate the fact that it was their childhood hero and inspiration who turned out to be the baddie and of course cuteness must have its place in any Disney feature and here we get a double dose with Doug the dog and Kevin the err...big bird.However the crotchety old Carl Fredricksen is a fine creation and even more so his keen-as-mustard adventure scout assistant, Russell, the film also reminding us that the generation gap needn't be so wide. While there are fun moments and good laughs to be had, I was most taken with the marvellous animation, as so often is the case with Pixar. In particular the scene of the first ascent of the house with its multicoloured balloons sending it skywards is a visual treat (it's a pity they give this away in the promotional material) as are the first, rainbow-tinged views of Adventure Falls. The vocal characterisations are excellent, with Ed Asner as frosty old coot Carl and young Jordan Nagai as young whippersnapper Russell while the background music is likewise enjoyable and apt.In summary then, another Pixar treat, although like I said from a purely selfish point of view, I do wish they would abandon the routine mini-Indiana Jones big finish, no matter how flashy and superficially thrilling it might be.","

"diac228","30 May 2009","However they do it, whether it is by steroids, stem cell, Egyptian secrets, Babylonian water, or selling their soul to some monster, Pixar has been providing hit after hit, success story after success story since 1995. Surely they don't profit as much as their rival Dreamworks, but Pixar's films have lasting appeal that can and will span decades and generations to come. I severely doubt a century from now we'll remember Shrek or Madagascar the same way. Pixar's strategy has always been top provide tugs at the heartstrings for every time they deliver a laugh. This mix of comedy and drama has served them well in the past, with Finding Nemo and the Toy Story films being the absolute best examples. Up on the other hand, has overwhelmingly more drama and sad moments than laughs. If you can survive this little shift of film-making from Pixar, then you are in for a treat. Up is yet another grand film from the company that seems to do no wrong and it has great appeal for moviegoers of all-ages.Up is about Carl Fredrickson, a retired bitter old man whom is still reeling from the loss of his wife. Since children, they had a dream about going to Paradise Falls, a secluded location in South America. In her honor, Carl heads out on a quest to South America using his house, and thousands of balloons. Accidentally accompanying him is Russell, a trusty boy scout. Along the way, they'll meet all sorts of characters and more adventure than they could have ever imagined. Written by Bob Peterson (Responsible for Finding Nemo, need I say more?), the film explores themes of loneliness, letting go, life and friendship. The script excels with plenty of adventure, funny moments, and sentimental moments that will make you sniffle a bit.Forget 3-D. It's a stupid trend that will soon go away. The movie looks absolutely beautiful in 2-D and does not need any special effects for it to be appreciated. The people and animals themselves are composed of different shapes, representing their personality. Unlike in other non-Pixar efforts, realism (in terms of people) wasn't attempted, instead focus was on detail. The movie is amazingly detailed, but the production didn't demand as much complicated animation like in Wall-E and Ratatouille. Nonetheless, the film looks great, and yet again proves that Pixar is on top of the animation heap.The main strength of Up lies in the action and its characters. The film has plenty of exciting and perilous moments that keep you guessing how it's going to end. And then, there are the hilarious characters. Carl himself is likable, but doesn't provide as many laughs as Russell, and the eventual animals that are involved in their quest (especially the hilarious dog Dug with the special collar). Up falls more into the category of The Incredibles rather than Wall-E or Ratatouille because of its immense amount of peril. There's nothing wrong with that, just telling you it's not the Pixar fare you've seen in recent years.Like previously stated though, Up is a very tough pill to swallow in terms of its dramedy. The first ten minutes of Up are among the most heart-wrenching in recent memory, and towards the climax we have another moment in which you can't help but feel that lump in your throat. This sort of heavy sentiment has not been present in any non-Pixar animated film this decade, not even Shrek. It is hard to make a cranky selfish old man likable or sympathetic, but like in Finding Nemo with Marlin, knowing the past definitely clears all confusion and answers all the questions we would ask about their challenging personality.Bottom Line: Pixar strikes gold yet again, and in the form of a very creative story about an old man searching for adventure. All the elements that worked in all the Pixar films of the past are present here, and associated with a superb musical score by Michael Giacchino. The only reason you wouldn't like this film is if you don't like Pixar at all---in which afterwards it will be followed by questions concerning your taste in film. Ranking this film, I'd place it somewhere between The Incredibles and the original Toy Story as one of the 5 best they've ever released. How do they do it? It has to be steroids, there's no other explanation.When you're with Pixar, the quality of film has nowhere to go but Up.Highly recommend.","

"FilmFanatic03","17 October 2010","PIXAR has done it again! A wonderful, clean, family fun film for all ages to see. PIXAR have gone down the more emotional route which is interesting as it will widen the target audience as it is slightly more mature but it really helps with our understanding the character of grumpy Carl. We understand what he has been through and truly empathise with him. There is great character development and PIXAR have managed to create substantial, likable and funny characters. Such as Russel the cute, chubby, quirky kid who tags along with Carl for the adventure of a lifetime. There is Kevin the bird who simply steals the show, Kevin is really funny and very likable (Kevin is so cool) Doug the dog is genius, PIXAR managed to capture the characteristics of a dog in his voice and Carl goes on a character journey along with the audience. It rightly won an Oscar a sit is truly a wonderful animation to be loved by all.","

"ShootingShark","15 October 2009","Carl Fredericksen is an elderly widower whose house is in the middle of a building site. Rather than be evicted to the local old folks home, he ties thousands of balloons to his house and literally flies away to South America for an adventure. However, unbeknown to Carl, he has a well-intentioned stowaway on board This is Pixar's tenth movie in, and the quality of their work is quite simply outstanding. Up is a wonderfully original story about an irascible old man, a likable fat boy, a talking dog and an embittered adventurer from a bygone age. It's a crazy, almost farcical plot, but yet the characters are so carefully observed and real seeming that you are swept along by the beauty of it. The wordless montage of Carl and Ellie's marriage at the start is an extraordinary five minutes of animation. Russell, the Boy Scout do-gooder, is a genuinely great kid - he's goofy, a little sad and he keeps the story moving nicely. The Lost World environs - lush groves, rocky tepui plateaus and dazzling waterfalls - are all rendered with exquisite detail. Although the story takes some swallowing, nothing about the movie seems forced - Carl's growing fondness for Russell, his reluctance to let go of his past life, his resolve to help rescue the rare bird - all flow as smooth as silk. Most importantly, it's hilarious throughout, with comic scrapes aplenty, crazy situations, lots of madcap moments (""Squirrel !"") and genuinely funny characters. The small voice cast are great; eighty-year-old Asner and eight-year-old Nagai make a lovely team, and co-director Peterson steals the movie as both Dug the heroic Golden Retriever and Alpha the scary Doberman. Deftly scripted by Docter and Peterson with actor Thomas McCarthy, and featuring a beautiful score by Michael Giacchino which weaves in and out of the action, adding much suspense, humour and pathos. In the Pixar tradition, the movie is preceded by a wonderful short film called Partly Cloudy, directed by Peter Sohn. Do not confuse this with the 1976 Russ Meyer movie of the same name, or you may never recover !","

"StevePulaski","20 November 2013","The first fifteen minutes of Pixar's Up play like a full-length movie, featuring a reserved amount of dialog and a beautiful collection of clips that show a childhood friendship that amounted into a healthy, lasting relationship that ended in sadness. The relationship was between Carl, a shy young boy who idolizes the explorer Charles F. Muntz, and Ellie, an eclectic young girl who turns an old, rundown home into a headquarters for her club. The two meet out of nowhere one day, spark an immediate, offbeat friendship predicated on their love for exploring new places, get married, and endure decades of happiness before nature takes its course and Ellie passes away. Up details this in a beautiful, unforgettable fifteen minutes, leading to one of the most impacting scenes of animated emotion I have ever seen.Carl (voiced by Edward Asner) is now elderly, living in the aforementioned rundown house that acts as an island in the center of construction in the big city. Suits try to get Carl to sell his home, but he refuses, until seemingly admitting defeat after an incident with one of the workers turns violent. Carl manages to strap thousands of balloons to his home and, utilizing a complex steering system pioneered by his wife for fun when they were kids, manages to lift the house from the ground and sail through the vast, open blue skies. His destination is Paradise Falls, located in Venezuela, an exotic land where him and his wife always believed they'd reside.However, unwanted company accidentally hitches a ride in the form of Russell (Jordan Nagai), a totally harmless little boy scout anxious to obtain his ""helping the elderly badge."" Before taking off in house, Carl instructed Russell out of kindness to capture a beast that has been tearing up his yard, and Russell returns on Carl's front porch to state his success when he is unwillingly taken up, up, and away along with Carl's entire home. The two wind up sticking together on this trip, both getting more than they bargained for when a nearly extinct bird and an unconventional talking dog turn up in their path as well.If there was ever a film to prove even the most hard-hearted that animation can be a wondrous medium that is capable of showing deep emotion, Up is the one. Writers Bob Peterson and Pete Docter (the Monsters, Inc. franchise) have successfully crafted Pixar's most adult script in terms of theme, focusing on the ideas of death, tribute, and closure, but capturing it in such a way that will not bore or miss the mark with young children. It wouldn't be far-fetched in my eyes to call Docter ""John Lasseter Jr.,"" since he possesses ambition akin to Lasseter's early animation days.If anything, this is thanks to the Docter, who utilizes both his directorial efforts with Pixar to create some of their biggest films in terms of visual scope and range. Monsters, Inc. featured an unprecedented amount of visual flair and colorful content. Consider the scene that took place inside the factory of many doors the monsters could use to enter a young child's bedroom. In one shot, when Mike and Sully are desperately holding on to one door, hundreds, if not thousands of doors are shown in just one shot. In several shots in Up, hundreds, if not thousands of multi-colored balloons are shown, which I'm sure posed and animating nightmare for the production team. The film had such a lengthy production history, a list of ""production babies"" - babies born during the making of the film - reaches about thirty or so children.The plot of Up works as a piece of escapism because it seems to be everyone's fantasy at one point or another - the fantasy being the ability to escape life's current issues by abandoning them entirely and having to answer to no one. In an essence, the film is a staple of what all animated film should include: lovable characters, a beautiful sense of adventure, the right amount of emotion leverage, extraordinary action sequences, and adult themes tackled in a digestible (but not condescending) way for young children. The revolutionary aspect of Up comes while watching this, realizing that animation is not just a timekiller for children, but an unbelievable art-form that will no hopefully no longer go shortchanged in discussions concerning cinema.Voiced by: Edward Asner, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, and Christopher Plummer. Directed by: Pete Docter.","

"MidnightWarrior","30 May 2009","I am now convinced that all these people who loved this movie must be trolls. This film DOES NOT deserve the high rating. I repeat, it DOES NOT deserve the high rating. Before you watch the film, you are presented with a short film called Partly Cloudy. At first it starts off pretty innocent, but then delves into some garbage about how storks bring these awfully cute babies to their parents. And then it goes on to show you that the clouds went on to create these babies. Absolute garbage! Some of us prefer to be upfront, responsible and honest with our children. We would never teach them this! Granted you have to have a suspension of disbelief to reality when watching films, this kind of theological idea is forced on the audience. Worst of all, it was Unnecessary.Now onto the film. The best thing I can say about this film is the graphics were spectacular! It's east to see how much money was invested in the technologies to make this product. Next I'll say that my favorite characters were the talking dogs and the bird! They were INCREDIBLE! In fact, they could have made a stand alone film and it would have done very well. Bob Peterson is an excellent voice talent choice.Now onto the bad. For starters, the content is inappropriate for this film. The first 5 minutes are drama laden, saddening and very, very depressing! Right off the bat, the audience falls in love with Mrs. Fredrickson as a child and onward. For some reason, the script writers don't let this couple achieve their dream of traveling together; every time they save up, they have to spend it on something else. Then they also show Mrs. Fredrickson have a miscarriage. And then later, she dies.Let me remind you that this all happens in the first FIVE minutes of the film! I kept thinking as I watched this film, ""gosh, this is depressing! I feel terrible!"" Disney films are supposed to leave you feeling like a million bucks! Good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people - this is how it should be in the Disney world. Second, unless you are an annoying, chubby eight year old or a rigid old man, you'll have a hard time relating to these characters. By the time something actually happens to either of them, it's hard to care about them. Countless times, I found myself rooting for the other, no human, good characters or the bad guys.You can't get me to like you by feeling sorry for you. And that's what this film does to the main character.I was expecting something like the pixar film, ""Meet the Robinsons,"" but this was NOTHING like that.","

There are some heart-rending scenes here, and there are plenty of fun, cute, and nail-biting ones too. It's a very well-rounded package. It's probably more suited for adults than children, unlike something like Toy Story.It is a movie that will cause you to reflect on your life, and your happiness within it, particularly in relation to a romantic interest/loved one.I'll always remember the memory book scene in which Carl discovers Ellie's last message to him, and I'm currently paraphrasing here: ""Thanks for the adventure. Now go have a new one."" With this sentiment in mind, Carl hurles himself into the fray, saves the boy, defeats the villain, and adopts the adorable Dug as his master.Stop reading this review and watch it.","

"Reel_starz","31 May 2009","When I first saw the trailers for Up, I was skeptical. How interesting can it be to watch an old, cranky man and an impossibly optimistic, chubby kid float around in a house held in the air by balloons? As it turns out, it can be very interesting. The latest film from Pixar, the tenth in their roughly decade-and-a-half history of success, is, in parts, a comedy, an adventure, a buddy movie and a romance. Each genre is blended with the others to create a funny, entertaining and emotional story.One of the first things that helps make Up so compelling is the pitch-perfect voice casting, particularly of the two leads. As the movie's protagonist, Carl Fredrickson, Ed Asner is delightfully gloomy and cantankerous, delivering his lines with just the right balance of sarcasm and sincerity to make the audience genuinely care and root for a character that would be otherwise extremely unlikable. Newcomer Jordan Nagai provides his character, Russell, whose peppiness could easily have been irritating, with energy, enthusiasm and enough feeling to prevent Russell from becoming a caricature. Of course, a brief cameo by Pixar regular and ""lucky charm"" John Ratzenberger, who is the only person to have been part of the cast of all ten Pixar feature films, as a construction worker doesn't hurt. Though he usually has minor parts, it would be very odd to see a Pixar film without him and his very distinctive voice.Even if it had not been available in 3-D, the visuals in Up would still be stunning. Vistas of a jungle and waterfalls act as an almost jaw-dropping backdrop without detracting from the story or characters. The attention to detail is phenomenal. Even though by now, computer-animation is considered the standard, one cannot help but be amazed at how realistic the film looks. Perhaps even more impressive is how Up uses 3-D technology to its advantage but never allows it to overwhelm the plot, relying on it to immerse the audience in the film instead of cheesy, pop-off-the-screen gags. The color palette, alternately bright and more neutral, really adds life to the film. In fact, the animation and visuals are so well-done that it seems as though Up would be just as entertaining if there was no sound at all, only images.But, of course, as great as the technology utilized in Up is, it's the story and characters that really engage the audience in a tender, emotional experience. What has distinguished Pixar movies from other animated films in the past is the way that it focuses on getting across a story worth telling instead of using the story as a vehicle to tell the jokes. Also, from Toy Story to Wall-E and Up, Pixar movies have appealed to both kids and adults. This appears to be the one of the only studios that realizes that animation is just another medium and that it can be used to tell grown-up stories with mature themes as well as tales that please kids. Though it has its share of laughs and jokes that will make people of any age crack up, the themes and messages that Up explores are decidedly serious. Unlike many recent animated films whose messages usually consist of ""Just be yourself"" or some variation on that, Up focuses on death, loss and, ultimately, the importance of moving on and not letting grief keep you from realizing your dreams. In a world of cynicism and restlessness, its plea for people to recognize life as an adventure, that you don't have to travel to far-off places to experience excitement or grandeur, is especially relevant and crucial. Up is about ordinary people that do extraordinary things in equally extraordinary places before realizing that it is often the simple, boring things in life that bring the most joy.The only major flaw is the presence of a villain. Voiced by Christopher Plummer, Charles Muntz has little role to play than to provide an excuse for lengthy (albeit admittedly thrilling) action sequences. He feels unnecessary and in fact hurts the movie by forcing it into the typical villain-trying-to-kill-hero-for-no-real-reason formula. Though Muntz's canine sidekicks are colorful characters and sources of humor throughout, it seems as though the movie would have been better off without a central antagonist and instead used the relationship between the two protagonists as the main conflict. Knowing Pixar, they could have made Up just as entertaining and more innovative if the formula was ditched in favor of a more character-driven story about self-discovery.However, despite that flaw, Up was a thoroughly enjoyable and heartwarming movie with surprisingly likable characters. It had, not surprisingly, incredible animation that was used in support of a simple yet profound story and helped convey timeless messages of letting go and enjoying the ordinary and complex journey that is life.","

The film could've started without it and still be fine but this first 10 minutes enhances the overall quality so much. It's so emotionally powerful, fun, and great. Even though I didn't love the rest of the film to the same degree as it, I still enjoyed the film a lotFirst of all, have you ever seen a concept of a flying house assisted by balloons? I really liked Doug and Kevin, even if it's sort of a children's movie cliche but its executed well so it makes it enjoyable for me.It has some pacing issues but it wasn't annoying in any way so it can be forgiven since the climax is exciting! It was kind of ironic how a 100 year old man was still boxing and beating up everyone but yeah, the climax was very endeering, fun, funny, and I specifically liked the scene where Karl views his old adventure book after splitting up with RusselRating: 8.5/10, Very nice film!","

"moviesleuth2","30 May 2009","Toy Story. Finding Nemo. Wall-E. Based on its pedigree, it is not unreasonable to go into a Pixar movie with high expectations. However, Pixar's newest film is a disappointment compared with its past efforts. That being said, a less-than-expected Pixar movie would not be construed to mean that UP is a bad film. It's good, but not great.Carl Fredrickson (Edward Asner) is a fan of the famed explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). His friend and future wife Ellie, is also a fan. Together, they plan to go to Paradise Falls, just like their hero. However, circumstances prevent them from doing so, and after Ellie's death (and the inevitable future of a nursing home), Carl gets his chance. However, he has an unexpected stowaway: a Wilderness Explorer (think Boy Scouts) named Russell (Jordan Nagai).The film works, I guess, but it's plagued by a number of problems. FIrst and foremost, it has some logical deficiencies. The premise of ""Up,"" a senior citizen traveling to South America in his house lifted into the sky via thousands of helium balloons (the size of balloons that one would get at the zoo), requires a sizable suspension of disbelief. I had no problem with that, or with any unbelievable acts associated with it (such as a senior citizen and a boy who couldn't be more than 10 pulling the house by themselves). I did think about them, but I was willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt. However, I was not able to ignore the film's handling of the villain. I couldn't understand why he did anything that he did in the film (I'm treading carefully to avoid giving away anything). The villain acted in ways to service the story. This severely hurts the film because it runs with the idea that didn't work in the first place.More importantly, it fails to really connect with the viewer. Pixar films like ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Toy Story"" worked because they established a connection between the viewer and the characters. ""Up"" tries, but ultimately fails to do so. The film is all about adventure, but except for one scene, the film failed to get that energy flowing through me.At least the voices are good. Edward Asner makes a good Carl Fredrickson. He acts exactly like a cantankerous old man, complete with the cane and arthritis. However, he does grow a heart. Newcomer Jordan Nagai is excellent as Russell. Russell is an energetic young kid, but he has a tendency to talk nonstop. Carl finds him irritating, and the dialogue is hilarious. Christopher Plummer is unrecognizable as Charles Muntz, the famed adventurer, and that's all I'll say. The best vocal work goes to Bob Peterson as Dug, the dog. He's hysterical. If a dog could talk, I'm positive it would sound exactly like Dug.I won't stop you from going to see ""Up."" It's fun, but don't expect another ""Wall-E.""","

"tfrizzell","1 July 2009","A cantankerous widower refuses to give up his house which is right square in the middle of major skyscrapers being built everywhere around his old neighborhood. Eventually he tires of everything and decides to literally lift his house to South America with the help of thousands of balloons and complete a childhood dream he once shared with his late wife. His adventure is interrupted by a young boy scout who just happened to be on the porch when liftoff occurred and thus the duo head to a new continent together. Excellent achievement in every way imaginable as Pixar once again outdoes itself with a wondrous cinematic technological achievement. The story is outstanding early and then stays strong in spite of its second act (which prominently includes a paper thin villain who has exiled himself since the 1940s because he is trying to catch a rare animal with a pack of dogs who wear collars which allow their barks to be translated to English) which wavers a bit, but still comes through by the finale. Ed Asner and Christopher Plummer are the most noteworthy voices found within. Another computer-generated gem of outstanding film-making. 5 stars out of 5.","

"george.schmidt","1 June 2009","UP (2009) **** (VOICES OF: Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, Delroy Lindo, Jerome Ranft, John Ratzenberger) Pixar continues their streak of instant classic animated fare outdoing themselves in arguably one of their very best: widowed codger Carl Fredricksen (voiced with gruff yet lovable zeal by Asner) finds himself being forced to vacate his life-long home and instead decides to (finally) go on a promised adventure to Venezuela by tying literally thousands of balloons to his home and aloft from its mooring sail away to Paradise Falls. Along for the ride is stowaway Russell (Nagai in an affective vocal turn for a youth), a 9-year old Wilderness Scout wanting to assist the elderly for his final badge of honor, much to Carl's chagrin. Written and directed with flair, style, humor and most importantlyheart, by Pete Docter and Bob Peterson (who provides hysterical voice work as Dug, a 'speaking' dog the duo encounter, who steals the movie), the film transcends all ages and truly inspires magical moments that will have you feeling like a kid again while crying through your laughter (the early montage of Carl and his wife-to-be Ellie is for the film vault that ranks up there with any Chaplin flick; silence is golden). My pick (so far) for Best Film of the Year and hand's down Best Animated Picture come Oscar time; one of the year's very best films and one you should see immediately!","

"glorynowner","6 August 2022","Even trailer made me cry when he goes up mountain alone. For a few perilous moments in the middle of ""Up,"" I began to suspect that the folks at Pixar just might be about to register their first major stumble in the studio's hitherto flawless reign as ""king"" of the computer-animated film (a reign which began with ""Toy Story"" all the way back in 1995). But, like the airborne house that floats at the center of the story, the movie eventually righted itself and sailed off smoothly into the wild blue yonder.This generally wistful and enchanting film tells the tale of Carl Fredricksen, a grumpy old man whose beloved wife, Ellie, has recently died, taking their dream - of traveling to South America, to a place called Paradise Falls, and setting up home there - to the grave with her. When Carl is threatened with eviction, he hatches a fantastical scheme of attaching hundreds of helium-filled balloons to the house and flying to South America on sheer wind power alone. This he does, accompanied by an adorable little tyke named Russell, who just happens to be caught under the porch at the moment of liftoff.So far, so good, as ""Up"" captivates us completely with its imagination, its lyricism and its charm, along with its visual homage to such earlier classics as ""The Red Balloon,"" ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Around the World in 80 Days."" There's also a stunning montage sequence which chronicles - without narration or dialogue - the complete married life of the Fredricksens, starting with their wedding and ending in Ellie's eventual death.The trouble for ""Up"" begins to rear its ugly head only after Carl and Russell have arrived at their intended destination. Here they are confronted by a number of strange and exotic creatures, including a hitherto unclassified species of bird and a bunch of dogs who've been given the ability to speak by some sort of shadowy mad scientist who's clearly up to no good in this remote corner of the world. At times, we begin to suspect that once the writers, Bob Petersen and Pete Docter, came up with the idea of launching an old Victorian house into the stratosphere, they never really figured out what to do with it once they got it up there. But the messy mixture of science fiction and jungle melodrama they've come up with is unworthy of all the quality work that has come before it.Yet, what eventually saves ""Up"" from crashing and burning in its second half is the wonderful voice work by Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai, the soaring and sweetly romantic score by Michael Giacchino, and the theme that sometimes our yearning for adventure can make us so myopic that we fail to perceive the ""adventure"" that's happening right in front of our eyes on a day-by-wonderful-day basis (more shades of ""The Wizard of Oz""). These alone are enough to compensate for the occasional narrative misfires, a made-to-order villain, and an overabundance of drooling, snarling pooches that feel strangely out-of-place in a tender and lyrical fable such as this one.The animation and backgrounds aren't quite as rich and compelling as they were in Pixar's previous two ventures, ""Ratatoille"" and ""Wall-E,"" but the less spectacular look actually makes ""Up"" a more contemplative, relaxing work to sit through.","

The story is well-written, emotional and laced with humorous moments, but it did not leave a particularly strong impression on me. The animation is good, with an interesting use of color, but nothing breathtaking. Everything in this movie is very good, but not great. Other than two completely unnecessarily cruel scenes (miscarriage and death of the main villain), I have nothing specific to complain about. But the movie just didn't move me.

I don't worry about what kind of movie it is going to be, but if it is Pixar then it's definitely going to watch-movie-for-sure list. Just look the improvements from the first to the latest. It's all refreshing. Simple stories. So simple, yet powerful. They create memories... no... they become a part of our memories as we experience them. The animation, the dialogs, the plot twists, the texture and the special effects brings life into each character and reality to the background portrayed. And, as I watched Up, I can imagine the hard-work, dedication and love put into this masterpiece. The movies before Up I keep them under the categories of comedies. But, Up is an exception. First, this movie is a drama, then it is a comedy. Yes, my friends. It is a drama first. Though, Wall-E is cute and moving, Up is emotional. The movie is true to its very soul. This movie actually brought tears. At times it lit up a smile on our faces in a way that is very understandable. Add a bit of action, adventure and humor to this drama and the resultant movie is a true masterpiece. Pixar always manages to surprise and amaze us in a way no animation movie ever could. As you can see that I am not mentioning even one scene from movie, it's because it is not a movie to be explained nor said, but truly a movie to be watched and experienced.Pixar has done it again. The magic still exists. As always, Pixar rules the world of animation. I give it a 10. No questions, asked. The movie deserves it totally...","

It isn't as though they may not have fun watching it, as the visual effects are quite stunning, or they might not get a giggle or two from a few scenes, it's just that in order to fully appreciate the film you must have been in love at some point in your life...or at least comprehend love to the fullest extent.I would categorize this movie as a romantic comedy/action thriller for adults had it NOT been an animated film. As you may have heard it is nothing from what you would expect in the commercial previews. However, it is pleasantly unexpected. Had I known a thorough synopsis through the commercials, as some films seem to give everything away in a 30 second preview, I don't think I would have enjoyed the film as much.The movie touched my heart and as one reviewer said ""I began crying in within the first five minutes of the movie, and I'm not much of a crier."" Well, I certainly concur.This is a great movie for lovers, perhaps those going through a tough time in a relationship, or newlyweds. For children, however, they will most likely utter the words that my niece did, ""It's not funny."" If you have children that are easily entertained, patient, and can sit still through nearly any movie, take them along to watch with your significant other, if you can. Otherwise go with your partner, a close friend, or even yourself. I promise you'll be brought to tears, but they'll soon be wiped away as scenes become more comedic.Enjoy!","

"thelandofoo","25 January 2023","Up follows Carl Fredrickson, an old man who sets out to fulfill a promise he made to his wife as his world is being taken away from him. Right out of the gate, this film lets you know how special, heartfelt, and deep it is and makes you feel many things throughout. It's tearjerking moments are balanced out with colorful characters that relieve the viewer with clever humor, but even they have genuingly touching moments themselves. What Carl's journey represents is his way of dealing with grief and with grief, obsession is something that can easily slip into it and makes you forget what is truly important in life. Up is an incredible animated adventure film that, like others from Pixar's tenure, prove to be more than just for the children and is my favorite Pixar film (and that is saying a lot). Final verdict: 10/10.","

"gregeichelberger","25 May 2009","The one thing that has made Pixar Studios so successful in making high quality CGI films is not just the brilliant animation and the love and craftsmanship that go into each effort, it's those wonderful stories.While the kiddies can wallow in the vivid color spectrum, high energy action and such lovable characters as Sully, Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Nemo, Lightning McQueen and Wall-E, among others, their parents can relish the thoughtful and interesting plot lines.And, with the newest Pixar animated film coming out this weekend, both youngsters and elders can re-live the whole process all over again. ""Up"" is a multi-layered action/adventure/comedy/drama that goes for the laughs but slides just as easily into the other genres.And while the studio has grabbed the lion's share of animated movie Oscar awards, many these movies far outshine much of the live action garbage we're given year after year. In fact, in 2008, ""Wall*E"" was my second favorite film of the year, just behind ""The Dark Knight."" In ""Up,"" Carl Fredrikson (voiced by Ed Asner) is a bitter 78-year-old retired balloon salesman who has just lost his adventure loving wife. He lives alone in a small house no one in the neighborhood ever visits.But Carl does have one dream left – to visit Paradise Falls in South America. Of course, he does not have enough cash to accomplish the trip, so he sets about tying thousands of helium balloons to his domicile.On the very day he decides to embark, however, a fatherless Wilderness Explorer, Russell (John Nagai) just happens to be on his front porch. The story then arcs into pure fun and fantasy, but the growing relationship between the lonely senior and the young boy in need of a role model is not ignored.There is a lot of action in this film, but there is an equal amount of heart – and that's what sets it apart and makes it one of the best the studio has produced (and that is saying a whole lot).Especially wonderful is the short opening segment(mostly without audio, just like many parts of ""Wall*E"") which introduces us to Carl and his wife. If this is not a lump-in-your-throat moment, you're probably a heartless android.Now, I haven't even written about Pixar's crystal clear animation and seamless technology. There seems to be a different look and vibe with each film and ""Up"" is no exception. The characters are rather boxy and goofy, but that's fine and fits in well with this story.The scenes beyond the clouds are vivid, amazingly artistic and wondrous. The emotions run from frivolity to fright and back again. it is truly a roller coaster ride of emotion that leaves you tearful one moment and exultant the next.I almost did not want to leave the theater.And, of course, no Pixar picture would be complete without the opening short. In the past, we were introduced to rabbits and magicians, space aliens and gauntly but cute birds. This latest effort is entitled ""Partly Cloudy"" and is one of the best and funniest, so far.","

"liyinsu","18 November 2015","""UP"" is one of the most wonderful animated feature from Pixar, which included all of the emotions of sadness, heartfelt, funny, whimsical and adventurous which can bring you into tears. It begins with a romance as sweet and lovely as any I can recall in feature animation. Two children named Carl and Ellie meet and discover. They share the same dream of someday being explorers and following the entire marriage life, it began with the love from first sight to widowhood and continues with the amazing skyward journey to Paradise Falls. Finally, I love how this film really touching my heart and I cried every time I watch this movie. It's such a very deep emotional film that no one will ever miss.","

"MissSimonetta","1 July 2014","I roll my eyes every time someone claims the first fifteen minutes of this film are all it has going for it, that after the silent montage it's just a banal kids' film about talking dogs and giant birds. For me, the greatest moments of Up (2009) happen long after the montage, for its power does not come from those five minutes, but from Carl Fredericksen's emotional journey.Carl has lost his wife Ellie, whom he promised to one day take to Paradise Falls in South America. Life got in the way and he was never able to grant this wish during her lifetime. The whole film is about him getting past his guilt and grief, and learning to live again. The image of Carl dragging his floating house by the hose says everything about his inner state. Russell is not only there so the kids will have a character they can closely relate to; he's there to get Carl to come out and live again, to connect with people again. (He's also a lot like the young Ellie in terms of personality, just a touch less hyperactive.) To those who argue Muntz was a needless villain, I must also disagree. Muntz is a mirror image of Carl in that he is a bitter old man unable to let go of the past and live. Like Carl, he is a recluse, but to a much greater degree, and he is so disconnected from humanity that he sees every other person as a threat.Yes, the scene with the dogs flying the fighter planes is silly, but guess what fellas: this is not gritty realism. This is a film where a man can use balloons to make his house fly to South America. Are we really going to loose it over a Star Wars homage that lasts less than five minutes? I feel this was more of a defense than a review and I apologize for not going over the gorgeous and vibrant animation, and the score. But I think this is one of Pixar's most powerful films and it deserves every ounce of praise it gets, no matter what the haters say.","

"Polaris_DiB","25 July 2009","Pixar's first venture into 3D is just about everything you would expect of it. Beautiful, gorgeous, colorful, and all that and a story too. A story full of lovable characters, adventure, and a gruff ol' fart. Everybody loves gruff ol' farts, especially those that have hearts.Some stand-outish things: 1) Whoa. Dog character dialog that sounds exactly like how you'd imagine dogs think.2) Whoa. Animated blood. Pixar truly pulls no punches.3) Whoa. One of the saddest cartoon deaths since Mustafa went down in Lion King.4) Whoa. What a tear-inducing ending! 5) Whoa. That scene when he looks through the adventure album again and discovers something new hit ya right in the heart.Make no doubt about it, whether I have kids or not I'm saving all Pixar productions to be watched over and over again. Nobody I think in the history of cinema has had such regular and trustworthy output, especially for movies that are aimed at children.There is one thing. As their animation has gotten more and more detailed, the character's faces have started looking more and more marshmallowy and plastic, devoid of quite the amount of detail put into, for instance, the millions of leaves in the background. This time you get to see Carl's face get all scrubbly and patchy as he doesn't shave for a few days, but the kid still looks like a plastic lollipop. I'm worried that, although they've gotten to an almost unthinkable level of detail in movement and environment, that Pixar isn't much interested in putting more dynamism into the faces, which still move roughly the same way they have for several years now. This type of thing wouldn't even be noticeable if it wasn't for the constantly improving level of all of the rest of their work. That said, like always, this is merely a nit to pick and not something that it ruinous or damaging to the fun and heart-filled Pixar experience. They are still, as far as I'm concerned, reigning kings of quality CG children's animation.--PolarisDiB","

"yellowtail_tuna","9 September 2020","It is a very beautiful animation film where an exciting adventure is set in the sky. The old Mr. Fredricksen has his house floating by hanging from hundreds of balloons and set off to South America after depressed by the loss of his wife.The first sequence that shows his earlier life is moving. From the first meeting with the neighbor tomboy to the marriage life in the house to the time when she is getting weak, we see his entire life with his wife and get totally in his shoes.The main location is the jungle in South America where his wife had dreamed to visit. He happens to have three companions, a boy, a dog, and a snipe. The house also soon ceases to be accommodation and becomes a big floating companion itself, which he calls by his wife's name. The house's colorful balloons are very beautiful as if they show the house's emotion.The mountainous geography is fully exploited for the 3-dimensional cliff-hanger action, which involves physics where they and the house pull each other by a rope. They have to deal with the balance between the buoyancy from the house and their weight. Characters' movement is briskly and comically choreographed. The materials are realistic, one of the best is the dogs' hair.Honestly, I am not really into the story. Mr. Fredricksen's purpose is vague. And I'm not sure if the film really needs that evil villain. But at least I like the companion characters. Among them, the boy Russell has a soft and round body like a rubber ball. And just like his body, his nature is also sensitive and resilient. I can't help hoping he will become happy.","

"Quebec_Dragon","28 June 2009","Pixar does it again. I've watched almost every Pixar movie and it seems that despite the potentially least interesting, least commercial subject (an old guy flying away in his balloon-covered house), they just can't go wrong. It's another great film, exquisitely animated and downright beautiful to behold. What makes Pixar films, and ""Up"" in particular, so special? My theory is that beyond the amazing 3d computer graphics, it boils down to likable characterizations and heartwarming humanistic moralistic stories that don't consider their audiences stupid with a dash of good humor and a pinch of wonder added for good measure. Basically, Pixar films like ""Up"" usually have ""heart"" without feeling forced or fake. The life story of the old guy presented at the start was a wondrous touching piece of work accompanied only by beautiful evocative music. Actually the music in ""Up"" is noteworthy for its emotional effectiveness throughout. The story might appear a bit simple in hindsight but it works beautifully and touches on several universal themes and values such as grief, friendship and acceptance. It has its sad dramatic moments but overall it's quite fun, funny and dare I say uplifting. This coming from a guy who's usually allergic to ""feel good"" movies. It even has an underlying romantic background that makes everything more special.Why is it that Pixar movies, ""Up"" being the latest case, often have better acting than most live-action films? Is it because of slightly-exaggerated animated emotions, the top-notch voice-acting or the incredible facial expressions and body language? I do wonder how ""Up"" would keep the interest for younger children. The pace is sometimes intentionally slow (old guy being a bit slower) and it does have quieter introspective moments. Some places might be up over their head but I think the lovable enthusiastic bumbling boy scout and dog would certainly help keep their interest and it's likely they will be fascinated by the graphics and grumpy old guy. I think ""Up"" can appeal equally to adults and children alike and if the high praise from every corner hasn't convinced you yet, it's definitely worth watching and owning eventually. I certainly want to see it again. Grandparents in particular should see this with their grand kids, or even alone if they don't have any, as they might find it inspiring. My only exception to my high recommendation would be for those few who have disliked Pixar movies in the past. ""Up"" probably won't change their mind but then again why not give it a try anyway?

"dfranzen70","6 June 2009","When a slight misunderstanding threatens to force elderly Carl Fredrickson (Ed Asner) into a retirement home, the wiley old coot decides to go for broke, attaching thousands of balloons to his house and floating off to the jungle wilds of South America. Trouble is, a little kid named Russell (Jordan Nagai) is also along for the ride, which doesn’t quite play out the way Carl intends it to. This Disney/Pixar instaclassic is a lot of fun, especially in 3D, with charming, realistic characters, sweeping vistas, and a straight-arrow message that’s neither muddled nor heavyhanded.Now, you gotta know this upfront: I love 3D animated films. It’s not like the old days, where the makers would try so hard to make the 3D exciting and amazing that they forgot to make a movie behind the effects. What happens nowadays is that the creators write an awesome, fun movie and then toss dollops of 3D effects to accentuate the story, rather than distract from it. (Or, as sometimes would happen, detract from it.) So maybe I was an easy mark, but I thought Up was outstanding. Ed Asner, as the cranky old man who’s lost his zest for life, turns in a pitch-perfect performance that’s both endearing and curmudgeonly. Of course, the animation is so detailed that you can count the hairs on Carl’s chin as the days progress, but the Pixar gang did a great job in showing the various expressions on the faces of the human characters here, something I think they’ve been slow to develop well. (The toys in Toy Story, for example, looked great, but Sid the neighbor kid did not appear to be fully formed.) The story itself is an adventure on the order of Indiana Jones, if Indy were a septuagenarian with the physical prowess of an eggplant. The unlikely duo winds up in South America, all right, but they encounter more than just trees and rocks. Every animated film needs a villain, and here we get the luminous Christopher Plummer as a thought-dead old-time explorer who’s been holed up at the very spot Carl wishes to visit. Plummer does evil pretty well, I think, especially for a Canadian. (They’re kindly, peaceful folk, you see.) Compared with recent 3D movies, I’d put Up a little higher up than Monsters versus Aliens, but not much. The sweet ending, although expected, packs just as strong an emotional punch as it would if you couldn’t see it coming. And certainly the intended audience for this movie won’t care about nuances; the kids in the theater where I saw this raved about it, keeping in awed silence for much of the film - except when Big Fun Wonderful Things were happening, when they erupted with raucous jubilation.","

"estebangonzalez10","16 September 2010","Up is by far the best Pixar movie released to date, and one of the best movies of the year. This film has it all, a great story, interesting characters, a good soundtrack, and great visuals. I watched this in 3D but I think it would be just as good without it because what stands out here is the heartwarming story and the relationship between the old and grumpy Carl Fredricksen and the young boy scout Russell. This movie really grabbed me by surprise, I didn't expect it to be so good, especially after watching the trailers. I thought Carl was simply an animated version of Clint Eastwoods character in Gran Torino. But in this film we really feel for the characters, the character development in this film is just brilliant. There is a scene at the beginning of the movie where there is no dialogue but we all understand what is going on and it is one of the most heartwarming scenes. The film also has several funny moments so there is a nice balance. This is probably Pixars most serious film, but at the same time it is extremely funny. You think Carl is finally fulfilling his lifelong dream when he sets on a journey to South America, but at the end you realize he has already lived the adventure of his life. Sometimes we are so caught up with reaching our dreams that we miss the adventure of the moment. Enjoy the ride even though at first you had different goals and dreams! A powerful and touching story which at the same time combines some very funny moments (I loved how they played with the voice of the Doberman). This is one of those rare films that is much better than the trailer makes you expect it to be. I know it is a little early in the year but I expect this film to be nominated for best picture. Yes, it is that good.","

"TOMNEL","6 June 2009","Early reviews of Disney/Pixar's Up made some statements that I myself could not believe. The main charge in almost all the reviews was that the audience was crying within the first ten minutes. This seemed impossible to me, that an audience of people could become so emotionally involved in a film within ten minutes as to start crying...I was wrong. The opening to this film is heartbreaking, and possibly one of the saddest scenes to be featured in a film. And they pepper these little scenes throughout. This movie is very emotionally involving, and that's a good thing.Carl Fredrickson (In his old age, voiced by Ed Asner) at one time was a kid with dreams of being an adventurer, visiting strange and exotic lands. As a child, he met Ellie, the girl of his dreams, and he got married to her. They had a life together, tried to have a baby, and as life went on, the explorer dreams went farther and farther away. After Ellie's death, Carl has become a bitter old man. Now 78, all that Carl has left is his house, which construction workers want down. After an accident where Carl injures a man, Carl is forced into an old folks home, but he isn't going. Being a retired balloon salesman, Carl has plenty of balloons left, so he ties his house up and takes off for South America where he and his wife dreamed of going. Unfortunately for him, boy scout wilderness explorer Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) came along for the ride. Adventure and chaos ensues while trying to get his house to the exact spot in South America.This really is an excellent, if not almost perfect picture. The characters have such depth, as is true with most Pixar main characters. Carl is a mean old man, but he is definitely likable, and it's easy to see the motivation behind his anger and bitterness. Russell is another deep character, written to be the comic foil, and to be a cute little kid, and to be the child from a broken home who has problems. These characters contrast so perfectly and have excellent chemistry, and are just well written in themselves.In many ways this is a touching film. Lot's of character development is featured, mainly from Carl, but from others too. Carl is such a tragic hero, and all he wants to do is set his house down where he and his wife dreamed. Carl's wants and needs should click with anybody who has nostalgia and just wants to live their past. He's a broken man, trying to redeem himself, for himself and for the memory of his deceased wife. It's really a sad tale in itself, but with the normal Pixar magic, it's also an uplifting, funny, entertaining film that will definitely be remembered as a classic.Pixar has yet again raised their bar even higher. Up is a beautiful adventure film filled with rich characters, great animation and very real emotion. Possibly Pixar's best picture yet, and that's including the amazing Wall-E. Best picture thus far of 2009! My rating: **** out of ****. 99 mins. PG for some tragic scenes.","

"Jay_Exiomo","20 August 2009","Typical of Pixar's adeptness in conveying stories, the first few minutes of ""Up"" pack more wallop than a whole two-hour tearjerker could, as it charts Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) and childhood friend Ellie through the decades, from their role-playing days as intrepid travelers to their marriage, and eventually, Ellie's death. Pete Docter's animated tale is an elegant combination of humor and pathos that perfectly captures the rush brought about by adventure, the uplifting quality of friendship, and -- at once a reminder of Disney's ""Bambi"" and Pixar's refusal to compromise its narratives -- the pain of losing someone. It's a profundity that's both delicate and penetrating.78-year old Carl and his wife Ellie had kept a scrapbook of their planned adventures and always dreamed of going to the fictional Paradise Falls in Venezuela, where their childhood hero, the adventurer Muntz (Christopher Plummer), has famously traveled. For some reasons, the expedition doesn't materialize and Ellie soon dies, leaving Carl alone in the house, with the latter about to go to predatory land developers. Inadvertently bringing along the pudgy Wilderness Scout Russell (Jordan Nagai), Carl decides to fulfill Ellie's wish as he ties thousands of balloons to his house and floats to South America.Advertised as Pixar's first foray into 3D, ""Up""'s candy-colored palette and graceful portraits of Carl's house floating in the sky benefit from the additional visual depth, though the increasingly silly travails of Carl and his slapdash tour is filled with buoyant energy that keeps it from resting entirely on the technology's novelty. Centering on the theme of one's continual search for purpose, Carl learns of how holding to the past keeps him from reaching his destination and from setting off to new adventures, a moral that Docter fortunately doesn't overplay, but rather is represented in splendid visual metaphors. It may be too easy to call it an elevation to animation but there's no escaping the fact that, for all its jaunty adventures and affectionate regard to relationship, ""Up"" -- pardon the obvious description -- doesn't let down.","

"jdkraus","22 June 2009","I originally did not plan to see ""Up"" fearing that it would not be any good. Then again, Pixar has done well the last two years with ""Ratatouille"" and ""Walle"". For the heck with it, along with some friends, I went to see it last night. The theater was packed, specifically with parents and their little ones. From start to finish, there was hardly any noise in the theater, except for the constant laughter. What I'm saying is, is that ""Up"" delivers.What's nice about ""Up"" is that it is not only great for kids, but also for adults. I've been noticing lately that Pixar has been incorporating mature themes in their films. Without giving too much away about the plot, ""Up"" deals with things that every person encounters, the loss of a loved one, and the sense of helplessness it brings. Heavy subject matter, but it doesn't make the film too mature nor does it make it syrupy. The message the film delivers, the ability to go fulfill a childhood dream and go on an adventure, if even you think you've outgrown it is brilliant. Watching this movie made me feel like a little kid again. Well done. The voice talent is wonderful. I did not recognize many of the cast members' voices, which I think is a good thing, because a big celebrity like Eddie Murphy or Mike Myers can divert from the intended story. The animation isn't corny nor is it over the top like in ""Happy Feet."" Michael Giacchino's score adds a whole new level to the film. It helps propel the story. When the movie hits a sad moment, the music makes you want to cry. When it hits a suspenseful moment, it makes you want to grab onto the edge of your seat. Rarely do I give a perfect, but ""Up"" deserves one from me. Two Thumbs Way Up for Up! It makes you feel sad. Makes you feel exhilarated. Makes the time fly by. It makes you laugha lot.

"robehr101","30 May 2009","When I walked into the theater last night for the 9:15 showing of Up I had high expectations. I didn't go in with a half-hearted interest or mild confidence; I was expecting to see something amazing and I wasn't let down. ""Up"" flies as high as the House that becomes the premise of the film.I admit I was a bit distracted when the movie began; either no one knew the movie was starting or no one cared because they were being VERY loud. But as the movie played on the noise died down and I found myself charmed by an opening sequence that is so emotional that you'd hardly believe you were watching a children's movie. In fact, three fourths of the way through the sequence a younger woman sitting in front of me declared to her friends ""This movie is sad!"" in a voice that indicated she had not been expecting it. That being said this movie is still definitely suitable for little children and although I wouldn't go as far as to call it a children's film (I think pixar is beyond that) it has, as always when it comes to pixar, no course jokes or crude humor.As the movie progressed past the opening sequence, I almost expected to be let down by what came next; I wasn't. After a touching opening sequence that told the tale of his life, the character of Carl Fredrickson continues to be developed with such care that you can't help but feel sorry for him when the men Nursing Home comes to hall him away; even if he is a bit grumpy.Since I don't have time to go through the movie section by section (and you probably wouldn't have time to read it even if I did) I'll continue this review by highlighting my favorite bits and criticizing what little there is to criticize.The scene in which the house is sweeping through the clouds as a storm rages around is truly incredible; the action is actually intense and you don't feel like your watching a happy fairytale in which the characters would never get hurt or die. In general, the action was that way throughout the film. There was one point somewhere between the touching storytelling, the witty script and the epic action that I literally forgot the movie was animated and that has arguably never happened to me before.The biggest downfall of the movie, in my opinion, were the evil talking dogs. I found Dug to be the only talking dog that really came across effectively; the other ""evil"" dogs had little to no character development, were not memorable at all and were not threatening in the slightest. When they climbed into airplanes to shoot at Russell I found myself rolling my eyes in disbelief; dog's flying airplanes? This small downfall, however, is not near enough to ruin the movie in any way.Another slight downfall (and I'm not sure if I'd really call this a downfall) is that I would have liked a bit more of a sense of wonder and discovery when Carl and Russell first arrived at Paradise Falls; perhaps they could have discovered a few interesting creatures (besides Kevin) or strange plants. Ultimately I don't think they would have had time for this which is probably why it wasn't there but it would have been nice addition.As you can probably already tell, my overall opinion on this film is VERY positive; although a bit more of time would have made the film a bit more interesting and well-rounded, in the end, it is not needed and the film still comes across as charming and even epic without it.","

"rlnutt","30 May 2009","My wife and I didn't know if we were going to see this Pixar/Disney film because it just didn't look all that interesting to me in the movie trailer... I was wrong! The movie is darker than any other Pixar movie and it has a more adult theme... keep that in mind if you are planning on bringing your children! The villain is VERY bad and the way they ended his character in the movie was not appropriate for children under 10! In fact, my wife and I were wondering why they didn't portray his character having an epiphany and turning back to good.All in all a very good movie, never drags and the story is quite sweet... but don't forget it is dark and mean at times and that could make it difficult for small children!","

"griffolyon12","31 May 2009","Up is another piece of true artistry from Pixar. It's the story of an old man named Carl, who has become a grumpy old man after the death of his wife. When he is threatened with the possibility of being put into a retirement home, Carl attaches hundreds of balloons to his house and the house takes flight into the sky. Carl begins to steer the house towards his and his wife's childhood dream, Paradise Falls in South America, where he plans to live out the rest of his life.Up truly is an excellent piece of film-making; it resonates more so than just about any other film in the Pixar catalogue. Here director Pete Docter has tailored a film that will both make the audience laugh, and cry. Though the film finds its strength in its themes. With this film Pixar has dared to deal with some very heavy themes, such as growing old and one's childhood heroes not always being what we want them to be. The themes are expertly handled by Docter, never feeling heavy-handed, but it is Docter's amazing ability to let the emotion of a scene to play out is what makes this film a true stand out above many other recent animated films. Now this should not fool one into thinking that Up is not a great film for the children as well, because it is.Up is first and foremost an amazing adventure film. It's action packed, filled to the brim with pulse pounding action sequence after another. Another one of Up's strong suits is its comedy. It is quite possibly the funniest film Pixar has ever made, a large part to due with the wonderful cast of characters within this film. You grow to love Carl Frederickson and the rag-tag crew that follows him. Of course what makes Up a film for the ages is its sheer imagination. No other film in recent memory has sweeped me away into its world quite as well as Up has. The film's world is unique, endlessly filled with original idea after original idea. Who would have ever thought of a house flying through the air, or making a 78 year old man the hero of an adventure story? The guys at Pixar did and it paid off big-time.Once it is all said and done Up is one of the finer films of the year, and definitely stands amongst Pixar's best (but is there really a worst). While it is sold as a children's film, many adults may find themselves enjoying this film more than their kids, thanks to its often serious subject matter. Though children will love the films flat-out hilarity and its high octane adventure. Up is a true masterpiece.I give Up a perfect 10 out of 10!","

"annasanches","19 January 2022","Perhaps ""Up!"" - is the only cartoon I'm ready to watch over and over again.For almost 10 years now, I've been enjoying this wonderful Pixar creation, feeling sad for the characters, rejoicing at their achievements, and always crying in the finale from happiness.The story of how two lonely people (an old widower Carl and a fat scout Russell) found each other and together found the joy of life touches me to the core.It's hard to open up to the world after losing your closest loved one, but you have to continue your adventure, live in the present and become someone you truly need.The great quality of the cartoon, the wonderful voiceover (Armen Jigarkhanyan), the reverent, kind, positive and instructive content did their job - ""Up"" is the best thing I've ever seen.If you haven't seen it, be sure to watch it, you won't be indifferent.","

"jora_dyn","29 May 2009","I went into this film amazingly enough knowing absolutely nothing about it except that it was Pixar's newest release, that it was 3D, and of course that it was called UP. I have to say Pixar tops itself again. As a fan of traditional 2D animation, 3D animated films have always been a rough pill to swallow. Even if I really like them I still have a twinge of despair that they are in the 3D medium. I don't want to say that I am completely transformed and now love 3D, but Pixar always does a great job in lessening that pain.I found Up to be a very heartwarming film. We got a glimpse of Pixar trying to play with the heartstrings in Wall-E, but they definitely have some far more emotional moments in Up. But with the great laughs and story included. I found it to be a fantastic ride that will have you almost in tears one minute and then laughing out loud the next. Great story. Great voice actor. And great Animation. Well done Pixar.If anyone could get a stubborn old traditionalist like me to enjoy a 3D film, it's you...","

"owen-watts","22 September 2022","Everyone knows about the opening to this film and no matter how emotionally prepared for it you are it still hits you like a massive truck. What I wasn't expecting was just how funny Up is. There's this tremendous dry wit to it that had gone way over my head the last time I saw it, which was when it came out (and in 3D, mind you) what feels like a billion years years ago. Even though it starts getting into ""half an hour this pensioner could barely move and now he's basically superman"" territory I never felt I minded that much. That opening, those gags, that artistry. It's classical Pixar and it's utterly mesmerising.","

"MartianOctocretr5","19 July 2009","The opening sequence is the most powerfully emotional image in a long time; for any genre of movie, let alone an animated family film. It does bring a tear to the eye, and may be too sad and intense for children to take. Taken at its intent to show a once happy man's loneliness as a foundation for the story line that follows or taken as too strong a message will probably determine if you like this movie or not.I did. The central character, Carl, is a very likable guy, and can be sympathized with immediately. The boy scout kid represents what Carl feels he has lost, and the adventure is his effort to reclaim it. There's a great feeling of freedom and escape when the house zooms out to the sky, and an eagerness to see things along with this good man as he embarks on his journey.It's a great ride, both literally and figuratively. The visions of the animators of what the world looks like from this unlikely dirigible is authentic, beautiful, and inspiring. Colors are used vigorously and with astonishing precision. The overall look of the film is simply wonderful. The enormous Grand Canyon like precipices in Carl's South American Shangri La type destination almost appear as a dream scape. One example of the creative imagination in the movie is when the hero carries a giant object along, strapped to his chest--I hope I get to do that one day.As for characters, most are fun although not always essential. The dogs and their human-like gifting is the stuff of great humor. The mythical creature was a nice touch. My only criticism of the movie would be the choice of villain. Someone who should have been a fast friend for Carl since they think the same way is depicted as vengeful, bitter, and vicious. It was too pessimistic a choice; a longer look would have provided a more logical bad guy.In summary, some visions are very strong emotionally, but the final product is another fun and exhilarating triumph for Pixar.","

"rsa5387","12 June 2009","While I didn't find this nearly as impressive as Ratatouille or Wall-E, Up was still a quality Pixar product, and a creative, if slightly pandering animated film. The animation, as to be expected, was stunning. The character design and ballooning portions of the film were exceptionally crafted. The story, however, was lacking. The first 30 minutes were perfect, exuding a level of maturity I didn't expect from a Pixar film. With minimal dialogue, the expressive cinematography was emotionally effective, reminiscent of the best moments in the nearly silent Wall E. The summation of Carl's life with his wife was absolutely beautiful. It is truly one of Pixar's finest moments, and one of the best scenes of 2009 thus far. Once Carl's journey got underway, however, the film took on a far younger sophistication, with cutesy side-characters and inane slapstick moments thrown in to keep younger audiences awake. Kevin the bird was especially annoying. On the other hand, the dogs were hilarious and creatively crafted, garnering some of the best moments in the film. Overall, I thought UP was an enjoyable, if somewhat underwhelming film that could have been so much more if it didn't noticeably pander to younger audiences. Even so, Pixar's heart is always in the right place.","

"markymnstr","5 June 2009","I'm sure for the handful of people that read this I'm going to probably get a 0 out of 12 found this review helpful. It seems, almost without exception that positive reviews are deemed helpful but negative ones are not.With that said, I felt this was one of the most disappointing, if not the most disappointing Pixar film yet. The story was obviously pieced together almost as an after thought. It was flawed, and at times preposterous.First, what I liked. The opening 15 minutes. When the young boy and girl met, fell in love, grew old together, and then...well then the rest of the movie happens. Also, very much enjoyed the little boy scout character.Again, a spoiler alert is called for here. In the opening scene, Carl Frederickson, the 78 year old hero of the story, is a little boy watching a newsreel in a movie theater of his hero, an intrepid adventurer who travels the world in his airship (blimp). Jump forward seventy years later and our 78 year old hero runs into his hero, at least thirty years his senior and the hero looks and acts like a man in his late 50s or early 60s. I mean, Please! Then, the dogs. Oh yes, those cutified, electronic collar talking dogs. Are you kidding me? Who came up with that idea? Ugh!!! We know the idea of ""Up"" came from the Japanese masterpiece ""Howl's Moving Castle."" But how that could have a rating on IMDb of 8.1 and ""Up"" a rating of 9.1 just boggles this person's mind.","

"mauricepfeife","21 February 2017","I remember seeing this movie as a kid in theaters. I was like 8 or 9. I didn't think it was an awful movie, but it (kinda) didn't makes me feel something, I just didn't get the point. Yesterday I buy this movie thinking maybe it was too deep or more for adults. And I was kind of right. I think kids can enjoy this movie, but adults too, and maybe even more than kids. I love all the metaphors (House represents what Ellie is for Carl), the music and the animation (even though I sometimes feel like they didn't nailed the balloons). In general, the first half was like a 4,5/5, truly brilliant. But the second half, I thought didn't gave that brilliance of the first half. It felt so fast, kind of messy and the action didn't worked for me. And the fact that Muntz dies, makes Carl kind of the bad one, like he doesn't care about that death, it doesn't even bothers him. Anyway, that half doesn't makes the movie a bad one. Its an 3,5/5 half. Still deep, great message (I would summarize like this: Love is amazing but you still have to do your own thing. What would you say?) and I don't know much about that stuff, but I think I can say it has a great character arc. Not a brilliant movie, but a veeery good one.","

"oneguyrambling","30 October 2010","No one company has given me as much movie enjoyment over the last 14 years. No actor, director or studio has me anxiously awaiting even the announcement of the next project as Pixar.Pixar value story over pop culture references and winking at the screen, genuine charm and consistency over simple cuteness and syrup, and establishing character over crass marketing ploys (probably ""Cars"" aside).If you like any Pixar film read no further, there is no letdown here. Go watch Up.It doesn't even matter if you have kids or not, Up is just a great movie. I for one have watched every Pixar release since Toy Story in 95, which was of course the first, and as my son is still too young to go to a cinema I went to Up kid-free. Don't be snobbish adults, you'll miss out on some great flicks.If you are still uncertain here is what Up is about.We open with a star struck little kid, maybe 7? at the ""moving pictures"" in what might be the 40s or 50s, watching a news piece on the rise to prominence, and subsequent fall from grace of explorer Charles Muntz.On the way home, still on a giddy high from his 40s fanboy experience, the boy runs into a similarly aged young girl, also an exploring enthusiast named Ellie. Carl and Eddie are polar opposites, Carl seems quiet, shy and introverted, Ellie is loud, opinionated and outgoing. They grow up, get married and plan ambitious exploring missions.Now comes the most moving dialogue-free few minutes that I have experienced in a film for perhaps ever. A simple slowly paced montage shows Carl and Ellie and how they grow together through life.Realistically this is the kind of step that can only be pulled off by an animated movie, but this few minutes is amazingly effective. In it we learn more than we could have discovered in a totally separate 90 minute film about the same characters.One key point from the montage is that despite their best efforts, Carl and Ellie are never able to save enough for their trips before the funds are needed elsewhere - ultimately Carl is left alone. No sappy last words, no clumsy togetherness, just a lifetime summarized in minutes.10 minutes in, and I'm genuinely sad.Carl is now 70 something, think Clint Eastwood in ""Gran Torino"" without the forced everyone is racist – but that's sometimes OK clumsiness. He lives in the same home that he and Ellie shared, and now it more than anything is the embodiment of his deceased wife and their happy life together. Therefore, while progress is altering all around him he stubbornly refuses to move with the times.One day a knock at the door introduces us to Russell, a Wilderness Explorer (Boy Scout). Russell is looking at adding to his hefty collection of merit badges by helping the elderly.Russell is a typical 10 year old kid – well meaning, book smart about topics a 10 year old should be (animals and such), especially Wilderness Explorers but unaware of how much of real life actually is. He says 10 year old dumb things because he doesn't yet know any better, Russell is just a boy growing up.Carl is a crotchety old man, and when he does change it is only subtle and for legitimate reasons.Back to the film, Carl shoos Russell off with a wild goose (snipe?) chase, and goes back to his lonely existence.After a run in with developers, Carl is told that he has run out of time and must move to a retirement home, and two men show at his door to take him there.Now anyone who has seen even the poster knows what happens next, so there should be no surprise at how he leaves, but when it dies happen it was a spectacular event, both visually and cinematically, and it carried a real sense of something actually happening, not just a plot device.I had all over tingles for minutes. Good ones.As luck would have it Russell has come back to visit and has inadvertently stowed away with Carl on his journey to fulfil Ellie's wish and Carl's promise.Russell appears Asian-American (to be PC), and it is refreshing to see Asian-American animated actors getting more work, as up until now the animated landscape has been dominated by white, black, green and blue characters.Carl and Russell (well really Russell) befriend an 8 foot tall South American bird while ""walking the house"" the final stretch to Paradise Falls and the bird, who Russell names Kevin becomes quite protective of him.Yep I said Walking the House.I'll go spoiler free from here, Up is a film that earns the right to unravel in front of the audience.Once in Paradise Falls they meet more characters, not all human - but still capable of communicating. ""SQUIRREL!"" There is a very effective chase scene, house included, and a finale that makes Carl the most geriatric Indiana Jones type character since, well Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.Being an animated film involving a man floating his house to another continent and his subsequent adventures of course the plot includes ludicrous events and situations, none seem truly out of place. Up remains amazingly entertaining and deserves repeated viewings.One final point, there are a few situations where Carl and Russell and various animals are put in danger, so younger children may be a bit distressed at times (OK parent hat off).Final Rating – 9 / 10. There is nothing more certain than the fact that I will be watching this many times in years to come. Loved it.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com","

"manikhero","28 July 2009","The movie was totally Fun and Awesome. The graphics of this movie was superb and awesome. Especially, Russel was very funny and his voice was also funny. Charles Muntz was perfect for the villain role. I liked the idea what Carl did to float his house in the air to reach the Paradise Falls. When, Carl was a boy, that time he was so cute and funny. When, The dogs are chasing Kevin, Russell and Carl, that scene was superb and Awesome. Even, the last scene was cool and superb. When, the house gets A storm attack, that scene was cool. Charles Muntz's dogs are awesome and superb. His cave was dark and it was cool. I should really appreciate the creators of ""Up"".","

"bobsgrock","3 June 2009","Yet again, and why are we still surprised at this?, Pixar has dazzled and amazed all of us who believe that movies have the ability to rise above mediocrity and simple-mindedness no matter what genre. Gradually, these genius computer animators have grown more mature in their writing, bringing alive characters that perhaps kids would like but adults would almost certainly love. It seemingly started with Ratatouille, but these elements were evident even in Finding Nemo or The Incredibles. Here, it all comes together in an incredible array of sparkling animation and vivid storytelling that will show audiences once again that Pixar has a monopoly on animated films.There are sequences done here that no other studio would dare touch, much less for an animated movie (consider the silent sequence depicting Carl and Ellie's life together). But, Pixar is so far above the average and ordinary, they dare to dream and tell the story in a way so different and more effective. Our hero here is Carl Fredrickson, a 78-year old retired balloon salesman who has lost his wife of many years and is feeling the effects of pressure on elderly people by the world. He decides to pay tribute to his wife by attaching thousands of balloons to his house and float away to Paradise Falls, a secret place in South America he and his wife vowed to go to one day. However, things happen, such as an ambitious 8-year old boy scout trying to earn his final badge stows away and they find a giant, exotic bird named Kevin, and a dog that can talk named Dug. The more I think about this story, the more I like it. For my taste, it doesn't reach the magical levels of Wall-E, Ratatouille, or the the original classic Toy Story, but it pulverizes movies made for the pop culture crowd like the Shrek movies, Ice Age, and Monsters vs. Aliens.Perhaps the biggest asset to Pixar is Disney, which gives them a seemingly unlimited amount of resources to create worlds that are wondrous to experience. Every single one of their movies are at the top of computer animation for that time and this is no exception. The color palette which director Pete Docter is working with exceeds all levels of imagination and makes for a glorious adventure. And the characters are likable as well as not likable at some points along the way. A mixture of mirth and fantasy, Up is an adventure like no other. Kids may like it, adults will love it. And as for Pixar, there is only one direction for them to go and that would be... up.","

"Pilsung89","8 November 2009","I don't understand why this movie is so popular. I really don't. I find it to be an average animated flick. Nothing stands out to me or really appeals to me in the movie. I don't the characters very interesting or memorable. The story is not played out very well at all. the voice acting is good, but nothing special. There were actually quite a few times the characters only annoyed me. I'm not calling the movie bad, but in no way do I consider it amazing. It's just very average to me, on both an entertainment scale and a cinematic scale. this definitely does not compare to animated classics such as The Lion King or Aladdin. It's definitely suitable for young children, though and they will probably enjoy watching it. So if you're looking for a family film to watch with the kids, this movie is for you.","

"badajoz-1","25 October 2009","The opening twenty minutes were quite touching (the famous sequence of boy growing through life and losing his true love/wife), but after that it just went downhill. How far Pixar have plummeted since 'Toy Story?'!!!!! The story is just a bit of fantasy of young and old trying to live out a dream in exotic setting, where danger lurks in form of batty old explorer and his many dogs! Gosh, what originality and what a plodding plot, characters, and empty subsidiary characters!! Yes, you just sit there while old Walt works the sentimentality line he did in the forties and fifties, only with modern animation, eg fat Americans who eat chocolate! Sorry I could not enjoy it more, but you suckered me into the cinema (only £3 each admittedly) and gave me a tired rerun of a lot of other Disney rubbish with superficial modernisms. And please can we really not have that cliché of how the real American Dream of family, apple pie and redemption is just around the block? Does every US film have to make Americans love themselves with no criticism - after all the villain is voiced by a Canadian!","

"pilotom","31 May 2009","I own every Pixar film on DVD but I have to say that UP may be the first one I pass on. I was very excited about seeing the film today after reading several good reviews. I think now that perhaps some reviewers out there are letting the Pixar reputation get to them. I can't believe ANYONE would say this is one of the best films of the year. Films like MONSTERS, INC, FINDING NEMO, WALL-E and TOY STORY deserved accolades like that but UP doesn't have the heart those classics did. The film is at its best early on when the characters aren't talking much. We see a montage of the lead character's life as a young Carl meets an exuberant girl named Ellie. We see them marry, live a life together, experience the highs and lows of life and finally, we see Carl loose his beloved Ellie and become a widower living alone in the house that always was their home. This sequence is moving and made me think that Pixar was about to strike another home run. However, at this point the characters start talking more and the story starts to get a bit...much. Carl decides to tie a bunch of helium balloons to his house in order to fly the house off to South America on the adventure he and Ellie were never able to complete together. He unwillingly takes along a young boy scout stand-in (Russell) who ends up on Carl's porch when the house takes off. Russell is determined to earn the patch for helping the elderly required by his troop in order to graduate to senior status. The balloon premise is a bit far-fetched but since it's an animated film, you go with it. However, once in South America, things get progressively weirder. Carl and Russell end up walking through the jungle and mountains with the house strapped to them, floating above. I think I knew the film was NOT going to be the usual classic I was used to from Pixar when they come across a bunch of talking dogs. It seems Pixar, whose done films about animals who can talk and done films just about humans, wanted to mix the two so they write into the story these dogs with collars that allow us to hear their thoughts. The dogs belong to an old adventurer living in the area who is determined to capture a big, ostrich-like bird to prove he's not the fake the world judge him to be decades ago when he claimed the bird existed. The adventurer has hundreds of dogs and not only do they search the jungles for the elusive bird, they also cook for their master, serve meals AND fly planes. Very weird. I think if you're going to make a film about smart, talking animals - make a film about smart talking animals (FINDING NEMO) and if you're going to do a film about humans, do one like THE INCREDIBLES about humans. In UP Pixar tries to mix the two and it just doesn't work. The ONE character who I thought had the most heart and was most interesting, was Kevin, the big bird who doesn't talk, seems devoted to her young and takes an instant liking to the human boy who probably reminds her of her babies. I heard kids in the audience more than once asking what was going on because they couldn't quite understand the story. I suspect UP will not be one of those films kids will watch over and over again like they do with the other Pixar classics. Pixar has some incredibly talented people but in UP I think they spent too much time on ""cool"" ideas and not as much time on developing the story and characters into something we could care about and believe in.","

"the_one_only_original_me","30 May 2009","For starters, I would like to apologize for the summary description I gave this film (I couldn't resist the chance to use a pun). Now that I've said that, lets cut to the chase; Up is your average Pixar movie...and if you're not familiar enough with Pixar then you should be informed that the average Pixar movie has 1) excellent voice acting. 2)cutting edge animation. 3)great story and script. and 4) heart.In other words, Up is slam dunk of a family movie. The plot is about the misadventures and adventures of an old man named Carl Fredriechson and a tag along boy scout. But there's more! If you want to know the rest, then go see the movie.Like all Pixar movies, the voice cast is spot on. All of Up's characters are brought to life with well read lines, vocally emotional undertones, and an assortment of talents. Pixar's trademark CGI animation also breathes life into the characters, all of them are given convincing facial animations and gestures which could match any Hollywood A-lister's.All of the CGI (which is everything seen in the movie) is done beautifully. The scenery is breathtaking and the jungle sets sometimes look as if they were ripped from an issue of National Geographic. Pixar's signature animation is always cartoonish, yet photo-realistic and of course, ahead of their competition.What's also impressive about Pixar is that they never underestimate the power of story. Up's story is original enough (talking dogs and a house held afloat by balloons aren't even the half of it) but it isn't just about the physical conflict and events. It is really the story of an old man trying to find redemption in the twilight of his life by fulfilling an unrealized dream. Pixar has mastered the art of throwing tragedy and warmth into the same basket without becoming too heavy handed, and you can feel it in this movie. Up is also exciting and fun. The sense of adventure is palpable and the humor is charming. The script is also nicely written and clever. This movie is also very, very family friendly, despite its PG rating.The bottom line is that Up is beautiful, touching, humorous, charming and kid and parent friendly. It is just another grade A Pixar movie. Which means that unless your inner child is completely dead you should see it!","

However, as we grow up and lose, we are also experiencing the sweet and bitter life of life. We are also told by people around us: there will be thorns under the blue sky and white clouds, and there will be all kinds of maliciousness in the smile.
This is the ideal world of utopia that we dare not think about. But in fact, life can be insipid, knowing one person, loving that person, staying with that person, staying together until the death separates the two. What a wonderful thing.
In the film, Carl and Ellie's time is always sweet and indifferent: build a house of love together, go to a picnic together, watch the sun rise and fall, and the ordinary lens is very warm.","

"inkblot11","3 June 2009","Karl (voiced by Ed Asner) met and married the girl next door, Ellie. Ellie was an extroverted adventurer while Karl was a shy, reserved person but their friendship and marriage lasted a lifetime. It was Ellie's dream to follow in the footsteps of a famous world traveler, Charles (Christopher Plummer) and make her way, someday, to Paradise Falls in Venezuela. Over the years, however, Karl and Ellie, a childless couple had many home and life realities to deal with and they never made it to South America. Now, Ellie has died and Karl is forlorn. Not only that, developers want their Victorian house, the last holdout in an urban neighborhood, to be razed to make way for high rise buildings. They almost get their wish. But, at the last moment, Karl attaches a fleet of balloons to his house, lifting it in the air, and steers a course for Paradise Falls. But, wait, there's more. A talkative, tweenage scout, Russell (Jordan Nagai), who had convinced Karl to help the young lad earn a merit badge for helping the elderly, has stowed away under the house's porch and is, thus, a fellow passenger in Karl's house-airship. At first, Karl is annoyed but after they land in Venezuela, not on target, Russell helps Karl begin to move the household toward the falls. The two also encounter a trained army of dogs, who obey the commands of their long-lost-to-the-world master, Charles the explorer, who has been trying to capture an elusive, large, colorful bird, new to the known world. It seems Karl and Russell are definitely putting a spanner into his plans. What will be the outcome? This is an extremely wonderful family film, highly entertaining and very, very touching. The story is ingenious, with a flowing action that will keep everyone riveted and the animation is amazing, especially in 3-D. But, added to that mix, is a beautifully moving tale of true love, friendship, and loyalty. This viewer was in tears several times and would dare to say most others will do the same. As the voice of Karl, Asner is excellent, his gruffness hiding a caring soul. Nagai is also topnotch, very funny and very sweet as the young, lonely boy. Plummer, too, does a fine job as the ""heavy"" of the movie and the lesser characters are absolutely perfect, too. In fact, this is a rarity among films, in that it is almost totally without any flaws whatsoever. If you can only see ONE film this year, make it this one. It is UP at the top, and will remain so, of the list of films for 2009.","

"jburtroald95","27 September 2009","When Pixar first introduced the concept of purely computer-generated feature films, little did they know that they had created a ravaging ravenous monster that only they – and DreamWorks – would be able to tame. Forgetting that Pixar's philosophy has always been that you should always take time and care when working with this technique and that storyline was absolutely paramount, other companies gave in to the temptation to exploit the revolution and whip up several second-rate CGI flicks that were so enticingly easy and inexpensive to make.Computer animation has almost driven quality children's animation to extinction. It has been the death of cartoons, and the decline of claymation. Though the two aforementioned animation giants have thankfully managed to continue producing such wonderful specimens as 'Toy Story' (1995) and 'Shrek' (2001). The last fourteen years have taught us that only these two companies can manage to get it right, that only they can tame the monster.Now Pixar's offerings did falter after 2004, but they regained their footing last year with Wall-E and have sustained that success with Up, an exhilarating yet also deeply moving film. It tells the story of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Jeremy Leary at the beginning, but mostly by an amazing Edward Asner) a man who dreamed of adventure as a boy, a passion that saw him meeting and later marrying the sweet Ellie (voiced quite well by Ellie Docter, the director's daughter). The two share a long and beautiful marriage in a cosy little house that the couple decorated together, but after many years Ellie dies in hospital next to a very broken-hearted Carl. Though after her death Carl holds on relentlessly to their house and all of his photos and memories of her, he also goes on to attempt to fulfil her childhood dream which was to have a house in a lost land in South America.The story of his marriage is told quickly and with little dialogue, though still with much grace and emotion. This is of course so the exciting adventure he embarks on – which involves him taking off in a house tied to a million balloons – can be given most of the screen time, as it is more of a crowd-pleaser. Though the winsome themes are not forgone at that point, and more depth and more fun arrive when we are introduced to young ""wilderness explorer"" Russell (voiced perfectly by Jordan Nagai) a naive and extremely animated boy who ends up tagging along to assist the elderly Carl.There is also a villain thrown in – perhaps unnecessarily, though he does give us a fair bit of enjoyment and is a major supplier of the story's complications – with his own story that is first mentioned and begun to be told at the beginning, and waits in the wings until near the end where he reappears and starts being nasty to the two heroes. He is explorer Charles Muntz (voiced splendidly by Christopher Plummer) who surprisingly is Carl's childhood hero, a ruthless tyrant obsessed with hunting down, killing, and taking back the strange bird-like creature that stalks these lands in order to prove he has seen it and has made it to the lost land.Remembering its genre, it is a remarkable achievement and one that reassures us that Pixar is still the best. It even manages to surpass Wall-E, which very visibly tried too hard to incorporate meaningful messages and to be a masterpiece. Although it succeeded, it didn't do so anywhere near as naturally and effortlessly as Up did.","

"classicsoncall","19 October 2017","I'm not particularly a fan of animated movies, but once settled in I can generally find them entertaining and worthwhile. The same can be said for ""Up"", the tale of an old widower curmudgeon who inadvertently hijacks a stowaway on his sky-bound home as it lifts off for a lifelong destination called Paradise Falls. The film is colorfully rendered, and if you're a guy who once might have been involved in Scouting at any level, you'll get a kick out of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner) sending his young hitchhiker Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) on a hopeless snipe hunt. When these things occur, I find myself in the underdog's corner, and when Russell finds a snipe and names him Kevin, the adventure really gets under way. It's too bad Carl's childhood hero turned out to be a villain, but that sets up the challenge of saving his new found friends from a diabolical, mad scientist, and find a way to get back home. Oh yeah, can't forget the cute canine pal along for the ride as well. His name is Dug, and is sort of the comedy relief character along with Kevin, and has a big hand (paw?) in making the save for the intrepid travelers. For it's efforts, ""Up"" won a Best Animated Feature Film at the Oscars in 2010 against some worthy contenders. In it's own way, the film has something for young and old alike, and if you're feeling down for any reason at all, you might even find it up-lifting.","

Again and again they release entertaining movies with not only a terrific sense of humor, but a level of storytelling that has set a standard for today's films, animated or otherwise. While I was obviously extremely excited to see Up, never did I expect it - or, to be honest. Well, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Simply put, Up is a perfect movie.This movie is freakin' hilarious. Without a doubt the funniest film that Pixar has ever made, each and every character in Up provides their own bit of humor. Dug the dog (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson) is especially hilarious every single time that he ""opens his mouth"" I love Up. Go see it now.","

"jboothmillard","22 October 2009","This was the tenth feature created by Walt Disney Pictures studios and Pixar sounded like it had simple concept, but it is done so beautifully that you can feel yourself in the story. Basically, young Carl Fredricksen (Jeremy Leary) loved the idea of exploring, and his hero was the great Charles Muntz (The Sound of Music's Christopher Plummer), and he one day meets fellow exploring enthusiast Ellie (Elie Docter). They grow and marry each other, and over the years they try to achieve their dream of travelling to the Lost Land in South America, but many things stop them, and the dream disappears completely after the sad death of Ellie. Carl (Edward Asner, voice in hundreds of cartoons) is now lonely and grumpy, but still remembers the promise he made to his wife, it is only when he hits a construction worker forcing him to move out to a retirement home that this may actually happen. Before the men can take Carl with them, a huge cover unveils thousands of helium balloons that manage to lift the whole house away, with directional wings to take Carl to South America. He is inadvertently accompanied by a young stowaway, eight-year-old scout Russell (Jordan Nagai) trying to earn his last assisting the elderly badge. After encountering a storm and nearly getting lost they manage to land safely on a cliff of South America's Lost Land, and tying the house to themselves they start walking to find the spot above the large waterfall. On the way they are joined by a rare colourful flightless bird, probably the ""snipe"", that Russell names Kevin, and a talking (with a translator) dog named Dug (Bob Peterson). While walking Carl meets his childhood hero, Charles Muntz, missing for many years trying to find the rare bird that he has to become evil over to catch. There is the point where Carl wants to be alone, determined to fulfil his promise to Ellie, but he finds the adventure book is more full than he originally thought. So he plucks up the courage to go after Russell, the bird and Dug and stop the nasty Muntz from succeeding, in the end he even manages to let his house go, attend Rusell's badge receiving reception, and get a new and I guess better house. Also starring Delroy Lindo as Beta, Jerome Ranft as Gamma and Pixar regular John Ratzenberger as Construction Foreman Tom. The montage near the beginning of Carl and Ellie together with music by Michael Giacchino is beautiful, the film is full of extravagant colour, and all the characters make this a wonderful heart-warming story that makes you believe your never to old to follow your heart and your dreams (sounds corny I know, but it's true). It may be aimed a little more at adults, but with plenty of stuff for the younger generation too, it is a visually astonishing, funny, moving, and imaginative, essential animated viewing. It won the Oscars for Best Music, Original Score for Michael Giacchino, and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Sound Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film, and Best Music, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film for Best Original Score. Outstanding!","

"Groverdox","20 September 2021","I had high hopes for ""Up"". I don't think it let me down. Maybe I let it down. I don't know.I think the secret to Pixar's success is that they knew before anyone else that a great children's movie is a great movie, full stop. You don't have to transparently attempt to please both children and adults: this was what was wrong with a lot of terrible family movies, like ""North"". Adult humour seems stunningly out of place in a movie best enjoyed by children, and the truisms children might be hearing for the first time are often ones that adults can do with being reminded of.At least, that's what I always thought. ""Up"" starts very well, with an opening montage that makes everybody's list of saddest movie scenes. When the central premise of the flying house suspended by balloons is established, we realise the movie is off to a great start, but where it goes from there just isn't as interesting, and it lost me repeatedly.Maybe I'll watch it again later, now that I know what to expect, and hopefully I'll be able to replace this review with a more positive one.","

"geniuskentyk-1","9 July 2010","Pixar always makes amazing films, like Wall-e, Ratatouille, or The Incredibles. The ones that aren't amazing are usually pretty decent, like Cars or A Bugs Life. Finding Nemo has always been my favorite because of how great the story was, the beauty presented in the movie, and the variety of characters it had. Up has two of the three things Finding Nemo has – Beautiful scenery and a wonderful story. Up's story isn't as smart or complex as Ratatouille or Finding Nemo, but it's still entertaining and fun. Up doesn't have that many characters, but it is Pixar's most emotional movie to date.The first ten minutes of Up will make you want to cry. It sure made me want to give up my god-like manliness. Those that don't give in to Up's emotional beginning don't have a heart. I like how the story isn't all about Carl (the old guy) and his sad story. The movie sheds some light on the other lead's (the little kid, Russel, who accompanies Carl. He also happens to be Asian!!) background. Carl is mourning his wife, while the film briefly explains Russel's issues with his father.Although there wasn't a variety of characters in the movie, there was still a whole bunch of dogs, a colorful bird, and another old dude, who happens to be the villain. The dog, if you've seen the trailer, is Dug. Dug is a very cute, playful, and loyal dog, who appears to be a Lab. Kevin is a beautiful female prehistoric bird that the other old guy, Charles, is searching for. The movie is fun because it offers so many laughs from the four characters of Carl, Russel, Kevin, and Dug. Charles, however, is a different story.Charles Muntz is Carl's childhood hero. He's a famous explorer that, about 70 years ago, discovered the bones of some kind of bird that no one has every seen before (we, the audience, know that it's Kevin's race). Scientists claim that Charles made up everything, so Charles swore that he would find a living specimen. This is where Kevin comes in. Charles spent the rest of his life trying to capture Kevin, and when Russel and Carl grow fond of Kevin, the two parties are at an opposition. Now, Carl finds his childhood hero trying to kill him.I respected Charles and his character in the movie, but I soon grew intolerant of him. I understand that he spent his life trying to capture Kevin, and it's his passion. However, Charles becomes an asshole to the other characters when they get in his way. Charles even endangers a little 7-year-old boy, Russel, just to get what he wants. By the end of the movie, I felt that Charles got what he deserved.Up is the best film I have seen all year, and is the only movie so far of 2009 that I've given a 10 out of 10. I can't think of any animated movie, or live-action, that has been as emotional, sad, funny, and charming as Up has been. I also loved the animated short film that appeared before Up, called Partly Cloudy. I liked how the short film kind of has a similar setting as Up, and I think that Partly Cloudy has a story that Pixar could actually make into a feature film. One think that disappointed me at the theater, though, was the fact that the trailer for Toy Story 3 wasn't shown. Every Pixar movie has a teaser trailer of the next movie that's going to be released, so I kind of felt cheated. Even though I saw the trailer for it already, I still would have liked to see it on the big screen, and also for everyone else in the theater to know about it.","

"itamarscomix","26 September 2011","Pixar seems to be improving from one film to the next. From The Incredibles onward, they've been set on making their films more and more appealing to adults, and they've done it - Up can be enjoyed by the entire family - more so that Wall-E, which was too slow paced in its first half for children.The feelings of melancholy and nostalgia in Up, especially the opening montage, are authentic and truly touching; which doesn't mean that Up is not also incredibly funny. The second half is a romp of an adventure movie with lots of action and lots of fun; it's not as powerful as the beginning, but it's also not a letdown like the second half of Wall-E. Whether it's melancholy or insane, Up remains consistently good throughout, and it's one of the best CGI features made yet.","

"Dr_Coulardeau","9 August 2009","Walt Disney has done better animated films in the past. This one is rather average. But it is important because it shows a radical change in the targeted audience. The concept of family audience has completely changed. The kids are no longer accompanied by their parents but by their grand-parents. So the film targets these grand-parents as a potential audience and is built on two main characters, the child and the senior citizen. The whole film is based on this crossing over three generations. Then the film is also aiming at a younger audience that is living in decomposed more than recomposed families and the child is thus living with his father and another woman than his mother, and he is systematically betrayed, in spite of what he mat say, by his father. The boy scouts are shown as particularly father-centered if not male-chauvinistic by not allowing a boy to be supported by another person than his father when receiving medals in some ritual ceremony, the father or another fatherly man, but not the mother. A very long tradition with Walt Disney: their support of the family structure like with Ebenezer Scrooge in the famous Christmas Carol, or of course Snow White and Cinderella. Fathers are not particularly enhanced and step mothers are frankly demonized. The animals of the film are not essential, just some kind of mirror in which children will be able to recognize their phantasms and dreams. But this film is absolutely Anglo-Saxon and based on a myth from this culture and this culture only, or nearly, and particularly the English branch of that myth and culture, the Lost World of Conan Doyle, the belief in the existence of a pocket or virginal nature surviving behind un-crossable mountains that can only be reached by air with a blimp or a flying house. It is thus normal to have some paradise cataract and a bird of paradise, a giant one mind you, and of course this bird will have three chicks, a trinity that is there to sanctify this virginal world, this garden of Eden. At a time when Jules Verne was looking for adventures that contained a great quantity of danger, Conan Doyle was dreaming of the rediscovery of the garden of Eden. Charles Muntz has little to do with Captain Nemo. In fact he has no humanity at all, not even the good sense to forget about, and forgive, the dumbness of human beings. He is ready to kill a child and destroy a bird of paradise and doom its – her actually – chicks to perdition for his own vanity. It is these particularities that make the film interesting, but it does not have the finesse and the subtlety of Ratatouille. The allusions to American culture are numerous but it would be fastidious to give them all, like the small house surrounded by high rise buildings (Death of a Salesman). These allusions are aimed at the adult and elderly audience of course. But I can't resist asking one final question: is the Shady Oaks retirement home covering some shady business or some shaky eugenic mentality concerning the elderly?

"blanche-2","19 January 2010","Pixar's ""Up"" is a colorful animation adventure film about the journey of a 78-year-old man to make a long-cherished dream come true. Carl Fredricksen ties balloons to his home and takes off for South America so that he can land his house on some obscure falls. However, he soon learns that an 8-year-old wilderness scout who was trying to assist the elderly so he could get a badge was on the premises when the house took off.This is one of the sweetest films imaginable, reminiscent in the beginning of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" - a young boy has dreams of travel, marries his childhood friend; the couple takes on the refurbishment of an old house and finds that life gets in the way of their travel ambitions. Later on, the film becomes a real adventure story, with talking dogs, exotic birds, and a crazed explorer. Fredericksen looks like Spencer Tracy and has the voice of Ed Asner; the explorer, a childhood hero of Fredericksen's, looks like Kirk Douglas and has the voice of Christopher Plummer. All of the voices are delightful.I don't generally care for animated films, but I was swept away by warmth and heart of this one, not to mention its magnificent detail and beauty. It has a lot to say about love, the generations helping one another, and following your dreams. A real winner.","

"JackCerf","8 June 2009","When asked if Disney's Pocahontas was historically accurate, one critic replied, ""It's got a talking raccoon, for God's sake."" So here. Old Man Fredrikson lifts his house off the ground with thousands of toy balloons. An 8 year old with a GPS navigates the house to South America, steering with a coffee grinder attached to two shower curtains. When they get there, Fredriksen meets his childhood hero from the 1930s, who is still upright and vigorous, albeit embittered and paranoid, at age 100+. Just go with the fantasy, talking dog collars and all. There's always plenty going on in a Pixar film.I'll skip over the love story, which stands out, to a couple of less conspicuous points. I loved the dogs, who spoke what we'd like to think are dog thoughts. And anyone who thinks they lowered the tone of the movie should consider the wide range of dog behavior that Pixar left out and most animation studios would have wallowed in.I also loved the contrasts between the 8 year olds: Carl and Ellie delighted with a few found objects and their imaginations, and Russell laden with every piece of gear money could buy. And the contrast between the two views of nature: Muntz, wanting to catch it and put it in a museum Teddy Roosevelt style, and Russell wanting to leave it in place. The manly hero of 70 years ago has soured into a fascistic bully by modern standards. The politics are a lot more subtle than The Incredibles or Wall-E, but they're in there just the same.","

"paulclaassen","10 June 2020","Although I love animated movies, I somehow did not enjoy 'Up' as much the first time I watched it. Years later, I decided to watch it again. I admit to enjoying it more the second time around, but I still have mixed feelings about this one.The film begins (and ends, as it turns out) with such a sweet, yet sad story. We all have dreams when we're young and carefree, but when reality steps in, some of these dreams are brushed off as fantasies and we loose the enthusiasm to pursue our dreams. 'Up' depicts this to perfection, and I can certainly relate.The film then becomes a charming little fantasy adventure. I enjoyed the difference of opinion between the 78-year old hero, Carl, and the adventurer kid, who - as it turns out - was not quite as adventurous as he believed he was. The adventure element is exciting, although not in the least remotely realistic. Then again, this is a fantasy. They meet a lot of interesting characters along the way and despite numerous obstacles, Carl's determination is never doused.There's a lot to admire here, and I believe the film sends out a strong message. Maybe I'll watch it again after a few years, and who knows, might enjoy it even more then...","

"literarycherub","30 May 2009","It was a good movie, but not great. The beginning sequence was well-done, tender, and sweet, but it was not quite as emotionally affecting as I expected. I would have liked to see a couple more scenes of Carl and Ellie interacting with dialog because the scenes with them as kids didn't quite cut it for me...I liked how it set up Carl's instantaneous love for Ellie, foreshadowing the endurance of his love for her, but her character came off as unique (which was good) but also kind of annoying. If we got to see a little more of her character and dynamic with Carl, maybe a scene of her showing some love for him, I think the following music-only sequence and the whole movie would have been more emotionally compelling.Anyway, Carl as a character was a good protagonist, not the stereotypical, grumpy old man one might expect but instead a quiet, relatable human being. Russel, on the other hand, wasn't the best counterpart for Carl; he had some good moments, but was overall pretty typical and annoying at parts.And while I liked Kevin and Dug, I didn't care for their introduction and their plots. The fact that a giant bird, a pack of talking dogs, and a crazy old man comprise a large part of the story doesn't sit well with me, especially since the movie at first seemed to be rooted in realism (a balloon-propelled house isn't entirely realistic, of course, but it is not cartoonish like the aforementioned elements are).I would have overall preferred if the movie kept a sense of realism to it; there are plenty of ways to have adventures without all that hyper-cartoonish stuff. Even Muntz was a bit cartoonish for such a movie. However, while I would have liked the movie better without these unrealistic plots, they ended up working pretty well once the real point of them as a new adventure for Carl--an adventure to bring him and Russel together in a strong way and for a common good--was more firmly established and explored. However, this purpose still could have been accomplished in a less cartoonish way.As for humor, I didn't find many of the jokes to be funny. Maybe a couple were, but overall, it was kind of weak on humor. Several gags were predictable, and even those that were decent weren't great. I also think the writers thought Russel was a lot funnier than he actually was. And as for the emotion, there were some lines and scenes that seemed forced (for example, Russel's stories about his father), but there were other scenes that got the emotion just right; it worked best when it was understated and subtle.My favorite scene in the movie was when Carl looked through Ellie's ""Adventure Book"" and saw the photos of their enduring marriage inside with the final note of ""Thanks for the adventure. Now have a new one!"" A very simple yet powerful scene, in my opinion. And while I found the ending to be very predictable and the scene with the badge lacked the emotional impact it wanted to have, I did like the final scene of Carl and Russel eating ice cream and counting cars (unfortunately, it was the first time I felt a real bond between the characters.) Anyway, the end credits were really great too, very nicely summing up the whole message of the film...one of my favorite parts of the whole movie, actually. And this message of everyday life being an adventure when spent with someone you love was really nice, one of the best things about the movie.Technically speaking, the visuals were pretty great. I saw it in 3D, and it utilized the 3D well without overdoing it. The only thing that bothered me a little was that parts of Carl looked strange...his ears and hands mainly. But overall, really nice-looking movie. Oh, and the music (particularly the old-fashioned piano music) was awesome.In précis, probably worthy of a B/B-. Tentative grade, but there it is. Didn't reach the heights of emotion and beauty of ""Wall-E""; didn't as successfully accomplish the feeling of friendship and fun like ""Toy Story"" did, but still a fairly solid Pixar film.","

"JimD73","2 June 2009","Pixar has never disappointed (so long as we block Cars from our memory). After Wall-E, the bar was set higher than ever. Wall-E was a beautiful haunting picture, made not for children but more for people willing to absorb the imagery without needing to be guided by dialogue. Despite the success of Wall-E, I think Pixar realized how it may have alienated children to some extent with its long first act, and has included more colour and dialogue in their next picture, Up. However, even if a slightly less mature picture at times than its predecessor, Up ranks among the best Pixar films to date and may actually be its most haunting.Up is the story of 78-year old widower Carl Frederickson. After the death of his wife, he finally decides to do what they always dreamed of doing and having a house on Paradise Falls. However, when his houseship has an unexpected passenger in young boy scout (sorry, ""Wilderness Explorer"") Russell, his journey becomes something else entirely.Carl is probably the most tragic character Pixar has ever made, possibly even including Wall-E. The opening montage of his life is probably the single most tragic thing I've ever seen in an animated feature. Even Russell, the requisite annoying-yet-noble child, has his share of tragedy surrounding him, also dealing with themes much more mature than the standard studio. It's a tale of a man trying to live his life in its twilight, and its done wonderfully.Of course, no kids want to see a tragedy, so importantly, Up is very funny. There's a man with an army of talking dogs, from which much humour ensues (particularly from Dug, the ""SQUIRREL!"" dog from the trailer, as well as Alpha, a Rottweiler with a malfunctioning collar). Then there's the large-bird-thing Kevin, also producing some very funny material. Despite the tragedy of the whole story, you really can't help but be entertained, and certainly this is a very funny movie.I do have my complaints, however. The climax seems too stereotypical, a pitfall of all kids movies. It works, however, even if it doesn't blow away. Also, as a physics major, I have some issues to settle with the mechanics of walking around dragging a flying house, but its a pure fantasy movie, and eventually i coerced my brain into shutting up in that respect.One final note: the 3D aspect. I did see it in 3D, and was very impressed. Unlike most 3D movies, there was not a single ""OMG 3D"" moment in Up (forgive the expression). The use was subtle, yet did add a degree of immersion to the film. It also made the dogs that much more frightening at times. The movie definitely is very good in 2D, but the 3D gives it an extra layer, even if not necessary. If the idea does make you queasy, go for the 2D, because the 3D does not drive the soul of the film.Overall, Up is a triumph. Pixar seems more focused than ever with these last few films, and I'm absolutely loving it. If this implies that Toy Story 3 will be the best yet, bring it on.NOTE: There's a 3D Toy Story 3 trailer attached. That makes it worth admission alone.NOTE: The short film before the movie (as standard with Pixar) is not their best, but its very cute and works its magic to warm you up for the film.","

"morphricky","14 July 2012","I give one star for the fantastic animation and voice-acting. This movie is indeed very beautiful to look at and the voices fit the characters.Unfortunately, there's an overwhelmingly bad about this movie, hence the low score. Bad Advertising - This movie-poster and trailers give the impression that this is a lighthearted and fun movie. Colorful balloons, funny looking bird, bright lit sky. The back of the DVD even says it's a fun-filled adventure full of laughter. What we get is a very depressing, sad, boring, frightening and mean-spirited movie with the occasional attempt at a funny scene that lasts a second or two. The only thing that had me giggle was the bird and the scene where the old man imagines dropping the kid from the house.Lack of plot - I agree with other reviewers, it seems that they had a great idea and once they get to their destination this movie hits the drain. Instead of the goofy bird, we get dogs that can talk with collars (I thought they were creepy) and a maniac who wants to kill the main characters to capture the goofy bird. Was this at all in the advertisement or back of the DVD? Nope. And what's up with the adventurer and his age? He looks younger than Carl, but should be about 30 years older. And why wouldn't a collar that makes dogs talk and able to understand humans not be more interesting to show than that goofy bird? Heck, even a collar that makes dogs understand human emotions as well? Nope, only goofy birds are good enough for scientists.Depressing - The characters aren't likable (except the bird) and there's a lot of violence, sad moments, scary moments... I also thought it was very unneeded with the aggressive dogs. The moment where Kevin is caught in the net and taken away from her babies was also depressing. This whole movie is a huge downer. I don't mind depressing animated movies if they are done well. ""The Land Before Time"" is an excellent movie which faced many difficult things, but had enough humor and charm to balance it. This movie also started with killing off the funniest character, Ellie, by having her grow up into an old lady and die of cancer. Now that set me up in a bad mood from the very start.This isn't a movie I would want to watch again. I could barely make it through the last 30 minutes of the movie. The ending was disappointing and predictable.","

"judywalker2","31 May 2009","I saw Up today and I've been waiting for it to come out. But sadly I thought I would enjoy it more than I really did. It started out great. I agree with most of the critics that the montage showing the two lovers growing together and the loss of the wife was really something akin to the ""When she loved me"" scene in Toy Story 2. And the end of the movie was very touching but in between it was predictable and I have to say very boring. Needless to say the animation was, well PIXAR, can't say anything bad about it. The colors were brilliant and the characters lifelike as usual. But the last two movies made by PIXAR were more for adults than kids. My grandson was bored with this movie and WALL-E especially after all of the popcorn was gone.","

"Mr_Sensitive","21 June 2009","Yes, another movie from Pixar!!! That name alone is a quality assurance. Though I must admit that I didn’t quite find this movie any improvement from their previous, but it is still very much fun to watch and enjoy myself.The story is brilliant as always - really moving and humorous. And who could forget that 5 minutes montages, visually explain the story of Carl’s life without words. This time around the Pixar decide to take a little turn as we look as life itself rather than other point of view like their previous film – Toys, Bugs, Monsters, and so on. But they still managed to keep all the charm by adding such a lovable character to talking dogs, and colourful birds.Anyway the story is beautiful, only problem was at the time I have already seen most of the funny stuff in the trailer; so many of the stuff didn’t come much of a surprise to me. The flow of the movie is just great and with Russell (Little scout) around, everything is so lively and very much cute!! Also his stoutness and little beady eyes, added to the cuteness. There is a pretty good chemistry between almost every character. Though, despite all the praise I have for the movie (maybe a little bias) I still the movie lack one thing that really woos me. I’m not sure what it is? Maybe it was set in the ‘60s, or did I find the colour a little old and not colourful enough, or the backdrop was just plain and almost empty - I’m not sure.But overall I’m sure I will like it a whole lot better after a while and re-watch it. I’m pretty much sure about that!!! And the kids will absolutely love it.Season to Watch: It’s Pixar!!! Russell is really a lovable character.Reason Not To: Personal Dislike of animated film.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)","

"lee_eisenberg","6 June 2010","Now here's an unusual movie. Pete Docter's ""Up"" portrays elderly Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner) attaching balloons to his house and sailing it to a South American waterfall and finding even more than he bargained for. I've never been a fan of Disney, but this one had some out-of-the-ordinary stuff (for a Disney movie, that is), namely when Carl scornfully calls someone a hippie. As far as I can tell, the major theme is the completion of long-standing promises - Carl's deceased wife had long dreamed of going to the waterfall - and Carl's return from the brink of total senility.All in all, ""Up"" is not my favorite movie, but worth seeing. Also starring Christopher Plummer, Jordan Nagai, Bob Peterson, and John Ratzenberger, and even former ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member Laraine Newman in a supporting role.Squirrels can be a problem. My parents recently installed bird feeders, and the squirrels always try to get into them.","

"schmidteren","8 December 2013","Magical. That is the first word that comes to mind when describing this movie. The movie has so many life lessons put into one, but none of them feel forced or are repeated so you start to feel sick. It has the perfect balance of action, everything just melts together and fits together. The mood and the storytelling, how it IS a animation, so over the top things works brilliant, the art direction supports this. I teared up several times during the film, already after few min, and I think you will to. The pacing is brilliant, big concluding finale, nothing really overstays it's welcome. It has a lot of funny, clever jokes. It just puts a big smile onto your face, while also touching you in deep places, and with stuff we all think off. We want to do this, we want to do that. I know I do, forget to live in the now. Get over the past, it only does one thing, and that is hold you down, which this movie literally shows time again. Each time he makes bad decisions because of the past, the house gets lower and lower and harder to carry. It's just a fantastic movie, I've seen more movies then I can count, and I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Everything blends together perfectly, I couldn't find a bad thing, even if I tried very hard. Thanks for reading this, I hope you enjoyed the movie just as much as I did. And have a great day!Just some notes I wrote down quickly when watching it, ill just put them here in the end, if anyone would be interested. Important moment. Instead of trying to save what is already living ""Kevin"" A new partner/friend, he is still to bound by his past, his old love.Whenever he makes bad calls he stumbles, and drags, everything is a chore (I don't care about my writings being perfectly written, I do no corrections etc. I hope you can live with that, I myself prefer the raw stuff. When everything is too sterile, it's just boring to read. Errors is what gives personality to you, and to your writing.)","

"dekadent","30 May 2009","yes, this review contains tons of spoilers, so if you read it - you probably won't want to see the movie.. UP has been peddled to us by Pixar studio and many critics as Pixar's ""funniest cartoon ever"", well, some add ""arguably"" to this sentence, which did not make it any less misleading.. don't get me wrong, i love Pixar and all the masterpieces they gave us over the years, which only adds to my surprise and disappointment over UP - such a professional and famous studio either consciously joined other dishonest movie factories in an effort to advertise their product falsely, or for some unknown reason no one at Pixar understands what they created..and now - this is the movie in a nutshell (and a million spoilers, so you may want stop reading right here):1. boy meets girl, they both are mad about famous explorer and dream of traveling to some south American land ""lost in time"" discovered by this guy, who actually disappears from public view being ridiculed by scientists who do not believe the skeleton of an unknown bird he found is real.. well, boy marries girl..2. in 5 silent minutes narrated by the music Pixar geniuses show us the life of this cute couple, from happy marriage to the moment they discover she can't have kids (or was it a miscarriage you tried to show us in this happy funny movie, Pixar guys ?) to two of them getting old to her dying from cancer (or what was it that killed her, Pixar friends ?) and him being stuck in the same house, which is now surrounded on all sides by new high-rises, while some developers looking like men in black try to squeeze the poor old guy out of his house and his piece of land.. i'll be honest, the short story of their life ending with wife's' death brought me to tears.. and i was going to see a funny cartoon..also, as we're shown this couple spent all their life in the same house, and husband never achieved anything beyond the position of balloon vendor in a local park.. what the hell ? 3. old dude is visited by an overweight inapt boy scout who wants to help him in any way to earn ""help elderly"" badge..4. old man is fed up, he attacks one of the construction workers, court rules he has to vacate the house, and right when two indifferent dudes from assisted living place come to pick him up he fills up thousands of balloons he has from his job with gas and launches his whole house into aerial adventure.. let me also say that throughout the whole movie he constantly looks at the pictures of his deceased wife and talks to her, which is very painful to watch..5. Fat boy scout somehow jumps aboard the house, and is stuck there with old man...6. they arrive to south America by means of huge storm..7. miraculously they find themselves almost at the very spot old man dreamed reaching all his life.. they meet a weird talking dog (she usesspecial translating electronic collar) and a huge weird bird..8. they travel together trying to land the house at the designated water fall, while we find out that this dog is one of many ""talking dogs"" raised and put in servitude by the famous explorer, who is still, for like 60 years hiding with his huge blimp in a cave in the vicinity somewhere, trying to catch this rare bird, yes the very bird that old man and fat boy scout befriended.. old man meets explorer (who is apparently 150 years old at this point, but looks as ""young"" as old man), soon they figure out that Mr. explorer is cold-blooded killer who is ready to dispatch of anyone standing between him and the bird, and an ""indiana jones"" type sequence of events transpires before our eyes, during which the meanest talking dogs and Mr. evil explorer plunge to their deaths, old man looses the house, but comes in possession of the blimp and everything on it, as well as the army of remaining talking dogs..good adventure, terrific graphics, but...could this cartoon be any more sad ? and did i mention that poor fat boy scout lives with stepmother and abandoned by his real dad ? i don't know about you, but i wish there was a law that would let me sue a movie studio for false and misleading advertising..if i knew how depressing UP is - i'd never gone to see it..yes, there is ton of ""funny"" stuff in this movie, the interaction of old man and boy scout and talking dog and huge bird, and every character's graphics is funny and cartoonish, but none of this joyful ha-ha stuff manages to even remotely disguise the extremely sad plot lines..old man is heartbroken about his wife the entire movie, the whole balloon journey is about fulfilling her dream of getting to this south American place (why they never tried to get there in their 60 years together is beyond understanding, particularly given that they did not have any kids to look after (we were explained that all too well)), the boy scout is heartbroken about his dad leaving him, the bird gets injured by evil dogs (though recovers later), the famous explorer reveals himself as a homicidal maniac, and so forth...yes, as a story about the unlikely friendship, helping friends, fulfilling dreams and other crap like this - this cartoon is great..but as an ""arguably"" the funniest Pixar work it fails so miserably, so breathtakingly and profoundly that i am nothing but sorry i saw it..in no way it is for kids, and adults should know how heartbreaking the whole thing is..Pixar, why ?","

"Eumenides_0","25 August 2009","It's become a tradition for me to go watch the latest Pixar movie when it comes out. This studio is the only one I trust enough to always blindly go to their movies. There's no greater cinematic injustice than wait for the DVD.Movies like Up keep rewarding me for such loyalty. In this movie, we meet Carl Fredricksen, a 78-year-old man who decides to fulfill a pledge he made to his wife when they were still children: to visit South America. Their lives pass by in bliss, but without their dreams of adventure fulfilled; but when she dies and Carl faces loneliness he comes up with the most hilarious plan to make his dreams come true: he ties thousands of balloons to his house and just flies away.By chance he receives an unwelcome guest: Russell, a 7-year-old boyscout trying to earn an elderly assistance' badge. Although the boy is initially an annoyance to the grouchy Carl, eventually the two become great friends and teach each other valuable lessons.Like every Pixar movie, the story and characters are the main draw of the movie. Sure, the animation is spectacular, but which mega-studio can't get the same animation Pixar can? On the other hand, the screenplays Pixar comes up with are always simple but beautiful, not to mention excellent at visual storytelling. Wall-E was practically a silent movie; and even if there's quite a lot of chit-chat in Up, it's the ability to express ideas and feelings in images, which can be comprehended by children and adults alike, that make it so fascinating and heartbreaking.","

"3xHCCH","30 August 2009","When I saw the preview months ago, I knew this latest Pixar offering should really be seen in 3D for the best effect. However, upon watching, I feel that the best feature of this 5-star film is not really the 3D animation, it is the heart upon which the heartwarming story of Carl and Ellie Frederickson is so firmly based.From the trailer, I already knew this would not be the typical Disney-Pixar film. First of all, the lead character is a cantankerous elderly guy! I was really curious how this story would flow. And true to Pixar's amazing record of film-making, ""Up"" belongs up there with the best of them.That wordless montage on the evolution of the relationship between Carl and his wife Ellie from childhood to old age was beautiful and very touching. Maybe kids will not get affected, but certainly adults will be hard-pressed to hold back their tears in these few minutes that start of the film.The ""spirit of adventure"" upon which the love affair of Carl and Ellie was founded was finally realized when Carl was pushed to the wall by modern developments around their house. Carl had no other recourse but to go for broke and bring their house to the edge of Paradise Falls in Venezuela, as Ellie always dreamed since her childhood. He did this in the most original way, only possible in an animated film like this.The relationships Carl builds with his unwitting stowaway boy scout Russell, and later the strange bird Kevin and talking dog Doug, were slow to build up. But again, in true Pixar fashion, the power of true friendships shines through adversities encountered. Great story-telling indeed. This is a movie truly for all ages to enjoy. Do not miss it! The 3D is not essential for you to fall in love with it.","

"asda-man","4 January 2013","You might think that from my summary that I hate Pixar films. The opposite is actually true, I love Pixar films, they're wildly original and inventive with brilliant, unforgettable characters and a narrative with heart. I've not seen a bad Pixar film yet (although I haven't seen Cars). I've been wanting to see Up for a very long time and finally my little (well actually, incredibly tall) blonde friend decided to buy it for me this Christmas in Blu-ray no less (he spares no expense!) and what do I find, after I had expectations as high as Carl's floating house? I find probably the best Pixar film ever! It's probably even the best animated film I've ever seen too. Up ticks every single box and more. It has a genius original plot, sensational characters, a huge heart, is absolutely hilarious and is also incredibly entertaining whilst balancing all of these things.Up starts with one of the most touching flashback and montage sequences've ever seen. I can't think of a film that gets you teary in the first 5 minutes, but Up manages it. Whilst it didn't squeeze out a very small man tear, it did undeniably move me and also completely engage me into this old man's super sweet life. The character of Carl is so beautifully realised, as he clings onto the past and never having the chance to have a child, his only lasting aspiration is to go to Paradise Falls, where he promised to take his wife (Ellie) all those years ago. The trouble is that Ellie has now sort of become the house and so that obviously has to tag along too.The image of the house floating off into the sky has already and rightly become iconic. It's a bizarre, yet weirdly awe-some sight and could be symbolism for getting away from a crazy world (like the escapism you get from watching Up!). Now, Carl isn't entirely flawless, he has a temper and there's this rather deep scene where Carl has to go to court after causing someone a head injury! He was also not very nice to a cute and hilarious boy, who happens to be a stowaway on Carl's house. However, of course by the end of this epic journey Carl begins to realise the greatest adventure of all is having a child, or a surrogate grand-child in this case. It's enough to produce tears and chills, seeing such an odd couple become so close.The look of the film is nothing short of breath-taking. I saw Up in blu-ray and it's probably the best blu-ray I've ever seen and is right up there with The Dark Knight! It looks crisper than a Walker's factory and helps to show off the film's incredibly vibrant colours and imagination. The animation has such depth and detail, and the scope is so huge you can't help but feel transported to another world. And whilst the film can be wonderfully surreal (talking dogs flying aeroplanes anyone?) it never loses sight of its plot and characters. Now the characters are nothing short of genius. Dug the dog is an absolute hoot, and Kevin the bird is just as hilarious. Dug actually speaks like how you'd imagine a dog to speak, it's brilliant! The relationships between the colourful characters are also nothing short of touching and engaging. The theme of protecting nature is much more involving and less patronising than Avatar's attempt at conveying the message. The screenplay is full of wit and endless imagination which helps Up to become an instant classic. I was riveted by the grand chase scenes and profoundly moved by the slower, more character-driven scenes.Up is the full package. It's a highly engaging and hilarious animation with a fantastic sense of adventure. The wonderful directing and screenplay will have you hooked on one of the greatest animated adventures ever filmed. It's perfect for children but also offers so much more for adults, as it boldly explores some heart-wrenching ideas and touching relationships. By the end of it I felt as uplifted as Carl's house! It's a tale for our times, a wonderful feat of the imagination and a refreshingly original tale. Pixar's out done itself again, but Up will be preposterously difficult to beat. Do yourself a favour and watch Up on blu-ray!","

"judiciary","6 June 2009","UP is not what I expected, and that is not good. The production values were excellent and the characters even seem to be well developed. However, when the film was about 2/3 finished I totally lost interest. So did my grandson who I took along to see it! (I allow for the fact that the film was not aimed at retired old men!) Others have pointed out the plot holes and nonsensical features (dogs talking through electronic collars? Why not just give them voices? After all, it is a cartoon!) But I think the thing that lost me was the total absence of purpose. One reviewer philosophized that the movie teaches the importance of dedication to a task, even if it takes your whole life. Well, I suppose it suggests that, but the same point could have been presented with a much more interesting plot. I had thought my 5 year old grandson, at least, would enjoy another PIXAR popcorn-ball of fluff. Instead, I think he really only enjoyed the popcorn I bought for him.","

"ennieday09","3 June 2009","I saw this today with my friends and i wanted to watch Sam Raimi's Drag Me To Hell instead but my friends talked me into seeing this, and boy was i glad they did. Pixar has delivered some timeless classics like Toy Story, Monsters Inc. Finding Nemo, and the most recent Wall-E but this one has to be by far my favorite. Walking into the theater i was expecting a typical kids movie with a couple of laughs, crazy scenarios and funny characters but i got much MUCH more than that. The short film Party-cloudy couldn't have been a more appropriate warm up of what was to come in this movie because that short film had me tearing a little. The first 5 minutes of this story gave me such a nostalgic feeling of when i saw Bambi as a kid couldn't help but cry. The start of the movie had me moved with having Carl and his friend Ellie venture into the start of their lives and the close and unconditional love they shared for each-other. An amazing and almost too perfect couple put in a Disney film you think they could never have such a tragic event happen to this couple. But sadly, the animators of Pixar leave you bawling with this tear-jerker. The simple things about this intro really got to me like how they showed when they were kids and Ellie flew a balloon with a paper attached to it into Carl's room and Carl did the same thing to her when she was in the hospital. After his wife died, your heart sinks and you think to yourself how can i watch the rest of this movie after witnessing such a depressing moment? The scene afterwards with the bulldozers almost crushing his mailbox with their handprints on it and then wacking the guy in the head was almost hard to watch. But of course Pixar pulls it off again and takes the audience on a surreal adventure with great witticisms and characters. Russell's character was well portrayed and brought a lot of comedy and a great companion to Mr. Fredrickson. The dog 'Dug' brought a lot of great humor to the film and lines that had me laughing out of my chair at times. And the character of Charles Muntz, Carl's once childhood hero and now enemy was a great addition to the plot. All in all, this movie defines what real family movie is. It is literally for any age out there and you will enjoy it no matter where, when or who you are watching it with. A movie like Up will be frozen in the Pixar vault for a long time and other movies to come will have to be greatly designed to beat this classic. 10/10 easily","

"moviemanMA","5 June 2009","Up is everything you could ask for in a animation film and more. This is Disney/Pixar's first film in 3D. I have been a bit wary about the use of this technology, but I can't deny that it looks breathtaking here. There are no cheap effects and it is only used to make the film look better, giving it more depth and character. It's not just eye candy and it doesn't take away from the story.The story follows Carl Frederickson, an elderly man who has had a dream for most of his life to fly to South America to see Paradise Falls, the place where his favorite explorer, Charles Muntz, last visited. When life pushes him to the limit, he decides to take matters into his own hands. Being a Balloon salesman, he transforms his house into an air ship, tying on hundreds if not thousands of balloons to life him above the landscape and off to Paradise Falls. Unfortunately for him but fortunately for us, he has a tag along. Russell is a young Wilderness Explorer (like a Boy Scout) who happens upon his house just as he lifts off. The two are stuck together until they reach the falls.Along the way we encounter a strange bird of paradise Russell calls Kevin as well as a dog named Dug who has a collar that allows him to talk. All distractions and annoyances for Carl but friends to Russell.This is a wonderful story that makes you truly happy when it's all over. I thought WALL-E had some deep and profound messages like staying ""green"" and the dangers of obesity, but Up talks about fertility, life and death, companionship, fatherhood, as well as the generic loyalty, the importance of friendship, and having fun.Like all Pixar films (especially lately), there is always one aspect of the animation that is constantly being tested and glorified. In Finding Nemo we see how the water effects the objects in it as well as the light. Ratatouille showed how fog and shadows can create mood. Monster's Inc. focused a lot of attention on texture and interacting with the environment (like Sully's fur). In Up we get a lot of depth perception and panoramic views thanks to the 3D technology. There are times when I caught myself practically drooling over how beautiful a shot was. They really do a fantastic job in animating.Another big aspect of the production that has great importance is the voice acting. I think Ellen DeGeneres's voice acting for Dory in Finding Nemo is one of the greatest on screen performances of all time. The voices in Up capture the feelings of the characters perfect. Ed Asner voices Carl. He is grumpy, determined, but there is a lot going on under the surface that slowly rises up as the film progresses. Jordan Nagai voices Russell and gives exactly what we could possibly ask from a child actor: to be himself. Even the co-director and writer Bob Peterson does a great job as the voice of the dog Dug (also the voice of Mr. Ray in Finding Nemo). Other talents like Christopher Plummer, Delroy Lindo, and John Ratzenberger, the only actor to have an appearance in all 10 of the Disney/Pixar feature films.Like most Pixar films, so much relies on the music. My least favorite of the 10 films is Cars, a film that have a heavy modern soundtrack. I like it when they stick to their creative guns and fire off something new and fantastic. They were much better about it with WALL-E, mixing in original with with existing tunes like the Hello, Dolly! soundtrack. A very nice touch. Here with Up we have a brand new score that is inspirational and fitting to the story. There is a sort of waltz like we are floating across a dance floor. It fits quite nicely.Where Up falters is...nowhere. I have seen the film twice already and both times I left completely satisfied. The animation is some of their best and the story is tight and perfect. It stays the course and carries you the entire way. It's beautiful, poetic, and uplifting. Expect to be dazzled and wowed by this one.","

"ClaytonDavis","15 June 2009","Pixar is on a roll, plain and simple. Up is the best film of the year so far and in the top tier of Pixar's best. We'll have another contender on our hands for a possible Best Picture nomination but the early release date is a damper on it. It'll definitely be the frontrunner for the Animated Category and screenplay.The colors are exquisite, the storyline is marvelous, and the characters are well thought out and charming. Go catch it and experience the wonder. It's more dramatically stimulating than taking on the comedy notion. It tugs major heart strings and is absolutely heartbreaking. ****/****","

"q-59194","8 June 2020","At the beginning of the film, the review of the life of the old couple is undoubtedly the biggest tear point. They lived a very good and happy life. When they are old, they still love each other deeply. Even if one of them is no longer there, Carl still take a risk in the last time of life with their common dream, just like a child with curiosity not afraid of everything. For life and dreams, no matter how old you are, it is not a hindrance.","

"MovieDude1893","8 June 2009","Up {dir. Pete Docter, 2009} ****/**** Pixar's Up is the best film of the year so far, by far. In telling a simple adventure story, they cover ground that they had yet to cover before. Both the humor and heartbreak of the film seem completely more mature than any of Pixar's previous works. The film is perfectly paced and structured in a very careful way to allow each moment to have a satisfying and slightly surprising. Pixar continues to amaze not only with their technical bravado, but with their thematic courage. Up is definitely in the uppermost echelon of their work, a hilarious, and in turns heartbreaking, work of great magnitude and power. Visually the film is rich and thrilling and emotionally it is satisfying. I cannot wait to see it again!","

"willcundallreview","5 November 2015","Animation has had its marks throughout its short history before Up, you have Toy Story really being Pixar's massive contribution and in truth the introduction to computer-animated movies. Up I feel should be remembered for being a massive step in not only how animation is done visually, but also how animations can be compared on the same level as any other movie out there. This is truly a masterpiece, it builds itself into an emotional roller-coaster that also makes you laugh and really this is exactly how to do animation perfectly.The story see's Carl Fredricksen an old man living by himself after his wife has died, that isn't where the plot picks up from though no, first it has to toy with your emotions and oh man the start to this film is tough to not feel something for. We see Carl's life and it has been good to him, it had its hard moments but most times he and his wife were extremely happy together, until she passed away and that is where the story picks up from. Carl made a promise to his wife to set up a house on top of a place called ""Paradise Falls"", a large waterfall somewhere in South America, and he is going to do it with balloons of all things. The film sways around, frantic at times and then sweet again and although that may not sound so good, it is in fact timed to perfection; the movie never loses momentum and keeps you watching from the first second to the last.Pixar haven't just made a great film, they've made an astounding one and also one that very much deserved its Best Picture nomination at the 82nd Academy awards. Pete Docter directs this in a visually stunning way, he not only gets the most out of the rich colours on offer, but he also puts things in that look amazingly real. Jonas Rivera's script is fine as well and really lays the foundations for all the comedy side if this; this is really one movie where physical humour is entwined well with comedy in dialogue. The characters are fantastically developed as well with not only Carl well done, the young boy Russell is finely thought up as well, he and Carl create one of the best duo's in animation movies.The way in which it also uses it's colour to bring out everything is even more impressive, the fine tones of the clothing, the beautiful animation style and the just general way in which this flows is beautiful. It is such a lovable movie as well, one that is maybe recommended for the kids but this is one for the adults too because this is one thing that can make anyone cry, whether that be by the funny bits in this or the heart wrenching moments.So Up, one of the best animations ever, for sure. I don't really have a group of people I would recommend this to but I mean that in a way where I believe that anyone can enjoy this. It's one of Pixar's finest for years and shows they are one of the most consistent movie churners out there, producing film after film that are not only movies that are financially successful, but also one's with big hearts as well.","

"mellowstreet","11 October 2009","Do not take young children to see UP. The movie starts with a depressing montage of an young boy meeting, marrying, and then burying the love of his life. They grow old together, childless, after finding out that she is barren, and then the wife dies. That is how UP opens and it only gets worse from there. There is physical assault, the endangerment of a child, savage dogs, fire, more physical assault and death (again). There is nothing uplifting or redeeming about UP and most of the young children in the theatre had to be carried out crying, because sections of it are dark, menacing and terrifying. The parents I was with agreed that this had to be the product of a disturbed mind and castigated Disney for ever releasing such violent dark content. Nobody had any idea how UP got its rating, with all the violence and darkness. This movie can and probably will damage the Disney brand in terms of how much parents trust it in future. Not suitable for children and by no means is it an uplifting, funny or enjoyable film.","

"socrates99","15 June 2009","The problem is the storyline. Love parts of it, like the review of the old man's past life, and the tie-in to what he finds in South America. But some of the contrivances are as annoying as they are helpful, for example, the device that lets dogs talk. And then there's the way the floating house seems to drag the action down in places. Still, the many little quirks of an old man embodied in Mr Fredricksen's figure are pretty much breathtaking as is those of a young boy embodied in Russell. Ellie is fleshed out as a character so quickly and assuredly that I was flummoxed trying to imagine what kind of a team could have produced her. But then most of the art work is completely awe-inspiring and entrancing. (I found the bird Kevin to be disappointing, though.) I guess I would have made the story a little less wild, these films deserve to be instant classics, and I can't help feeling some of the more wild parts are going to hold it back. By the way the opening cartoon about storks delivering babies was a complete pleasant surprise and a clear indication of the level of genius at Pixar. I'm guessing they wanted us to practice dropping our mouths open.","

"beegeebright","29 June 2009","Are people just brainwashed or stupid? This is the worst movie I have seen in a long, long time. If there isn't an entirely new generation of children afraid of dogs permanently I'll be very surprised. The lack of imagination is overwhelming. A grumpy old man - my, my, that's never been thought of before. A fat scout, how adorable. Absent father, what a surprise. The entire movie is about loss, that is all. First part is loss of innocence, then loss of a baby, loss of the hope of a baby, loss of wife, loss of will, loss of home, loss of father, loss of dreams. Then when by use of the balloons he does get to his dream place, no one, no one points out that he has to lose faith in the hero of his childhood, he is the explorer who had inspired him and Ellie to want to go to Paradise Falls in the first place! Now he is evil! He also has to be at least 100 years old!! Since Carl is supposed to be 78 and Muntz was his hero when he was 10. The time line is just all messed up, but the whole movie is so messed up. What a pile of junk! Evidently Pixar can put out anything and the clones will line up to praise it and see it, but I won't, never again. I felt robbed since it cost me $11 to see the 3-D version. It was no better. The problem was the plot.","

"freemantle_uk","25 October 2009","No one at the moment can match Pixar in the world of CGI animation at the moment. They made a lot of instant classics, with only one film being a flop (Cars). No one in Hollywood has even come close, and all studios should follow the Pixar philosophy of story comes first.The plot of Up tells the story of Carl Fredricksen (Edward Asner), an elderly man who's wife Ellie had died and about to face evident from his home. Instead of giving in and going to live in a retirement home, Carl decides to go on the adventure trip to South America that he and his wife were never about to do. He attaches hundreds of helium balloons to his house and floats to South America. But he has a stowaway, Russell (Jordan Nagai), an 8-year-old Wilderness Explorer. When the two reach South America, they come to a strange rainforest, with a large colourful bird which loves chocolate and Russell calls Kevin, and a Golden Retrevier called Dug (Bob Peterson) who has a collar that allows him to talk. With this jungle is a mad elderly explorer, Charles F. Muntz (Christopher Plummer), and Carl and Ellie's childhood hero. He created the collars to allow his pack of dogs to speak, and wants to capture the bird to show to the world.Pixar has a strong philosophy which obviously works. They have a old-fashion style but it works. They is a strong story and character development. The actors in this film were casted because they had the right voice, not cause they are a big name actor. This is a right move, especially because children don't care who voices the film, only if they are good. They is brilliant designs, direction, with excellent jokes, especially Russell and the dogs. There are sight gags, slapstick, but also some more adult-aimed jobs involving observational humour. There is also a good amount of action, some reminding me of Peter Jackson's version of King Kong. They is a emotion element, especially the montage at the beginning of the film. It makes you feel sad for Carl and Ellie. Pixar films also often trend to have a message about family relationships, like Finding Nemo and the Incredibles. This time the focus is on the love between Carl and Ellie, the surrogate relationship between Carl and Russell and Russell need for a fatherly figure. There is also the themes of unfulfilled dramas and hero worship.A perfectly enjoyable film for the whole family.","

"seanlflannery","1 May 2022","Up is one of those Pixar films that stands out from the rest in telling a story that is more grounded in reality while also having that flair of fantasy that Pixar is known for. The movie follows our main character, Carl (Played by Edward Asner), as he flies his house to South America to fulfill the dream of his deceased wife Ellie, while also being accompanied by Russel (Played by Jordan Nagai), an eight year old who is part of a boy scout troop trying to earn his merit badges. As Russel and Carl walk across the plateau of Paradise Falls, they come into contact with Dug (Played by Bob Peterson), Kevin the bird and the antagonist Charles Muntz (Played by Christopher Plumber), who is on the search for Kevin to win back his honor as an adventurer.One of the best aspects of the film is certain motifs that occur throughout the film's musical scores. During the flash-forward of Carl's entire life at the beginning of the film up until the current era, a song known as ""Married Life"" plays during this segment. Not only does the music work in tandem with the flash-forward, emphasizing the more emotional and impactful sequences during this scene, the combination of notes that comprise the song show up in other scores in the film's soundtrack. The movie really doesn't want to viewer to forget everything that this short sequence represents: The joy and pain shared by Carl and Ellie's love endured through up until the very end of her life. It's the one thing that pushes Carl to fulfill what he promised all those years ago.This leads to the thematic elements of the film. What makes ""Up"" appealing is that the film is all about loss and dealing with that loss. Throughout the film, Carl is motivated to get his home all the way to the other end of Paradise Fall's Plateau because that is what his late wife would've wanted. He promised to her in his childhood that he would take her there and they would have a house right next to the waterfall. However, during the flash-forward of Carl's life, it's revealed that they never had the chance to go out and experience that dream, and the hustle and bustle of real life and all the problems it comes with kept getting in the way of that dream.Carl ended up making promises he couldn't keep with the rest of the supporting cast, which by the time he truly reaches the end of his journey, he finds that his world is even more bleak as his house has been weathered down due to the trip through the jungle and everything is practically in ruin. The only thing he truly had left at that point was Ellie's old journal. He flicks through it, reminiscing about the past, and then it gets to that particular page where Ellie talks about the things she was going to do. When this page is shown throughout the film, it's never flicked past beyond the very first instance at the beginning of the film where all the pages are blank. As Carl laments, he notices a frame of a polaroid, which causes him to flick through all the pages to discover that everything she was going to do was just living her married life with Carl, and the last page gives Carl the last bit of closure he needed:""Thanks for the adventure - Now go have a new one!""The scene that followed, where Carl started moving all the furniture and belongings he accumulated over the years out of the house just to get the house airborne again to follow Russel back to the Muntz's Ship, demonstrated Carl's acceptance as he was slowly letting go of the past that was holding him back throughout the film. After the end of the climax, this is solidified even more so as he chooses the let the house fall into the clouds out of sight, where he finally lets go of the weight he was carrying just so he could move on and go on a new adventure just like his wife wished.To compare the film's theme to another piece of media, the Video Game ""Silent Hill 2"" has a very similar theme where James Sunderland enters the town of Silent Hill in search of his wife Mary, who died three years prior to a disease. As James wanders the town, certain events take place where the supernatural aspect of the town seems to almost torment James about the passing of his wife and, depending on how you play the game, can impact the ending of the story. The ""Leave"" ending has a scene where James gets to talk to Mary one last time, in which she tells him that he should go and live his life without the guilt of her death weighing him down, and James leaves Silent Hill a better person and adopts a little girl named Laura, who was with Mary in her final days. The tones of these two stories are drastically different and written with different audiences in mind, yet I couldn't help but correlate the two overarching themes between each other.Overall, Up is a film that is both fun for the kids and extremely moving for adults. It's a very good film with a genuine message behind it that's all about moving on from hardships and learning to live in the moment.","

I thought this was a really good and very funny film! Carl, Russell, and Dug are the perfect team of comedy! When Carl is a young boy, he meets a new friend named Ellie and find that they both love adventure. They get married and spend their lives together. When Ellie passes away, Carl becomes depressed and forgets about his old promise to Ellie about visiting Paradise Falls in South America. Carl is soon visited by a little boy named Russell, who is trying to get his ""Assisting the Elderly"" badge. Carl soon turns his house into an airship using thousands of balloons. He finds out that Russell was still on his house and assists him in his adventures. Carl runs into his boyhood hero, who actually turns out to be his enemy. With the help of Russell and Dug, the lovable talking dog, Carl tries to save a female bird named Kevin by any means necessary. I highly recommend that you go UP!!!","

I will first start off by saying the amount of work put into drawing all those balloons in just mindblowing and visually stunning . Also well I may have a bit of a bias Because I have been a scout. I love russell and find him very funny. If there is one problem I have with the movie it's that you will know the villain as soon as you see him. Also the final act of the movie can be a bit ridiculous. But to be fair we are talking about a movie where balloons can lift a whole house. Other than that it is a really fun adventure of a film.","

"christopher_m_k","7 June 2009","""Up"" is merely fine. There is little to like or dislike. The story isn't particularly engaging, and everything is fairly predictable. The jokes are bland and good for little more than a smirk. But the cartoon wasn't preachy, as animated movies seem to have become in recent years. I saw the 3-D version, and I wasn't particularly impressed. Although the 3-D provides added depth, the effect was very subtle. I was hoping for something that popped out of the screen more. I see no need for understatement in a 3-D cartoon, especially one that leans so heavily on the fantastic and implausible. In short, I'm confused by all the praise this movie has gotten, and I think the 3-D version is a waste of time and money. And to put this within the top 20 movies of all time on IMDb (its current ranking) is absurd.","

"Troy_Campbell","30 September 2009","The word on the street was that Pixar's latest finally showcased the true potential 3D has in the movie market. Now we aren't talking about the gimmicky extra dimension you find at studio theme parks in the U.S. or in those schlocky horror movies like My Bloody Valentine and The Final Destination - whose sole purpose are to make you duck and weave as things are swiped and hurtled at you - the third dimension here would add depth to each and every frame like never before seen. The word on the street was right. There is nothing cheap or sore on the eyes here, just subtle 3D that supports, not replaces, a worthy tale. If this is the direction that 3D is heading in, then I am very excited indeed.Pixar (now owned by Disney) aren't the leading company in animated movies just because of the visual benchmark they continually set. They understand that the story comes first and without it the breathtaking imagery will mean next to nothing. With Up we have an endearing yarn about following your dreams before it is too late, which is genuinely moving for the most part, but it seems to steer into adult territory a little too often. Don't misunderstand, this is a truly wonderful story and it is nice to find a 'kids' movie that isn't afraid to make the audience, both young and old, think, however it could have used a lighter touch to get across the same message. An extra laugh here and there would've been welcomed too.We have seen and loved a toy cowboy and spaceman, the last robot on earth, a clownfish and an ugly green ogre yet Carl is one of the most unlikely protagonists to feature in an animated family movie yet: a grumpy old man. However it is a breath of fresh air to see this square-jawed, button-nosed man in his seventies lead the way in a world that inhabits talking dogs and a female exotic bird named Kevin. His offsider, the loveably pudgy Russell, almost steals the show though. His bumbling voice and priceless facial expressions pave the way to majority of the laughs and subsequently ensure his escapades are the most enjoyable to watch.Toy Story or Finding Nemo this is not. But worth seeing at the cinema in superb 3D this is.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)","

The animation is simply spellbinding, but for me, it is the story that makes this great, it's a tale of unfulfilled dreams, constantly interrupted by the problems of life.....More importantly the comedy moments are just pure genius...The supporting characters are equally funny, Doug, Evan, Alpha-Dog.....simply the greatest animated movie ever made.","

"m_shankar20","20 September 2009","It is difficult to get the image of that flying house suspended by countless colorful balloons off your head, once you see Up. I guess, it would stay with me for the rest of my life.Up easily climbs up to claim a place amongst the finest animation films ever. Not surprisingly, it comes from Pixar, the team that gave us Wall-E, Ratatouille and Finding Nemo. Also, after a quite a long time, its about 'people' as against a garbage-crusher, a rat and fishes respectively earlier. Up is as colorful as an animation film ever was. What a color riot! Some frames just stay with you, the mastery of their composition impossible to miss.The choice of characters itself breaks clichés. A grumpy old man as the hero and an amiable obese kid as his ally completely contrast against what one would have thought would be the choice for characters who are supposed to be on an adventure trip to South America. Both characters endear themselves to us as the story moves along.Two things that stood out for me - (a) The initial sequence that chronicles the life of Fredrickson and Ellie together is a master-stroke. As it ends, it leaves the eyes moist - and all that without a word spoken. (b) The closing shot with the house perched besides the paradise falls - it is one for the textbooks; probably one of the best closing shots ever.Not to be missed at any cost.","

"dostan-85075","22 October 2019","I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be.While searching a film in order to watch with my family together on friday night, I discovered an animation well-know as ""Up"".
As a big fan of ""Finding Nemo"", I considered/believed that Pixar could never give me a feeling of satisfaction.
I was wrong.At the centre of ""Up"" is Carl Fredricksen,
a grouchy widower and retired balloon salesman in late middle age. He, after the death of his lovely wife, Ellie, finds himself alone in a world where he is disregarded by people around him and in risk of being sent to a retirement home.
For the purpose of not losing the house he spent his whole life in, he decides to go on one last adventure to complete a lifelong dream he shared with Ellie of traveling to Paradise Falls in South America. So he hooks his house up to thousands of balloons and sets off into the unknown, but all doesn't go as planned when he accidentally picks up a stowaway - a young Boy Scout named Russell, who affects on Carl's life positively.Up is funny, heartfelt, and never less than entertaining.There is plenty to like about this movie - from its gorgeous look to a surprisingly touching story.
Even the first 10 minutes are some of the best, and most emotional, sequences of any film in recent memory, but are just the beginning of a movie that manages to interject some laugh-out-loud funny moments with a rather tender back story that tugs at the heart strings.","

"jonnydmullan","6 April 2020","In Up, we follow Carl Fredricksen, a widower and retired balloon salesman, who doesn't want his home to be destroyed by the development of commercial buildings, so attaches hundreds of balloons to it and flies it to Paradise Falls, him and his wife's dream destination.Up is great. It's a fun, family film. The story is interesting and very engaging. However, the movie falls into two very obvious sections for me and I will review them as such.The first section is the development of the story, right up to the point they reach Paradise Falls. This section is brilliant. Really great viewing. The beginning flashback sequence with Ellie is absolute perfection. It harkens back to the WALL-E and Ratatouille-esque silent story telling technique. It evokes a real sense of emotion while watching.The second section is where Up loses steam for me. I think the humour becomes overly slapstick and for me, was hit and miss at times. Doug the dog provides comic relief and the ""point"" joke I found funny. However, I felt Russell became very silly. He is obviously an intelligent boy, but some of what he says and does doesn't reflect this.However, in saying all of this, I think Up ends strongly. I really appreciate what how it wraps up and it redeemed some of my earlier grievances.Overall, Up is brilliant. I don't think you're missing out on much if you skip it, but I still think it is worth watching.","

"chandean-69762","26 April 2021","""That might sound boring ... but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most.""
Up has to be the most over hyped Pixar movie.First off let me say, the main theme for this film is so good it practically became Pixar's own theme, it's so beautiful.The first 10 minutes are the peak of the film. Lovely, emotional, and surprisingly mature. After those 10 minutes I don't really care for it anymore as it descends into goofiness.I found Russell to be an extremely annoying and unlikeable character, (ironic that I used one of his quotes), but I do also really like where his character ends up.Then we have the dogs, I pretty much despise everything to do with the dogs (Dug especially). I found them used mostly for comedic relief that wasn't needed in the first place, and they serve no larger purpose to the story other than henchmen for the villain.The villain never clicked with me either, his character seemed overly aggressive and evil for no rhyme or reason.And then we have Kevin, who singlehandedly saved this film. Her design and personality was just what this film needed. They should've just used Kevin as the comedic relief instead of the dogs in my opinion.Up very much conflicts me. There are parts in this film that are super beautiful and touching, then we have parts that are overly goofy and unneeded.Up does have a really nice story, (though mostly forgettable), an iconic score, and of course great animation, it's honestly a good movie, but I feel like the stuff I didn't like heavily outweighed the stuff I did like.","

"Eternality","22 February 2011","Directed by Pete Doctor and co-directed by Bob Peterson, Up is from the guys who created Monsters Inc. (2001) and who work at one of modern cinema's most consistent production companies - Pixar Animation Studios. Up is the tenth feature film from Hollywood's Jewel of Creativity following the successes of films such as Toy Story (1995), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), and Wall.E (2008).This latest picture is another bold step away from what Pixar has done over the decade, and together with Wall.E (which was considerably bold enough), both represent a significant change in priorities in the company's vision. Producing family-friendly fare is a thing of the past. Now they are using CG technology to transcend animation filmmaking, to give the once isolated genre devoted to entertaining five-year-olds a strong cinematic identity, one that mature audiences can find themselves unashamed of appreciating.Up is perhaps the most risky venture by Pixar thus far. The lead character is not a cute fish, or a lovable rat, or a friendly monster, but a short, bespectacled, and grumpy old man with a face as unappealing as a box. How marketable is that? Fears that Up could be Pixar's first real flop are swept away within the first fifteen minutes. The prologue sequence that introduces Carl Fredricksen is a gem both in its execution and its ability to comprehensively and instantly portray the old man as someone we have no difficulty empathizing.Carl's dream of visiting Paradise Falls in South America is triggered to reality when he is forced to relocate to a retirement village. That morning he made his house fly, lifted by thousands of colorful balloons, and propelled by wind as it pushed the curtain-like sails hung out on rails on each side. Russell, a chubby boy with a zest for adventure happened to be on Carl's front porch when the house made its ascent. Together they explore South America and evade obstacles which appear more life-threatening than they expect.The introduction of the actual villain Charles Muntz in Up comes slightly too late into the film. Because of limited development of the character, Charles is not as imposing as he should be. While it does create an extent of fear, there is not a moment in the film when we have doubts of the protagonists surviving unscathed. Likewise, the climax arrived too quickly as well. Although the adventures of the leads are mostly engaging, they appear short-lived. I see it as a flaw because the filmmakers could have spent more time adding more action set-pieces to the fray.As with Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle (2004), a major influence to this film, physical logic has to be cast aside. Many of the scenes can never happen in reality. Can an old man really navigate a floating house with his frail physique? Can balloons really lift a house? Up tends to indulge in fantasy far more than reality. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but when a film whose devotion to human emotions and bonding (themes grounded in reality) far eclipse that of its far-fetched plot, there is a fair chance that it might turn out to be a mixed bag of unclear priorities. And it does to a small extent. Up is still effective, uplifting, and mostly heartwarming, but it is one of the less accomplished works by Pixar. But that is still saying something.GRADE: B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.","

He came over and she put the book down. The two men looked at each other and she took his hand.""With your life, is the best adventure."" I think the moment two people look at each other, the old woman said this sentence to the old man in her heart.When the old man placed two chairs neatly over Paradise Falls, he had fulfilled his promise, fulfilled his last remembrance of his beloved, and began his new promise and new guardship.","

"MzzKaren","4 March 2023","Sheer perfection. I am a little old lady myself, I love it. Especially since Carl is drawn as ""Spencer Tracy"", and Charles is drawn as ""Kirk Douglas"". That was a wonderful touch for me. Russell is played exceptionally well. I must say thay Elle reminded me of me, red hair and all, so I was predisposed to love it from the start. The animation is glorious. The music is a lullaby for your heart. The script cannot be improved upon. The production and direction are unmatched. But the very best thing are the actors and their voices, especially Jordan.Well, 'doug"" is a close second. Anyone who did not absolutely go gaga for this movie has a stone for a heart.",NA
"rrrrr-94336","27 July 2016","First, I was surprised at the title of this film. In Japan, the title is ""Old Carl and a house which flies in the sky"", so I thought ""Up"" was too short.anyway, the story describes isolation which characters in this film have very well. Carl lost his beloved wife. They have no child, so he starts to live alone. Russell feels a gap between he and his father so he feels lonely. Charles Muntz is a villain of this film, but he is unfortunate circumstance. He was denied his opinion by everyone and people who praised him fell away from him when he was young, so he becomes a person who can't believe anyone bu his dogs. These situation can occur around us, so I think this story is not only fantasy but also human story. Friendship beyond the age and the species impresses viewers. Also the scene which Carl's house flying with colorful balloons in the sky is one of the best part of it.",NA
"thewittyman-1","16 May 2009","Coming off last year's hit Wall-E, Pixar attempts to sweep the hearts (and pockets) of moviegoers with Up. I had the privilege of seeing the film in Philadelphia two weeks before its release. Since Wall-E is in my personal top ten, I couldn't contain my excitement for the excitement Pixar had in store. But I was a bit worried that the premise of a man and his flying home couldn't translate into a feature. So is Up a worthy addition to Pixar's critically acclaimed catalogue?Well, just take a wild guess.Up revolves around 78 year old balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen, who has kept adventure alongside his childhood love Ellie. Meeting as pipsqueaks, the pair shared a lust for escapism and eventually married. Together they had this fantasy of going to Paradise Falls, an elusive world in South America where many wonders lay. But through a somber montage, we see things fall apart and pass away, leaving Carl alone in the house the two rebuilt through their lives.I should mention that Up has many sad (yet endearing) moments, for Carl deals with emotional loss while trying to rekindle his flame of adventure. After the aforementioned montage, one audience member burst into audible tears; I admittedly had to fight some back as well. When you see Carl wishing to be alone and personifying Ellie through their home, you can't help but feel (insert sad adjective).But alas! This *is* a Pixar film, after all. As Carl begins his journey through the skies, we're soon treated to blissful wonder, pure excitement, cunning suspense, and, of course, laughable humor. Pixar is the master of manipulating emotions, and a roller-coaster's worth is packed into 96 minutes.While resting in his buoyant home, Carl receives an unwelcomed addition to his adventure: 8 year old Russell, a Wilderness Explorer (i.e. Boy Scout) who helps Carl for an aiding the elderly merit badge. I originally thought the chipper chubbster would be annoying, catering mainly to the younger audience. However, Russell provides comical relief and has surprising emotional depth.As the characters' journey continues, we discover the pair is more alike than the 70 year difference would suggest. Along their way we meet a rare (and hungry) bird with a sense of humor, dogs who can talk, and many other surprises that I won't spoil. I honestly wasn't bored at all; even during the slower parts Pixar gives us much to admire.Unsurprisingly, Up looks AMAZING. While I didn't see it in 3-D, the 2-D version has plenty to marvel at. Instead of going for realism a la Wall-E, Up tries a more stylized look a la The Incrediblesand succeeds marvelously. I love Carl's squarish head, the vibrant colors, the miniscule details, everything. As a technology junkie, wondering about the programming and rendering used to make the film made my head spin. Things like the scripted physics behind Carl's balloons or the global light reflecting off Russell's chocolate bar were enough to give me a nerdgasm.The sound is fantastic as well. Again, Pixar gives us a great original theme which is mostly played on piano. It's sparse in emotional parts, loud and boisterous in action scenes. Edward Asner does an exceptional job voicing Mr. Fredricksen. All the technical aspects are what we've come to expect from Pixarwhich basically means they're perfect.However, I don't think Up is perfect overall. Granted, this is a film about a man who attaches balloons to his house and flies away, but there were moments that made me question certain choices or actions despite Up's fantastical setting. Furthermore, the central villain was a bit weak (not on a moral scale, though) and quickly came into play with little buildup. Though these seem a bit nitpicky, I was brought of the film at a few points and questioned certain things after the movie finished.Yet these complaints aren't deterring me from jumping on line and putting on 3-D glasses when Up is released. While it's no Wall-E in my book, Up is a film that will take your emotions up, up, and away. It's about loss, love, and realizing the destination isn't what necessarily matters; the adventure getting there is sometimes the most important thing. So take a seat beside me when Up is releasedbut could you get me some tissues this time? Oh, and while you're over there, you might as well grab that Oscar too.9.2 / 10, rounded up for Pixar's hard work through 10 films",NA
"jon.h.ochiai","7 June 2009","After the first 15 minutes of Peter Docter and Bob Peterson's ""Up"", I was in tears. I kept thinking this does not bode well for me. In those 15 minutes without much dialogue, the miraculous storytelling of Docter, Peterson, and Thomas McCarthy realizes such heart felt poignancy. We see the life of widower Carl Fredricksen and his wife Ellie up until the present. Carl (brilliantly voiced by Ed Asner) is a lonely old man, who believes the best part of his life has passed him. In ""Up"" Carl was supposed to go on Ellie's dream trip to Paradise Falls in South America, but this does not happen. Instead of surrendering to a retirement home, Carl decides to go on the trip to Paradise Falls by hooking up a fleet of balloons to his house. In the process Carl inadvertently high jacks spirited Wilderness Explorer Scout Russell (wonderful Jordan Nagai). Thus, the adventure begins.""Up"" is the best movie of the year. The animation is visually astounding. Whether we watch Carl's house navigate through the clouds and horrendous storms, or Russell befriending the giant brightly colored mythological bird in the deepest jungles of South America, whom he names ""Kevin"". As it turns out Kevin is actually a she. The Paradise Falls themselves are amazingly beautiful. I can even be with the more out there narrative elements like dogs talking through electronic collar translators, because it is absurd context. I loved dog Dug (playfully voiced by Bob Peterson), who initially finds Carl and Russell. Turns out, the dogs' owner is famed explorer Charles Muntz (sublimely evil Christopher Plummer), who is also searching for ""Kevin"" in an attempt to reinvent his ridiculed legacy.At the heart of ""Up"" is Carl and Russell. Directors Docter and Peterson create a magical chemistry. At first Russell occurs as an annoying Explorer scout in search of his last merit badge—by helping elderly Carl. Carl is this cantankerous old man, who seems to be waiting out the rest of his life. Throughout he keeps calling to ""Ellie"" in lieu of speaking to real people—other than Russell. In a hysterical exchange Carl suggests playing a game: Who can go the longest without saying anything? Excited Russell says, ""Cool! My Mom loves that game!"" However, there is more to Russell than blinding eagerness. While struggling to pitch his tent, Carl inquires why Russell's Dad didn't teach him. Russell replies that his Dad was a great camper, but he didn't get to teach him. Later in the beautiful moment of ""Up"", Carl looks through Ellie's photo album. Sitting in his chair he mouths, ""Cross my heart"" Again, I was in tears. ""Up"" is all eloquence and heart. Docter and Peterson brilliantly balance the hysterical and the touching.""Up"" is all about the wonder and beauty of life. You wonder how Docter and Peterson can circle back and conclude the story. They do, and the fade away scene is as poignant and sweet as anything you will experience. ""Up"" is beautiful and amazing.",NA
"Danusha_Goska","15 June 2009","""Up"" opens with a remarkable sequence that tells much of a man's life story with minimal dialogue. I've never seen anything quite like it in an animated movie. The closest I can think of is silent film, which also used minimal dialogue. I was very impressed, even as I was watching, to see how much the animators were able to convey, and the depth of the material. A couple of very challenging life events are addressed, in ways so graceful and subtle that one could not take offense or decide that the subject matter was inappropriate for a children's film or an animated film. I was fully engaged for this sequence, and ready for more. The opening is capped by a lovely, colorful, effervescent scene depicting a house taking flight. After that, the movie was still good, but it didn't engage me as much.",NA
"asifrahman-76909","23 December 2022","If someone were to ask me what qualities would make up a great film, I would sum it up with these 4 things:
1) Pretty good atmosphere
2) Well-written non-obnoxious humour
3) A marvellous plot
4) Excellent and likeable main characters who grow effectively during the course of the film
Having watched this film three times, I can sincerely say that Up includes all four of these things. The Incredibles (2004) also contains all four.The montage of Carl and Ellie growing old together is without dialogue and will probably bore some kids. However looking back on it I consider it the most moving opening to a pixar film ever. Being without dialogue makes it more moving and it's symbolic of Pixar's awesome animation.I shed a couple of tears at the scene when Carl sits alone at the funeral. Life is full of happiness and downsides - the animators beautifully depicted that here.The backstory to why Carl wants to go to Paradise Falls is well-told. Ed Asner's acting when Carl and Russell arrive is just so satisfying. Also, I like that Russell is a character in his own right. He's somebody who's likeable and holds his own wishes.The plot is engaging and moving. The climax to the film ties everything together nicely.The music is fabulous as well. While the 7 minutes of story before Paradise Falls drag a bit, it doesn't stop the film getting a 10.",NA
"Michael_Elliott","12 December 2009","Up (2009)**** (out of 4) A marvelous achievement ranks as one of the greatest animated movies ever made. The story is pretty simple as an elderly man, after the death of his beloved wife, decides to finally explore South America as the two had always planned. He ties millions of balloon onto his house and takes flight when he notices a young cub scout is along for the ride. Once they hit the jungles the two will discover what's really important in life as they have one battle after another. Even though I had heard this was a great film, I was really shocked to see just how great it actually was. I was a little skeptical after being somewhat letdown by WALL-E, a film I liked but one I didn't feel lived up to the hype. Everything in this film hits all the right marks and I'd go even further by saying it's one of the greatest animated movies I've ever seen. This movie not only has a great love story but it's also an excellent adventure film and buddy film. Not to mention all the great laughs and the masterpiece animation. The Carl character is without question one of the most memorable, lovable and just downright entertaining in the history of animation and I can't help but think that this character will go down in movie history like so many of the early Disney characters. The love story told early on between he and his wife was incredibly touching and more human than many of the live action love stories we get today. His then father-son relationship with the young boy is also incredibly touching as is his connections to that silly bird and talking dog. I really loved the look of the film and those balloons flying are certainly a beautiful site. I'm not a major fan of CG animation but the work being done by Pixar is something truly remarkable and that brilliant work continues here. This is certainly a movie that has a little bit of everything but what's so special is its heart and how it can communicate human emotions through animation.",NA
"Hitchcoc","19 January 2010","I immediately fell for this film. I think my favorite moment in the whole thing is when he meets Ellie for the first time. She is one of a kind and the animators did a lovely job of making her eternally beautiful. It has one of the most touching moments I've seen in any film. Then, of course, we need to suspend out disbelief, thinking that a house, propelled by helium balloons, can be raised from the ground, becoming airborne. What follows is a truly great story. We have a young Wilderness Scout who has all the hangups of modern youth, clueless in so many ways. We have a cast of incredible dogs who have been given the ability to speak through a device invented by the villain of the movie. There are complex relationships that transcend the usual kid plots. This one works to the end. Some people ask too many questions. While this movie is about science, we should not read too much into it. Just suffice it to say, it is full of adventure, close calls, bonding, and, of course, true love. I really believe this is one of the better films of this past year.",NA
"Qanqor","6 June 2009","Surprise! The curmudgeon is in the mainstream for a change: I loved this film. Much more than I expected to. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about it, everybody else has already done that. A fun adventure, some good comedy, and a surprising amount of heart. Never in a million years did I expect to be as moved by an animated fun movie like this as I was. Yes, there were a few nits I could pick on, mostly involving the villain, but they are easily overlooked given all that I liked about the movie.The problem with writing review for films I love (which I don't do very often) is that I never want to say too much, lest I give anything away. Better to just go see it yourself. But be warned: it's not all sunshine and light, there's some definite sadness in there as well.Out of curiosity, I read some of the ""Hated It"" reviews to see what people there would have to say. Very interesting. The main complaint seemed to be from parents who found it too heavy for their kids. Perhaps that's a valid complaint, I don't know, I'm not a parent. But it raises the interesting thesis that perhaps I, as an adult, responded to the movie so strongly precisely because it is a more adult film than your typical children's-fare animated movie. But I don't think that's a bad thing at all.",NA
"Kirpianuscus","7 July 2016","it has a touching message. this is its basic virtue. and, maybe, the most important. because it is a simple story about solitude, fundamental meetings, childhood, oldness and the dreams. because it is an adorable version of The Wizard of Oz for a generation who believes to have is more important than to be. and one of the applause for this splendid animation must be for the work of Edward Asner who impose a real fascinating Carl. not the adventure are the essence of film but the science to explore the essential traits of the ages. the beautiful transformation of characters who discover the meaning of life. the new perspectives about the past. and, sure, the importance of memories for an age who lives in the circle of memories and has the chance to discover the fascination of a living dream.",NA
"jgcorrea","23 November 2021","Why is this movie so popular? I find it a merely average animation. Nothing particularly stands out or really attracts. Sometimes the characters just annoy us It isn't bad, but it is'nt amazing. It's rather common, on both the entertainment and artistic parameters. It doesn't compare to classics like Fantasia or The Lion King. It is suitable for small children, kinda family movie to watch with the grandchildren. The characters are either uninteresting or immemorial. And the story's pace definitely doesn't go well.",NA
"inyourimage","5 June 2009","Unwanted Jewish-looking old man being pushed out of his home, unfairly deemed a 'menace to society,' to be put into a concen...I mean 'retirement home,' strives to realize the lifelong dream to relocate his home to the 'promised land,' carrying the memory of loved one who shared the dream but didn't make it, struggles to survive the ill-will of an obsessed Germanic-looking guy flying around in a Hindenburg-like airship, with a little Asian kid without a father tagging along. That about sums up the plot of 'Up.' Can we be any more obvious? The subliminal ethno-political allegorical symbolism was rampant in this movie, and it seems to be creeping more and more into Pixar movies. Pixar, please keep the politica agenda out and leave our children to their innocence! Other than that it was a cute movie with some chuckles. My niece seemed to like it. The sentimentality was strategically interwoven to tug on the little heart-strings of those who might not be emotionally mature, geopolitically aware, or not actively studying this curious phenomenon. I'm really going to have to start documenting my findings and write a book.",NA
"kosmasp","24 November 2009","As I have stated with their previous movies, it seems like Pixar can do no wrong. Apart from Cars that is and even that movie is pretty good (and if you are a car lover, you might even think it's fantastic). But with ""Up"" they made a story that is genuine and funny and just entertaining. And this years ""Best Animated Feature"" winner is ... well you get the picture! I actually try to avoid any trailer from a movie that I might see (which pretty much is every movie out there, but that's a different story), but I couldn't avoid watching the Up trailer in cinemas. Frankly it didn't hurt my movie experience. The trailer doesn't reveal too much, which is really great. You have this old man, who lives in his house, minding his own business. Until one day ... well if you have seen the trailer you know, what is going to happen. And you will wait for it to happen. And when it happens, you won't be disappointed! A great movie, for the young and the old ... and the in-between! Thank you Pixar and continue the good work!",NA
"real_kurvos","8 September 2010","I never wanted to watch this movie; I confess. But since so many people tries to shove it in my face to watch it, I decided to give it a try...Even though I was sceptical as I began to watch it, I thought the beginning was pretty good... until they made a montage about their life. That was just stupid. I thought it would be so much more interesting to have a story about the love between those two, how it developed (but I know it wouldn't be about that, but still). The more I saw of the movie, the more I did not like it. It felt cheesy, and used a lot of annoying movie clichés. Kid follows old man even though he tries to get rid of him, the main person's child icon turns out to be evil, the characters manages to get out of unbelievably difficult situations out of pure luck, old man hates his followers and wants them to leave him but he gets attached to them near the end... there's just tons and tons of stupid clichés I can't stand. The movie doesn't even try to be original. But the worst thing of all, was the dumb, dumb ending before we see what happens to the old man and the boy. I am talking about after the house disappears, we see it has landed RIGHT EXACTLY IN THE PERFECT SPOT from the painting, and the camera zooms out to calm dramatic ending music... this moment was so cheesy, so utterly stupid, I felt like I was going to puke. No, really; I felt it coming down my throat. I found it THAT stupid. I admit, it WAS sort of entertaining. But it's way too serious for kids, and way too cheesy for adults. This movie is like Ratatouille, proving Pixar movies are popular just because it's Pixar. Only REALLY good Pixar movies are Toy Story, The Incredibles and Monsters Inc. in my opinion; period.",NA
"Monotreme02","21 August 2009","Looking back, I can't help but to immediately notice a very interesting pattern in my past movie reviews. This is the third Pixar movie I have written a review for, and this will also be the third consecutive time that I will open the review with the following sentence: Pixar have done it again. Once again, they have proved that no animation studio – and no live action studio either, for that matter – can come anywhere near the sheer and utter quality of their entertainment, purely and simply put. Pixar have proved once again that they can take a concept and premise that doesn't sound particularly attractive at first, and turn it into a masterwork of cinema. They have proved that unlike their animation studio contemporaries, Pixar don't need celebrity voices and characters specifically designed to be packaged and ready for delivery to toy store shelves, and they certainly don't feel the need to patronize their young audience members by injecting into their films jokes that only parents can understand. And they have proved once again that unlike most live-action studio output, it is still possible to create compelling, dramatic and irresistibly entertaining cinema from original screenplays without falling into formulas, clichés or any other kind of compromise for the sake of the audience. In short, Pixar have once again proved that they are the best film studio working today, period.So what makes a Pixar movie tick? What makes this studio's output so consistently better than that of pretty much all the other film studios today, animated or otherwise? I think the answer can be summed up in one simple but crucial word: characters. For Pixar, as for all the great screenwriters both past and present, a film begins and ends with its characters; create compelling and identifiable characters and you can pretty safely bet that an equally compelling story will come along with them. Within the first ten minutes of this film, you know you're in for something different as you see Doctor portray in a completely dialogue-less montage an entire life-long relationship, from the shy childhood beginnings of our protagonist Carl and his soon-to-be-wife Ellie and through their ups and downs, hardships living a complete life together, and finally her eventual death, all the while their childhood dream hovering above them but never quite coming to fruition. It is a heartbreakingly beautiful and poignant sequence, probably the best ten-minute block Pixar have ever created, and while the film does take a slightly different direction from there, it doesn't cease from still bringing up very poignant topics throughout, including hardships of old age, unhealthy obsession, divorce, a child's rejection by his father, and other such resonant, real-life experiences that one wouldn't expect to see in a children's film. Here within lies Pixar's secret, which is additionally exemplified in the story and the humor in their films as well: they don't patronize their young audience members by providing two planes of existence in the film – jokes and plot points for the kids and another set for the adults – but rather, Pixar manage to find the subjects, plot points, visual gags and jokes that both children AND their parents can relate to. For example, I'm nowhere near being a parent yet, but I can imagine this film serving as a very good starting-off point for important parent-child discussions, such as divorce, deteriorating old age of grandparents, and where babies come from.The bottom line is that there is simply no studio quite like Pixar. Only they could represent more genuine human emotion and feelings in a silent, 6-minute short film than any major Hollywood production of the past 10 years (the short preceding the film, ""Partly Cloudy"", is one of Pixar's all-time best in my opinion, in terms of hilarity but also in terms of poignant emotional resonance). Only they could take a premise of a man tying helium balloons to his house and flying it to South America and turn it into one of the most dramatic, compelling and irresistibly entertaining films of the past few years. Only they could take a film whose protagonists are a grumpy, sour 80-year-old widower and a chubby, 8-year-old obnoxious Asian child and turn it into one of the most massive box office successes of the year. And for that, they deserve all the praise in the world, and them some.",NA
