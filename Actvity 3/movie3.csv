"gogoschka-1","26 December 2013","Personally, I've never seen anything as original in an animated film as in this deeply mythical fairytale. What a surreal idea for a movie! It's hard to find an adequate description (because I also don't want to spoil this in the slightest way) but this film has a sense of ""otherness"" to it - for lack of a better word - like none I've ever seen. And the strange, mythical nature of this film - apart from the amazing artwork - is probably one of the main reasons for its appeal to me. Maybe the themes of the story don't feel quite as strange to an eastern audience because they fit to a certain degree with some eastern/Asian mythologies - to me, this beautiful piece of wonder was something new. And a profoundly moving experience. Outstanding animation; funny, weird, scary and touching at the same time, this unique work of art is one I can't recommend enough. 10 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/","

"Buddy-51","3 May 2003","In Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar-winning animated feature, 'Spirited Away,' a young girl by the name of Chihiro and her parents stumble across an abandoned 'amusement park' that turns out to be a mysterious bathhouse for the spirit world (a la 'Carnival of Souls'). After her parents are turned into pigs, the young girl must infiltrate the bathhouse to find a way to make them human again. Chihiro encounters an amazing array of strange and exotic creatures abiding there, some of whom help her in her quest and some of whom don't.No one would ever deny the visual splendor and wealth of imagination that have gone into the look of this film. The animators have created an entire world filled with inhabitants that defy description. Moreover, the elegance of the backgrounds and the fluidity of the movement provide some of the best work in those areas that animation has ever offered. One appreciates the effort, especially in this day and age when imagination in movies is at such a premium. Therefore, I feel like a bit of an ingrate pointing out that 'Spirited Away' might actually have been a somewhat better film had the filmmakers opted for a little LESS imagination in favor of a little more discipline in the storytelling. The filmmakers are so busy trying to dazzle us with their creativity that we end up with more characters and subplots than the film can reasonably cope with. The story often feels arbitrary in nature, with events that seem unrelated to each other vying for our attention just so we can be impressed with how creative everyone is trying to be. The film seems to ramble for a good part of the time, and we find ourselves yearning for a tighter, more streamlined narrative to help keep us involved. In addition, there's a certain lack of logic that runs through most of the film, making us question why certain characters do what they do. For instance, why would a bunch of spirits be so concerned with eating, sleeping, making money, riding trains, etc.? The rules of this world don't seem to be laid down rigorously enough for us to understand what it's all supposed to be about.I don't want to sound like a total curmudgeon in criticizing a film that, apparently, many people, including innumerable critics, have hailed as a masterpiece. And I do concede that 'Spirited Away' has moments of great beauty and charm to more than compensate for its rather slow pacing and excessive length. A haunting trip on a ghostly train is, perhaps, the highlight of the film, a transcendent moment that hints at how great the rest of the film could have been had its makers not felt the need to pad out the story so consistently. Chihiro is a spunky, poignant and noble heroine, and a few of the other characters are compelling as well.'Spirited Away' offers much for the audience to gape and marvel at, but it lacks the drama to make us really care.","

"Morejambo54","29 December 2020","I enjoyed this movie but more towards the end. The first half of the movie was very odd, which is one of the main reasons I kept watching as I wanted to understand it but that didn't really happen. Not enough was explained and it felt like a mix of random events yet there was an actual story. Im struggling to come up with a reason of why no-face was even in the movie, he was just there. This movie isn't bad by any means, it's just lacking somethings in my opinion. I also didn't. Really feel in touch with any of the characters as no room was left for them to develop. The wired and wacky characters made the film very unique and interesting, the film is visually beautiful as well, I would personally want more depth.It is a good movie with a lot of potential. 7/10","

"supertom-3","2 April 2004","This is a wonderfully imaginative and fantastical children's fantasy. It is easy to see why it was perhaps the critical hit of 2002. The film is glorious to look at. It is a testament to old fashioned animation techniques that seem to be resigned to foreign animations. Of course there is some use of computer imagery for certain shots but they blend seamlessly and the overall artistry involved is superlative.This is the first Hayao Miyazaki film I have seen and I will certainly watch his others. The story plays on many elements successful with kids films, that transport you back to your own childhood and also allows the young audience to connect with the themes in the movie too. The story centres around Chihiro, a young girl about to move into a new place and who feels insecure about the new environment she will be living in. These fears become a part of her encounter with a strange abandoned amusement park that she and her parents find when they reach a dead end in their car. At the park they find that their is a stall that is seemingly open, with glorious displays of mouth watering food. There are no people about but Chihiros parents decide to gorge themselves on this bounty and pay later. As Chihioro explores she comes across a strange boy who warns her to get out before dark. It is too late however, because as night falls, ghosts are awakened, and then by the time she gets back to her parents they are turned into pigs. She then finds that the route she came from is gone and she is now trapped in this place, her only allie being the boy she met earlier. She is told to get a job at the centre piece of the park, a bath house run by Yubaba, an evil power mad witch. This is a bath house for the spirits and Chihiro has to find a job there before she is found and turned into an animal herself, then unable to save her parents.The story is imaginative and the characters and animations endlessly unique and strange. This is just so much more creative than Hollywood. The characters are likeable and we become engrossed with Chihiros adventures inside this bathhouse, and the characters she comes into contact with as she tries to get her parents back as humans and whilst trying to get back to the human world. What I also loved in this film is that the animation gives it a real sense of cinematography, the drawing makes the film stand out in a way that American animations rarely do. Another film I think of that looked really good was Bellville Rendezvous. Another great point in fact the best part of it, is the fantastic score. It really is uplifting and very original. This is just great film making. *****","

"Le-Samourai","20 July 2004","'Spirited Away' is the first Miyazaki I have seen, but from this stupendous film I can tell he is a master storyteller. A hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character. Miyazaki does this brilliantly in 'Spirited Away'. During the first fifteen minutes we have no idea what is going on. Neither does the main character Chihiro. We discover the world as Chihiro does and it's truly amazing to watch. But Miyazaki doesn't seem to treat this world as something amazing. The world is filmed just like our workaday world would. The inhabitants of the world go about their daily business as usual as full with apathy as us normal folks. Places and buildings are not greeted by towering establishing shots and majestic music. The fact that this place is amazing doesn't seem to concern Miyazaki. What do however, are the characters. Miyazaki lingers upon the characters as if they were actors. He infixes his animated actors with such subtleties that I have never seen, even from animation giants Pixar. Twenty minutes into this film and I completely forgot these were animated characters; I started to care for them like they were living and breathing. Miyazaki treats the modest achievements of Chihiro with unashamed bombast. The uplifting scene where she cleanses the River God is accompanied by stirring music and is as exciting as watching gladiatorial combatants fight. Of course, by giving the audience developed characters to care about, the action and conflicts will always be more exciting, terrifying and uplifting than normal, generic action scenes. Through Chihiro, Miyazaki is clearly (but non-patronisingly) talking to youth of Japan. There's a certain sense of revile about the youth of Japan at the moment. Many people consider them to be ill-mannered and baring no respect for their elders or their forefathers. They are simply bi-products of their material world and consumerism. 'Spirited Away' taps into this. At the start Chihiro is a selfish, spoiled, whiny brat. But as she plunges deeper into the spirit world, she becomes more independent, more assured, more respectful and learns some manners. No Face, a black figure with a white mask, is the catalyst behind Chihiro's transformation. Once he is let into the bathhouse, we are no longer tourists  the story propels forth. Watching No Face prey on the greed of the workers is a terrifying delight. The three main characters in Miyazaki's youth allegory are Chihiro, No Face and Bô. All of these characters are disconnected with their world. They are lonely, misunderstood and largely ignored. But when they go on their journey together, they united and become stronger individuals.Miyazaki also talks about the ecology of Japan. What was once a beautiful; grassland has now turned into the Asian New York. That The Last Samurai had to be filmed in New Zealand to get a turn of the century Japanese look speaks volumes. The River God sequence is an unsubtle but unpretentious commentary on pollution. While these two themes are very much current in Japan, they are also universal themes  which makes 'Spirited Away' a universal story that most of us can connect with. I'm willing to bet everyone reading this has at some time seen bicycles lying on a lake bed or have had a child talk to them disrespectfully. Sure these themes aren't advanced philosophy. They are everyday issues told in an inventive, fun way.The animation is wonderful, if not as smooth as Disney's works  but there's something superior to that. 'Spirited Away's imperfect, but detailed world is far more fascinating than the perfected blandest of Disney's latest offerings. The animators successfully balanced the tight-rope between not-enough animation on characters and too much animation on characters. No Ralph Balski ADD antics here! The film is full of vivid images  both beautiful and horrifying. The line between those two extremes is crossed over seamlessly. From Chihiro and Haku running through an opening flower field to Haku's dragon snarling with a bloody mouth, both extremes seem to belong in the film. It's also excellently done with the characters. Kamaji can be seen as a scary, daunting figure at the beginning, but soon he seamlessly changes into a humble, wise figure. Yubaba also seems to be able to turn from kind to witch with the snap of a finger. The sound on the film was expertly done. The sounds perfectly match the on screen actions and objects. My sub woofer got a wonderful workout when Haku swoops Chihiro past the bridge at the beginning. And while I don't speak Japanese, I think the voice actors did a wonderful job of conveying their personality and emotions true their voice. Joe Hisaishi's music is sublime, definitely one of my favourite scores. His main piano theme is simple and evocative. His thunderous action music hits the viewers on the chest like a hammer. Like all great scores it heightens the greatness of a scene about three times. The score, unlike many American composers', is unobtrusive. It plays excellently with the scenes, but never overbears them. A lot of the time the it is barely noticeable, a sole piano plays softly in the background evoking a dreamlike/lullaby quality. 'Spirited Away' is a simply a modern masterpiece, easily one of the Top 10 films of the new millennium. It works on a multitude of levels; a social commentary on Japan, a homage to ancient Japanese/Russian mythology, a moral film for both children and adults. But most importantly, it is a simple story brilliantly told by a great filmmaker who appears to be at the top of his game. 'Spirited Away' works much like a relaxing journey. Pop in the DVD; leave this world for two hours and when you will be almost certainly enriched and ready to take the trip again.","

"planktonrules","11 June 2007","I have seen many international films over the years and quite a few of these were Japanese. In addition, unlike many parents, I have seen a lot of anime that my kids have watched so at least I have some familiarity with the medium. Yet, with my background I still felt pretty confused and baffled by the strangeness of this movie. Now this isn't to say I didn't like it, but so many times I just couldn't understand exactly what was happening. Interestingly, when I saw the film again, I understood it much better and appreciated it much more. And this may be exactly how you might want to approach the film unless you already are a die-hard anime fan. See it, but be willing to see it without trying to think out the odd plot too much or even try seeing it several times. I know that each time I did, the film became more and more enjoyable and I began to notice so many cultural references. Now, several years after I first saw it in the theater, I have seen a lot more Japanese anime and films and it's practically second-nature to follow the film. So, for adults and those unfamiliar with the medium, this movie might take a bit of effort to fully enjoy, though with more and more children being familiar with and loving anime, it's very likely your kids will love it and will then be able to explain it to you!! As for the film, the animation is the best I have seen in any Miyazaki film, the story deep and fascinating and it's full of cute and endearing little touches that make the movie magical. See this with an open mind, please.","

"shanebuckland","4 November 2002","There is simply no denying that Miyazaki is the Godfather of Japanese Animation, time and time again delivering works of such incredible beauty, such stunning visual and sensory delights, such mastery of storytelling, that one can only be left speechless. Overwhelmed. Intoxicated with wonder. Such is the magic of Spirited Away.Much like Miyazaki's previous feature Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away is an epic fantasy that deserves no better medium than the stunning animation work of Studio Ghibli. This multiple award-winning masterpiece has grown to become the largest grossing film in Japanese history, and rightly so. From the moment our child heroine Chihiro enters the bath houses we are literally bombarded with an overwhelming sense of detail and rich, lavish colours rarely - if ever - seen in Western animation. Scenes such as Chihiro running through the field of flowers, the marvellous landscapes seen from the train, Haku and Chihiro soaring the skies above, and Chihiro running across the pipe to climb the walls of the bath house are nothing short of breathtaking, and undoubtably some of the most lavish animation ever to hit the screen.The world of Spirited Away is bustling with life; unique, quirky, instantly lovable creatures jostling about their daily activities and tasks in the bath houses, dancing across the screen like leaves caught in a playful summer breeze. The inventiveness of Miyazaki's character designs is wonderful to behold, in fact not since classic tales like Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland and The Neverending Story have we been able to fall hopelessly in love with such original, quirky, magical, and fantastical characters. The viewer is plunged headfirst into another world for nearly two hours and one cannot help but be completely and utterly captivated.The music and original score is stunningly beautiful, the original Japanese language track of such high quality that one wonders why someone could insult the work by producing a dub track at all. With a plot differing in its complexity on so many levels, from the basic storyline to the omnipresent universal themes, to the riddling of Japanese history and fable throughout, children and adults alike will be mesmerised from start to end. A magical, awe-inspiring, tearful, laughter-filled, heartfelt journey through a land of sweeping fantasy and dreams. Prepare to be Spirited Away......","

"Balibari","18 October 2004","Last year I saw Spirited Away on it's UK release. I've never been a particular fan of anime, and it didn't really occur to me that I was watching a foreign language film dubbed into English (or 'American'). I can't imagine seeing a live action foreign language film dubbed into another language, but hey, this is a kids cartoon, what does it matter? Up to a point it didn't, because I loved the film. I enjoyed it so much I set about digging up the Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki back catalogue, in the process Sprited Away was filed away as one of the lesser Ghibli's - still great, but compared to Laputa, Grave of the Fireflies and a few others, it seemed a little weak. BUT... I recently re-watched it on DVD with the subtitles and found the difference unbelievable. The film came alive like the other Miyazaki's I've seen. It seemed infinitely more layered, detailed, intelligent and witty than I remembered. Could it be that retaining the intended performances (even if the words are unintelligible) can make that much difference? Maybe the dub was just poorly done? Or was it just because I was now versed in the language of Ghibli? As a little experiment I decided to re-watch some of the film with both the English subtitles and English language dub in order to compare, I ended watching the whole thing out of morbid fascination. It's simply amazing what a difference there is. Entire scenes change. It's not just that subtle emphasis is shifted or the same points are made in a different manner - in the dub, the subject of whole conversations and scenes are changed, and often to some flat and uninteresting hokum. Relationships between characters are changed, their motivations and personalities are changed, the difference is shocking. I appreciate western, and particularly American audiences can be put off by subtitles. And cinemas are less likely to show the film anyway. It's pointless to be all righteous when, fundamentally, you just want people to see the film. Unless they do, this treasure trove will remain undiscovered, and maybe finding it will encourage people to conquer the 'subtitle demon' (as Miyazaki might call him). But the problem is the quality of these dubs, and the liberties taken with the source material. Of course, without speaking Japanese, who can say it's not the subtitles that are way off? They're probably written by westerners too. But the dub just stinks of Disneyfication. Saturday morning generic nonsense. The challenging, uncompromising and emotionally ambitious nature of the film is severely watered down.A fair question might be, 'if it's so bad why was it so successful?' The success is evidence of the films staggering quality. Even so, it hardly challenged whatever Jerry Bruckheimer movie was showing at the time. In Japan it's the biggest grossing film in history. 'Go figure,' as Chihiro wouldn't say.","

"JWick23","18 December 2020","What did I just watch. Maybe it wasn't targeted for people like me but I watched it cuz this anime was highly praised and is considered a masterpiece so I decided to give it a shot.So enough with my rant let's into how I rated it. Music and visuals were absolutely amazing for this anime. I really enjoyed especially the character art and movement of the characters. The music had this aesthetic and calm feeling to it which I enjoyed.The problem occurs with the story and the characters. The story or the plot was hella confusing there is one thing and then pops another thing and then another just to get the water flowing and with no reason whats so ever. And the plot made like literally no sense whatsoever. The characters were alright but there were some confusing moments and decisions the characters made. The themes aren't exactly well shown and I didnt seem to find any or understand it well.But for all the problems I sort of enjoyed it I don't know why but it had this calm feeling as if you are dreaming. But I'm also the type of guy to not like a kid's movie or a fantasy movie with a few exceptions.Memorable: No Rewatchable: No.","

"rtsdynamite","28 July 2022","Spirited Away contains a great cluster of creativity. The characters and ideas are mostly original and the core design which is the main character's (Chihiro) coming of age tale, completes with satisfaction. Yet the film feels familiar. It shares the same magic that Disney's older pieces contain and it is executed with a Japanese approach which does make it different but it has the same purpose. Which is to simply encourage younger audiences into being brave and so on.That cluster of creativity also becomes a bit mindless when random things keep happening, there is absolutely no consistency with anything. Details are introduced and have next to no meaning, other than expanding the lore. The mysteries that are wrapped up in the opening scenes unwrap cluttered and without defining details. Im not completely in the directors head and i feel as if some things just happened for the fun of it. I was expecting a layered story with the exceptionally high rating, with every detail having depth and meaning. Without spoiling the film, greed is frowned upon and im sure that capitalism is questioned, with the abandoned old themepark reflecting the loss of the old era. Little things such as Bo having to become small to become a bigger and better being, with him able to stand as a result are things to take away from the film.I do however, simply believe that the West has blown this movie above its true level. Yes it is original, yes it has qualities but apart from its unique characters 'Spirited Away' is not a special film for me. Perhaps i am being too critical or perhaps i am just disregarding the 2001 release date which may bring some exceptional credit to it, of which i am not aware. I have seen cartoon films before and i have seen anime's, yes this is a perfect combination of the 2 for children. I really enjoyed some of the characters but felt the story came short but perhaps i have set the bar too high in a film made for children. 8/10.","

"DanLawson146","26 April 2020","POSITIVES:.There are shots in this film that deserve to be framed and put on your wall
.Chihiro's relationship with No Face pulls at the heart strings (especially the bath tokens scene)
.Chihiro's character journey from immature, spoilt brat to mature, strong woman is greatNEGATIVES:.From the incredible critical acclaim this film has I'm sure there are very deep themes but I clearly missed them
.Chihiro is very annoying at the start of the film and her parents are awful!
.The best plot twists are when the evidence had already been seen, just not pieced together. The twist in this film that Haku is really a river that saved Chihiro when she was a little girl comes out of absolutely nowhere and that is not a good plot twist
.Chihiro gets extreme prejudice in the bath house because she is human but plenty of other characters appear to be human but get no hate?","

"Foxbarking","2 May 2005","This movie is an outstanding piece of artwork. I hadn't heard much about it when it was first released. Being a huge Oscar fan, I was surprised when it took home the award for best animated film. At that point, knew nothing about it.After reading a little more and seeing some commercials, I still wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to see this film. It looked so surreal in an ""Alice in Wonderland"" sort of way. I had never been a big fan of that film and didn't really want to relive such an idea. Mindbending films have never been my absolute favorites.I went to see ""Spirited Away"" with a friend who was into anime. He hadn't heard much about it either, but was interested in seeing it in the theater. Since it had won the Academy Award, I decided it was a good idea to give it a shot.I am so glad I did. Only a very few times in my life have a I seen a movie as brilliant as this. It stands alone with such masterpieces like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""The Godfather"" and any other classic piece of cinema in history.I won't go into too much detail, but I was spellbound from the opening credits until the closing ones. The story starts out so rough and scary, but becomes a work of happiness and beauty. To think that this movie almost didn't get made is a travesty. It will stand the test of time and go out as one of the greatest films ever made.","

"Matti-Man","24 January 2005","That ""Spirited Away"" is a masterpiece would seem to any sane person to be beyond dispute. This is the first of Miyazaki's films I've seen and had it recommended to me by a friend who's into anime. I'm really not keen on Manga at all, so I delayed seeing ""Spirited Away"" for a few months. I finally got around to seeing the subtitled version - never, never waste your time with dubbed versions of foreign movies - over the weekend and I loved every frame of it. The imagination and creativity blew me away and I'd put the film alongside other ""children's"" masterpieces like ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"", Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy and Ray Bradbury's poetic ""Something Wicked this Way Comes""..However, in reading through the other comments for ""Spirited Away"" here I was struck by the huge chasm between the views of those who love the film and (the appropriately small minority of) those who don't.Even more striking is the strident hostility of those who don't like the film towards those who do. Critics here have called fans of the movie, ""liars to yourselves"", ""gushing"", ""flat-out wrong"" and the movie itself, ""inane"", ""unwatchable bilge"", ""muddled"", ""nonsensical"", ""gibberish"".Now I'd be scratching my head in puzzlement even if these commentators had blandly stated that this film wasn't for them, but this outpouring of venom had me completely perplexed.Another viewer states, ""The girl basically had to suffer for something even her parents didn't do wrong, they just wanted to explore things."" And here lies a glimpse of some possible explanations of why some folks don't get this movie. The whole point is the parents *did* do something wrong. They greedily ate food that wasn't theirs. Apart from being just plain rude, it's stealing. As another commentator here pointed out, you have to look at ""Spirited Away"" against the context of the culture that produced it. The Japanese are very concerned about the erosion of their traditional values, the lack of respect kids have for their elders, the breakdown of family cohesion and other ""negative"" ""Western"" influences on their traditional, polite, family-oriented culture. Perhaps we in the West have trouble with the concepts in ""Spirited Away"" because the influences that the Japanese audiences fear are the Western ""values"" that are being thrust upon them, values that we've grown up with and forgotten how to fear.Another critic commented ""I cannot see why this film is such a masterpiece to some people ... (though) my brother and I had a few good laughs, especially when Sen runs down the stairs and smacks into the wall. That was pretty funny, I must say."" This made me think back to when The Simpsons first started on TV - my daughter was three years old and she thought the funniest joke ever was when Maggie fell over. Now my daughter's a (very bright) 14 year old and these days it's the razor sharp satire of dysfunctional family life that makes her laugh out loud. QED. If someone isn't sensitive to the morals that are being examined in this film, then of course the film is going to seem pointless. However, as the film plainly does have more than one good point to make, perhaps it's just that these critics aren't capable of grasping any of them.But really guys (and you know who you are) don't take your frustration at not understanding ""Spirited Away"" out on those of us who do. It's not our fault you don't get it.","

"kraley","4 October 2002","Good morning. Last night I was able to catch the Disney US Release of Spirited Away ( originally The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro). This is another  Disney purchase of a Japanese hit. For those that don't know, Disney has a nasty habit of importing titles from Japan and then changing the story when dubbing films or creatively editing the endings or plot to ""suit American audiences"". Personally I think that's a travesty. So  whenever you go see the Disney release of a foreign film, realize the film you are watching may not be the 'same film' the rest of the world sees.OK, that aside, was it a good film? I deliberately did no research before seeing this film as I prefer to go into films with little or no expectations. All I knew was that the film was directed and written by Hayao Miyazaki, the same man responsible for Princess Mononoke ( a film released a few years back that I also enjoyed). In the case of Spirited away, I'm glad I did not know what I was getting myself into, otherwise I might not have come (and surprisingly, not for the reasons you likely assume).The film concerns a young girl and her parents who find an odd tunnel in the side of a hill while moving to their new home. Upon investigating the tunnel, they find a strange ""theme park"" on the other side devoid of inhabitants. Upon investigating the theme park, things are obviously very ""wrong"" (at least to the little girl- her parents seem woefully oblivious) and as it gets closer to sunset, things just get worse. Unfortunately, this is all the plot I am able to reveal without spoiling the uniqueness of this film.This is an 'adult-oriented' movie. It has some rather disturbing images and ranks among the weirdest films I have seen in my life. It's a bizarre amalgam of Wizard of Oz,The Neverending Story, Alice in Wonderland, My Friend Totoro, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and The City of Lost Children (just to name a few). This film is interesting from beginning to end even though the plot advances rather slowly. There is always some new thing to see or some truly bizarre thing to witness. The animation is above average but not as impressive as Mononoke (and even features several gratuitous CGI sequences).There is a great story and some great humor. I laughed more in this film than I have at any Hollywood 'comedy' in the last 5 years (and Spirited Away is not a comedy, it just has several good comedic breaks). No nudity. No Profanity. No 'gratuitous' violence. Some rather disturbing scenes of characters getting eaten alive (and some threats thereof) but even the eaten characters return unharmed later in the film.This is not really a 'family film' (and definitely NOT a ""kiddee film"") but it is something you can take the whole family to. Smaller children will not understand the story, but they'll like the visuals and enjoy the humor. Mid-teens might be a bit ""weirded out"" by the subject matter and the visuals and older teens and adults may be too jaded by American cinema to enjoy the film for what it is- a lavish fairytale from a foreign country. This film runs about 2 hours so leave the ""kidney-buster"" sodas at the snack bar. If you have to take a bathroom break, you WILL miss something and I assure you no friend nor helpful audience member will likely be able to adequately convey what it is you DID just miss.If you enjoy Anime or the bizarre, make an effort to see this film. Even if you don't normally like ""cartoon movies"", you might give this one a chance. It is not a 'casual moviegoer' film by any means and does rely on some thought from the audience to enjoy it. It will also likely be the oddest film you'll see this decade and you'll be sure to remember this film long after all the other 'disposable movies' have faded from your recollection. This film is receiving almost no advertising. I didn't even know it existed until I saw the poster tucked away in a corner at the theatre earlier this week. I hope Disney puts a little more effort into advertising this film's release because it is truly an original film and worthy of a large audience. Hopefully positive word-of-mouth will get this film the attendance it deserves.","

"minimeltheminx","11 October 2004","I really enjoyed this film-everything about it glows and shines in a gentle luminosity. This film, if you have seen some of Miyazaki's other work, is quite light. The characters are beautifully and lovingly created and the colouring and setting of this film is absolutely superb. This is a beautiful little film and I can't wait for the next feature from Hayao Miyazaki-he is better than Walt Disney.Miyazaki blends the characters and the environment very well together, and I can see that this would be enjoyed for people at many different levels. Miyazaki enjoys creating female heroines and I was pleased that Chihiro lived up to the expression and beauty of her predecessors-like Nausicaa from the Valley of the Wind. This is beautiful and I would advise anyone to take a look at it's scope and serenity, along with it's fast paced plot and of course, the dreamlike settings that make it truly wonderful.","

"TheLittleSongbird","5 April 2010","I love Studio Ghibli, and Spirited Away is one of my favourite films from the studio. This is coming from someone who was delighted by Howl's Moving Castle, blown away by Princess Mononoke, emotionally devastated by Grave of the Fireflies and touched by the simplicity of The Cat Returns all but to name a few. Spirited Away is a mystical, charming and truly enchanting animated fantasy, even with the long length and some slow moments. The animation is absolutely stunning, both the hand drawn visuals and the CGI graphics give an ethereal charm to the film. The characters move more than convincingly and the colours are beautiful. The music is also outstanding, I loved the simplicity of the piano and the drama of the more dramatic parts. The story is a pleasure, I know people have complained of some loose ends, but it is an original, touching and charming one I feel. I also loved the characters. Chihiro, voiced with real enthusiasm by Daveigh Chase, is sulky to begin with, but she is also brave and resourceful, traits I like in young heroines. Lin is kind and sympathetic, and Susan Egan who was also in Porco Rosso was unusually sensitive as the character. Jason Marsden is charming as Haku, and Suzanne Pleshette is perfect as the grotesque Yubaba and as her sister Zeniba. Overall, I loved Spirited Away, it is really charming. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"elpresidente-4","15 June 2020","I've been hearing good things about this movie for years and finally decided to watch it, but I didn't quite understood it. There are things that I liked, like the expressive way the main character was drawn, the overall color palette and backgrounds, maybe some points for the original setting, but with that, I can't think of what else good to say. From all the things I've heard I expected the movie to be very emotional, yet I failed to notice such thing. I had seen the black character with the mask used in memes on the internet so much, that I expected he would play a really important part in the story, but in the end he was nothing special. The story really confused me, some elements didn't make much sense to me, and the ending was pretty rushed, like they ran out of money and had to complete the movie fast. I don't know, maybe I have to study Japanese philosophy and symbolism to understand what is happening. Don't get me wrong, I kinda enjoyed the movie, I just wish it made more sense. It sort of reminded me of the movie ""labyrinth"", but that movie has a very good structure and story, and you always know what is going on and why. In conclusion, I think the movie would be appreciated more by children.","

"classicsoncall","15 August 2012","Quite often I'll use the IMDb reviews and ratings to recommend a film, and that was the case here. With a ranking in the Top #50 as I write this I was anticipating something really special but was left somewhat disillusioned when it was all over. Probably the biggest disappointment for me was the lack of a coherent story line, or more specifically, the way the story veered off in completely different directions as if it was being written while the filming was already in progress. Story continuity seemed unimportant, one such example would be Master Haku's insistence with Chihiro that she must persist in getting a job from Kamajii the Boiler Man and refuse to take no for an answer. Failing to do so so would put her in jeopardy with Yubaba, but Kamajii simply recommends that Chihiro request a job from Yubaba directly, which she does.There's also the instance when Chihiro, now Sen, recognizes the bloody dragon serpent as Haku. How did she know that, and more importantly, how does the viewer come to that same conclusion, other than Sen's say so? There was enough of this kind of stuff to bother me in terms of effective story telling.I would surmise that Japanese anime is directed specifically at teenagers and young adults, and that's OK, just as it was back in the Fifties and Sixties with the explosion of monster films a la Mothra, Rodan and Godzilla. But to elevate ""Spirited Away"" to the level of masterpiece as some would suggest is carrying things a bit far to my mind. Perhaps in terms of technical achievement, one would have a point. The film is beautifully made and quite colorful, and some of the concepts seem original like the bathhouse for the spirits, but overall I was left unimpressed. Perhaps this is an acquired taste or maybe I'm too old to appreciate the genre, but this film didn't really do it for me. But you know what, I watched ""Grave of the Fireflies"" and I thought that was more thoughtful and insightful, so I'm not closed minded about the whole thing. I guess I'll have to try some other titles to see what works for me.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","2 July 2023","I'd class myself as a casual viewer, someone who's trying to broaden my horizon of movies, anime is perhaps not kryptonite, I can appreciate them, I don't often enjoy them.Spirited Away however, is one of the best animations I've ever seen, there's an incredible imagination behind this, a deep and complex story, mixed in with some tremendous visuals.I did have to read a few articles regarding the plot about forty minutes in, as I had a fair idea, vhr couldn't quite work out all that was going on, however as it developed it certainly opened up, the latter stages definitely seemed to make more sense, but if you struggle with the first twenty minutes or so, my advice is to stick with it.Best of all for me, the visuals, I thought this film even after two decades, looks absolutely incredible, it's a beautiful film. I thought the music was terrific too, totally in keeping with the spirit and vibe of the film.I watched this with English subbing, and the voiceover actors did a fine job. I was advised to watch it in its original format, but I was missing too much of the wonderful animation.Every time I watch an anime I seem to enjoy, this one was up a notch however, this is a film I've tried to encourage others to watch.8/10.","

"WeAreLive","30 March 2020","Chihiro and her parents are moving to a small Japanese town in the countryside, much to Chihiro's dismay. On the way to their new home, Chihiro's father makes a wrong turn and drives down a lonely one-lane road which dead-ends in front of a tunnel. Her parents decide to stop the car and explore the area. They go through the tunnel and find an abandoned amusement park on the other side, with its own little town. When her parents see a restaurant with great-smelling food but no staff, they decide to eat and pay later. However, Chihiro refuses to eat and decides to explore the theme park a bit more. She meets a boy named Haku who tells her that Chihiro and her parents are in danger, and they must leave immediately. She runs to the restaurant and finds that her parents have turned into pigs. In addition, the theme park turns out to be a town inhabited by demons, spirits, and evil gods. At the center of the town is a bathhouse where these creatures go to relax. The owner of the bathhouse is the evil witch Yubaba, who is intent on keeping all trespassers as captive workers, including Chihiro. Chihiro must rely on Haku to save her parents in hopes of returning to their world.I watched this film twice once when I was 11 and just recently on netflix and what can i say it was a ride of fun.The characters are likeable, the visuals were good too.Overall it is a good movie recommended to both kids and adults.","

"sailvane-1","12 January 2005","Actually I dislike his or her comments badly. If you didn't get it watch it again. This is not a piece to just entertain, the creator has put his own feeling and I believe life experience and the fear always buried in children's mind into it. It is a comely tale that express the creator's thoughts in some way, whilst shining as a attractive animation piece with so many details that you might have ignore if you were careless. It is a rich story and I can see the efforts creators put into it in many spots and frames.e.g. While Chihiro was walking towards the garden where Haku told her to meet him, she passed some stairs where she can see an island, there are some house on it, she stopped for it for a little while, that, represents her longing to human world, her own world, this kind of details can be ignored by many people but they don't mind putting it in to make the whole story richer, more truthful, full of power of humanity.Apart from that, did you ever notice that some ""camera language"" was used very well to tell the story in a more entertaining and better pace.e.g. When Kamaji was telling Chihiro how Haku turned up to this world before just like what she did, the ""camera"" panned to where the little rat(changed from the fat baby)was showing off to soots by putting his foot into the spell melted print while Kamaji's introduction about Haku's background is also getting across to the audience. This is just one of the details that shows how much story telling skills and rhythm control of plots.There're many other things like this, shouldn't be ignored if you want to make a nice comment, even though as an American viewer you might miss a lot of the story by lack of the culture background, but that's not the reason that you can comment it as anyway you want without even really READ the film.I am a visual effects person and film maker but I can't tell where the jerking of the footage and the stopping of character's movement are in the film. could Gazzer please enlighten us? As also a fan of Pixar I hope I don't have bias on either American animations or Japanese ones, but as a Chinese who might have some resistance towards Japanese products for national esteem or historic reason, I still admires Ghibli Studio's work. ""Spirited Away"" is a masterpiece of elegant picture and touching story, if Gazzer-2 knows what that means.""Ice Age"" was a pretty cute one of Fox productions, but not good enough to compete with ""Spirited Away"" I'm afraid. And I'd laugh at the opinion that the story of ""Ice Age"" is much simpler hence Oscar committee didn't recognise it, actually I believe ""Spirited Away"" was beautifully hand-painted frame by frame while ""Ice Age"" had a giant crew in 3d animation and visual effects. I'm afraid Ice Age was the much more complicated one.","

"A_Kind_Of_CineMagic","31 October 2013","I apologise to the seemingly massive fanbase for these Miyazaki films but I find them totally over praised.I cannot see what people find so amazing about them. The scripts are totally banal and unnatural with nothing that makes me feel any emotion or humour. I find the dialogue boring and idiotic to be honest.Yes the animation is what must attract people mainly I guess but is it just me or is it no better than the weird cartoons I used to watch on kids TV in the 80s like Ulysees, City of Gold or Thundercats? I just would accept it as a kid in the 80s and it is not terrible but while quirky it is neither clever nor realistic nor beautiful. I am not impressed.The stories are mostly weird. In this case it is weird and unengaging for me. I cannot see why people rate it so highly. The characters are drab and cold or sullen and the script is nothing to get me interested at all. The kookiness is all that I can see to attract people. I feel it appeals to the kind of computer game playing, does not leave their bedroom type of geek who has not grown up. It is neither for children nor for adults which is my main disconnect I think. Just my opinion.","

"paul_mampilly","27 September 2003","As the rest of the Western world was amazed by the throngs of CGI animation, and the inside Disney jokes, Japanese audiences were given a chance to see what real animation was like. This movie was the first foreign film which grossed over 200 million dollars before it came over the US shores. It had beaten Pixar's Ice Age and Disney's Lilo and Stitch to get Best Animated Feature. Yet with all these facts and figures shown to us, does this movie live up to its hype. In a one word answer, YES!However there is no point of handing out the superlatives to a movie, without explaining what the movie is all about. In a nutshell, the movie is about a ten year old girl who is travels to a strange yet enchanting world, after her parents were morphed into pigs. This change of shape was produced by the evil witch, Yubaba, an nasty sorceress who rules over this paralell universe. To avoid detection, the ten year old girl, Chihiro has to work for Yubaba in her bath house. This is where she meets all kind of strange and wonderful characters, like the half man half spider Kamaiji, the mysterious little boy, Haku and many other characters. Though Chihiro had met all these people, her only wish is to go home and turn her parents back to their normal human selves. Watching this movie, has made me wonder why is this feature shown in very small arthouse cinemas and it is on pirate DVDs, when it should be easily shown on the multiplex cinemas. This is a truly amazing movie, whereby the whole story, transports oneself to their earlier childhood. I know that happened to me. Also the movie's animation was totally amazing, in ways that Pixar and Dreamworks would just die for. A good example of this is the flower scene. In conclusion, everyone should watch this movie, whether young or old, japanese or any other nationality, because at the end of the day, this will show you emotions that any other animations will not give you the chance to show.","

The animation is amazing for sure but the story feels really convoluted. I don't really understand what the ghost character with the gold was. I didn't understand what he was or what we wanted exactly. Maybe i'm missing something. Also their is a character that apparently is a human but also a dragon and then later turns out to be a river spirit? The f*#k?!?! There is no real deep meaning in the movie as far as I can tell. The main character is fairly static throughout the whole movie and doesn't really grow or learn anything (she is also quite annoying at times) Also I'm not totally sure what the target audience is supposed to be here. At times it feels like a family movie sometimes it feels like a creepy horror movie with scary looking characters. I don't really know who this movie is for. As I said not a bad movie, but the story feels all over the place and feels pretty pointless when all is said and done.","

"BA_Harrison","22 June 2013","As a huge fan of both animation and Japanese cinema, I have long felt more than a little embarrassed by my ignorance of celebrated director Hayao Miyazaki. Having tried to rectify this situation somewhat by watching the highly acclaimed animé Spirited Away, I no longer feel so bad about neglecting his work for so long: I found the film hugely undeserving of the glowing praise heaped upon it and I imagine it'll probably be quite a while before I tackle another of Miyazaki's 'classics'.Although Spirited Away is undeniably impressive visually, with stylish animation and imaginative design throughout, everything else about the film leaves A LOT to be desired, especially the trite story, in which a little girl, Chihiro, gets lost in a strange world and encounters a series of whimsical fantasy characters while trying to find her way home. It's The Wizard of Oz, but without the star quality of Garland, the amazing flying monkeys, catchy tunes, cute dog, and over-sexed dwarfs in garish outfits; it's Alice in Wonderland without the pungent whiff of opium; it's Labyrinth without the allure of a teenage Jennifer Connelly, the star power of Bowie, and the magic of Henson; it's Coraline, but.errr nowhere near as good (speaking of Neil Gaiman, it reminded a lot of Mirrormask, which also bored me to tears with its random, meandering narrative).","

Saying this is a ""kid's movie"" is like saying ANimal Farm is a kid's book.

Without that knowledge, it is impenetrable. I've lived in Japan, but except for the fact that my wife, Japanese with a degree from perhaps their #1 liberal arts college, could help me with reference's, I would've been scratching my head.

"michaelradny","20 October 2015","The beautiful looking work of Spirited Away will catch you breathless from the get go, but sadly the story will neither entice nor enthrall you enough to stay focused on what's happening. The films story feels rather surreal and incoherent, giving no indication to what and why characters do certain actions. It also fails at being anything near original, muddling up previously used stories and creating one big jumbled mess.Whilst the story of Spirited Away may be hard for some to understand, one cannot leave the film without praising the artwork. It almost makes up for a lack of a coherent storyline, but for the most part the story does leave you wanting to know more; but to know more about what's happening, not about what's going to happen.","

Hoku is slightly on the cold side. Plot doesn't even make much sense, if any. Her parents eat a bunch of food that isn't theirs and turn into pigs. I understand that much. I'm failing to understand why or how does Yubaba have that level of authority over everyone and how she makes people forget who they used to be and keeps them stuck with her that way. That whole thing makes very little sense. Though it's undeniably fun to watch how Chihiro finds her way out of there. Along with the hint of romance between her and Hoku, but that's just kind of awkward considering she's only 10.","

We ended up renting the DVD and watching it in English.  The sound, the voice of Chihiro in particular, grated our ears like nails on a chalk board. After watching it, we played around with the DVD and found the original Japanese soundtrack with English subtitles. Far more subtle and simply put, an AMAZING difference.So, I would suggest watching it in both languages.  English so that you can concentrate on the scenery (with the sound turned down low.  Really, the screeching and shouting in English is annoying). Then watch it in Japanese for the color and mood the dialog provides.","

"Juggertrout","21 June 2005","Spirited Away is my favourite Hayao Miyazi movie. It's a departure from his previous films (all of them wonderful), in the sense that this film lacks the themes so common in his other work: humans vs nature, large scale battles being the prime examples. All for the better I say, as it allows him to create something truly unique and stunning. The story revolves around Chihiro, a young girl who, on the way to her new house, stumbles into an abandoned amusement park and is soon transported into a magical world of spirits, gods and human-frog hybrids.The animation is stunning. Miyazaki truly sees animation as an artform. Many stand out scenes contain no dialogue at all, and are merely animated images creating surreal effects: Chihiro in the lift with the Radish spirit, Chihiro running through the flowers, and the final train ride, where our young protagonist takes a mysterious train journey across a sea, with her spirit friend, No Face. Nothing much happens, it's just simple, colourful, oddly unsettling, and lingers long after the film ends.The characters are also perfect, and add to strange storyline. There's Kamaji, the multi limbed boiler room operator, Yubaba, the evil witch, and her massive baby child. No Face is a peculiar spirit who turns feral when Chihiro is not around, and finally, Haku, a boy spirit, who shares an emotional scene with Chihiro towards the end of the film.Colourful, imaginative, interesting, and emotional. Spirited Away is a film you'll want to see time and time again. Buy it.","

It captures the feeling of being trapped in this alien world full of new places, new people, and strange legends and myths that you grow accustomed to overtime. Each character that the protagonist meets is in someway an archetype of a personality you confront as a child without knowing you're confronting them at first and draws upon those archetypes to craft a journey through what seems like a pit of despair at first until you begin to take more control of the situation, essentially ""growing up"". There are a few Japanese cultural quirks that drag down an other-wise stellar animated film, but it still shines as an exemplary childhood tale.","

"fjhuerta-2","15 June 2003","I might have a thing with anime. I have never understood / appreciated it. Ghost in the Shell, Akira, and now this movie... I can't seem to like it.As a matter of fact, I find the movies visually stunning - for a framed portrait, that is. Try to make the elements move, and you are greeted with the worst animation since ""Speed Racer"". It's a jarring thing, watching smooth CGI against badly animated characters and elements. That's something I'm willing to ignore - IF the story is compelling, that is.Akira and this movie (and Ghost, to a lesser extent) share a terrible characteristic: they both can't make themselves tell a story with any consistency whatsoever. As in Akira, where the filmmakers were unsuccesful trying to tell a multi-volume story in 2+ hours, it seems Spirited Away tries to hard to tell a deep story - one that has so many dead ends you end up thinking either every small story is a metaphor about something the filmmakers didn't feel the need to tell you, or that this movie is just a collection of beautiful sketches.As an example - why did Sen parents were turned into pigs? And why was she able to find them at the end of the movie? Why didn't she try earlier to do so? Why did Haku try to attack Sen? What was the importance of Sen knowing Haku from before? Why did Sen thought it was a good idea to return the seal to the witch' sister? And why was No-Face introduced as a character when he didn't add anything to the story? and...Maybe it's just me, and the story does make sense once you think of it, or get to know the rest of the directors' output. As it is, I find it hard to understand just what the movie was all about. Which is sad, since, in a way, I was really expecting to like this movie.","

"gnta53","10 September 2004","Mystical. Enchanting. A key to another world. There are so many ways to describe this movie. The movie focuses on a young girl who is trapped in a sort of ""spirit world"". When her mother and father are turned into pigs, young Chihiro has to save her parents before they're cooked and eaten. It may sound silly, but this tale has more to it than farm animals. When Chihiro is frightened, she runs off. When a boy finds her, he tells her that she must get a job at ""The Bath House"". A sort of retreat for spirits. But to do this, she must speak with Yubaba. The witch who rules The Bathhouse. After Yubaba agrees to give Chihiro some work. She takes her name away from her. And she is then called ""Sen"". While shes at the bath house, she is put under very hard work. I could say more, but that would be foolish of me. This is a great movie that I think people of all ages should see for themselves. Its an enchanting and heartwarming story that I've watched over and over again and have never gotten sick of it.

"cosmic_quest","6 October 2004","My previous experience with Studio Ghibli began and ended with 'My Neighbour Totoro' but upon seeing the fantastic 'Spirited Away', I feel as if a whole new world of anime and Hayao Miyazaki has just opened up to me. Until now, apart from the odd Disney flick and, of course, 'My Neighbour Totoro', I had long consigned animation to childhood but this film is a perfect example of how how rich and diverse even an animated film can be.'Spirited Away' centres on ten-year-old Chihiro, a little Japanese girl who accidentally stumbles upon the Spirit World while exploring a mysterious passageway with her parents. When her parents are turned into pigs for stealing food, it falls to young Chirhiro and Haku, her guide in this strange new world, to save them before they become bacon. Not only are the characters well-depicted and engaging (with a few adorable little creatures added in to gush over!) but the story is very involving. During Chihiro's quest, not only do we see she and Haku grew as characters but we learn much about Japanese mythology and the moral of how not everything is as it seems. The atmospheric and other-worldly quality of the film leaves the audience feeling as if they too have joined the young heroine in this strange new land where the impossible seems possible.Although this film will no doubt appeal to young children who will easily identify with Chihiro, there is a dark air to 'Spirited Away' that will draw in teenagers and adults. Certainly, older viewers will be left awe-struck by the intelligence and strength of the plot and the characters. Highly recommended to anime fans and those who are just looking for a film that is unique and interesting.","

Chihiro's mother and dad don't think twice and start to eat the food there, what Chihiro refuses to do. The night falls and that abandoned city become full of strange beings and spirits, and when Chihiro runs to her parents to go out of that place she discovers that they become pigs. A mysterious boy called Haku helps her and explains the situation to her,saying that she needs to get a job in the spa hotel for spirits and gods from Japan. The work is hard, but Chihiro does well. The problem now is to find a way to break the spell of her parents and go out from that strange ghost city...This anime is very different from the animes I already watched. The story is very touching and truly unique, with another world inside the world we know. I would love to watch an anime series based in chihiro's life in the ghost's world. Hayao Miyazaki has my profound admiration, specially because ''Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi'''is not the only movie he did that I love: I also enjoy a lot ''My Neighbor Totoro ''. Of course that I think that this movie is totally worthy of the Oscar it received. By the way, the idea that Chihiro and Haku could forever stay in Yubaba's possession if they forget their real identities is very interesting to me,since it is a reality: if you loose your identity and forgets who you really are, your interests and your focus, you become lost in the world. The maturity of Chihiro is another easy thing to see, and adds another interesting understanding of the story.","

"jediknightcub","8 November 2002","The word masterpiece is being thrown around a little bit too much on this one.While I found myself stunned by the visuals in Spirited Away (particularly a magnificently realized train ride across the sea), its lackluster story - little more than a rip-off of (or homage to) Alice In Wonderland - keeps this film from being a classic masterpiece.Some of the ideas were extraordinarily imaginative (the spirit bathhouse, Haku's transformation into a dragon, Yubaba's transformation into a bird, the boiler-room operator), others were just downright ridiculous (No-Face's regurgitation, the bouncing disembodied heads, the baby, an evil twin sister - what is this Days Of Our Lives?).This is not to say that I was expecting literal-minded filmmaking.  I was thoroughly impressed by the director's previous film, Princess Mononoke, but I felt its story was integral to its success (i.e. a hero's journey; the forces of human industrialization vs. nature and the need to co-exist peacefully).  The ""story"" in Spirited Away is much more simplistic (girl overcomes her fears) and, as a result, leaves little in the way of narrative thrust or suspense (especially for a 2 hour movie).  Princess Mononoke's story was epic and its running time and pace justified.  Spirited Away is merely serviceable in every way except its visual palette.","

"pip-7","3 May 2005","It is so ironically tragic that many great movies such as Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away are often overlooked by the public, suggesting that commercialism is the way of reflecting the possibility of achieving blockbuster status in the box-office, even as if most of these recycled products receive poor reviews (remember Shark Tale? It's horribly cliché but millions of viewers still watch it). Is it because of technology that drives its influence to the public without providing any necessity that is its substance? Or is it because Spirited Away is considered another ordinary 2D cartoon that should be suitable for little children and not the rest of us? Sadly, this is reality and we all see as it is right now (providing that we live in a topsy-turvy world with unfair paradoxes) but it doesn't mean that Miyazaki's masterpiece has a chance to change our reflections on life. In fact, there are doses of good reasons on why this movie is so special to us, aside from its family-friendly context.Hayao Miyazaki, who has directed many of the most acclaimed animated movies in animation history (under the banner of Studio Ghibli), has stated that Spirited Away is 'for the people who used to be ten years old and the people who are going to be ten years old'. Perhaps, he really knows how children see things in their own eyes, as he might use to face during his childhood times (that's why most of his movies feature flying ships/creatures, tons of imaginative elements derived from Asian/Western cultures, some preferences from classic fairy tales, etc.) Most importantly, Mr. Miyazaki uses this tagline as an essential plot device to show the innocence, the bizarre, the horror and the wondrous revelation that the main protagonist (Chihiro) sees, feels and experiences throughout her spiritual journey, a path that we all had crossed as children before the madness of the world overwhelms our innocence. Fortunately, movies like Spirited Away succeeds in regaining our former consciousness, pulling us into his imaginative world where our childhood memories have never died; they are merely hidden inside our hearts and Mr. Miyazaki is enable to reshape them with everything this movie has to offer.Instead of the cliché-ridden plots that mar state-of-the-art-animated films of today, Mr. Miyazaki refers to his personal experience in Japan as another plot device while maintaining the classic storytelling technique to create an entirely refreshing concept based on real-life situations. If you think Spirited Away features some of the most incomprehensibly bizarre characters you've never seen, fear not! Like all good movies, despite their oddity, they all are no different from us in terms of how they adapt to life and their functions to keep the company going. That also leads to the fact that Spirited Away is really not a good vs. evil show (like Star Wars); despite its scary images, powerful spells and evil-looking monsters, they are all surprisingly ordinary with mere characteristics of maids, bosses and customers. So don't expect a Darth Vader-like antagonist to cover the whole world with darkness while unleashing a large army of robotic troopers to destroy everything in their sights.The overall animation is simply breathtaking. Even as they are all hand-drawn, the characters' expressions and body postures are all wonderfully done in a very natural way, the same applies to these beautiful background settings painted painstakingly by some of Ghibli's most talented artists in Japan. Speaking of animation, when watching it up close and personal, it does bear some resemblance to Disney's Snow White as well as his classic movies (unlike the new, recycled Disney movies of the early 2000s) in terms of its cel-shaded look and the way most characters move and interact (strangely, though, Mr. Miyazaki is not a big fan of Disney. Ironically, Disney is the only company that understands his movies' significance to moviegoers around the world, so it serves as a distributor to Ghibli's animated movies in North America.). Unlike most current anime that requires CGI to excite the audience, Mr. Miyazaki fortunately decides not to rely much on fancy digital applications (there are some subtle CGI effects, which are cleverly implemented on certain parts of the movie).Disney, in its other matter, has done a good job in translating the movie's original Japanese context to its English counterpart without radically changing the flow and theme of its entire story, thanks to Pixar animator and executive producer John Lasseter (however, Disney's marketing power fails to attract more moviegoers). Despite the audience's varied reactions on English and Japanese tracks, in my opinion, I find both of them outstanding and seem to have a natural pattern to influence the mood of the movie. Once again, Joe Hisashi, the composer of many of Miyazaki's movies, has provided some of the finest and most memorable cues ever to bring grace to the screens (one of my personal favorite is a cue in which Haku finally remembers his original name, shedding its scales in the sky). Without these important audio elements, Spirited Away could have been another uninspiring, lifeless show.It is no doubt that Spirited Away has indeed changed the way we look at animated movies, similar to the way the original Star Wars trilogy, the first two Godfather movies and films by Steven Spielberg did. It is also true that whatever I write in this review, a single picture tells a thousand words; you still need to watch it with your own eyes, feel it as you are still a child and you will understand a thousand reasons why this movie should receive an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. However, like many artistic filmmakers, Mr. Miyazaki is not interested in such glamorous spotlights and moneymaking propaganda, as he continues to inspire newer generations with his latest waves of masterpieces, starting with Howl's Moving Castle.Thank you, Mr. Miyazaki for proving once again that childhood memories will forever endure within our hearts and souls until the end of time.","

"PIST-OFF","19 April 2021","So as of this review Spirited Away is ranked as #28 on the imdb's top 250 movies of all time. This means it out ranks Vertigo, Taxi Driver, Casablanca, Back to the Future, Apocalypse Now, Memento, Paths of Glory, Das Boot, Citizen Kane, Reservoir Dogs, A Clockwork Orange.... and countless other highly prestigious films. Also as of this writing I've now watched a dozen youtube analysis of the film, read a few article, read a dozen professional critical review, and read a fair number of the 10 star ratings on imdb.I'm gonna say right off, I don't get how this is ranked so high. The story, even accounting for the idiosyncrasies of Japanese culture which I admittedly do not understand, was still an absolute mess of flitting from one oddball situation to the next with sometimes little or no connection to what seems to have gone before. The human characters at the beginning act in ways which never make sense and then were off into a magical world where whatever needs to happen next happens.Many of the people who don't like this movie will fall back on how good the animation is..... to me it's no more or less than other animation that came way before it. In addition, to describe the animation as beautiful is kind of disingenuous or at least not quite accurate as many of the things being animated are quite repulsive. Instead it would be more accurate to say that the animation is a series of lovingly detailed grotesqueries. The Yubaba character is quite unpleasant to look at throughout the film.So, on and on this goes. After half an hour in I thought I'd been punk'd or something. But as the movie plods through one bit of nonsense or the next.... nothing seems to add up. The plot so to speak follows the formula of a video game where a character must accomplish this to recieve this prize which must in turn be used to accomplish the next thing which unlocks the next mission. It was tiresome.For years I've said that 12 Angry Men is the most highly overrated film on the imdb top 250. This movie may give it a run for it's money. If beyond all the reviews and analysis I've read there's something I'm not seeing, I invite anyone to explain what is there. I could be wrong, or this could be an ugly senseless bit of mass delusion. If there was a zero stars available, I would give it that.","

"subscriptions","7 September 2006","I am baffled by how much people like this pointless and annoying movie. The protagonist is an irritating and uninteresting little girl, and the film has essentially no plot. It presents a series of weird encounters and situations, without ever a sense that it's going anywhere, and without ever showing an interesting way of dealing with them by the little girl. Rather, whatever she does happens for magical reasons to have been the right thing, giving the impression that we're watching her have one of those dreams in which she can do no wrong. For some reason people like this parade of strangeness without a plot or a likable protagonist enough to rate this film higher than Grave of the Fireflies and Princess Mononoke, excellent films that actually have great characters, compelling plots, and in the latter case, also very imaginative encounters and situations.","

"Christopher_Reid","10 June 2007","Spirited Away has all the elements of a great film but one. It doesn't seem to know what it's really about; there is no apparent focus or purpose. Clearly Chihiro is the main character in the movie (unless you count the world she discovers as a character or something like that) and yet her emotions and thoughts are given little attention. Most of the time she simply appears to be mildly confused. Although I could relate to her, I couldn't relate to her reaction to the world she finds herself in.I liked the idea of Chihiro adapting to her situation and becoming stronger in the process but she never seems to become critical of how illogical her new world is. Characters appear to randomly alternate between mean and nice, wise and stupid, important and insignificant. This would be okay if Chihiro's character was explored more deeply, but it isn't. The lack of Chihiro's development would be okay if the world was more meaningful but it isn't. This is just my opinion of course, perhaps I'm missing the point of the movie completely. This makes it very difficult to criticise - it just doesn't work but for a plethora of reasons.On the plus side, the score by Joe Hisaishi is magnificent, the animation is superb, and the film has some redeeming moments towards the end. I can't help but wonder what a fantastic film it might have been. I think a comparison with Alice in Wonderland would help me pinpoint my problem with it. The stories are very similar and where I found Spirited Away frustrating, Alice in Wonderland is entertaining and even thought provoking. Although Alice's world is very odd, it is also quite funny. Chihiro's world is too mean and serious to be funny. In fact, maybe that simple distinction summarises why I don't adore Spirited Away. I don't know. Another significant difference is that Alice actually gets frustrated and appreciates how ridiculous her world is at times.In summary, if you take Alice out of Alice in Wonderland you get a silly pointless movie. If you take Chihiro out of Spirited Away, it makes little difference because of her lack of presence (excepting some later parts) and you get a silly pointless movie. So Spirited Away is too close to being a silly movie when it could have been enchanting and entertaining.EDIT: I revisited this and found I liked it even less. Yes, the music is certainly beautiful. In fact, I think that's why people forgive it. But that can't make up for a bad story.Like Alice or Dorothy, Chihiro finds herself in a strange, magical world. But as I said, that world itself is not very interesting. It's arbitrary, mean, frivolous, etc.Alice and Dorothy encounter colourful characters who exaggerate the kind of people we find in real life. Those movies give us insight into human behaviour and attitudes. Weaknesses like being illogical, selfish, cowardly, lonely, stupid, etc. But there are kind and wise characters as well. There are contradictions for the main character to notice and learn from.But Chihiro is blank. And the characters come and go too quickly. They're also annoying. A mute monster that eats people. Why? I'm not interested in a pretentious exercise in making up my own interpretation. There's a giant baby, literally. Three bobbing heads. An ugly old witch. People who look like frogs. None of them are remotely appealing, funny, likeable or even enjoyable as villains.The ending is random. Why does Chihiro suddenly know how to recognise her parents? Why is the boy suddenly a water dragon? How does that change anything?Chihiro's parents were already neglecting her and acting like pigs before the main story starts. That works against the message of the movie. Imagine if Dorothy's parents and neighbours were mean to her. It would just complicate the movie and make ""there's no place like home"" sound sarcastic. What is Chihiro so excited to return to? Her dad still ignoring her and walking off?Also, the animation isn't that special. It's not on the level of Disney, either back in the 1930s-1950s or in the 1990s. Not even close. Some moments are nice, but there's often little movement. Or the movement is on a cycle.Some comedy with Chihiro lifts the film a little bit. And again, the music soars. But this is perhaps the most overrated movie on IMDb in my opinion. And such a shock compared to My Neighbour Totoro which I think is wonderful and very insightful.","

"tomimt","2 February 2005","Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi, or Spirited Away as the name is translated, is probably the best animated movie I've seen for a while.Summary of the story: Young girl Chihiro is is moving with her parents, when they stop for a while at place, which her father describes as old amusement park. But soon it is visible, that this place is no ordinary amusement park. When sun sets Chihro's parents turn into pigs and spirits, ghosts and ancient gods start to roam around in a place ruled by old witch Yubaba. Chihiro must rescue her parents and herself from eternal slavery in Yubaba's bath house.Not your typical Disney cartoon. And that is a compliment. No ready chewed, easy to point up moral codes, but more real grip from things. A line between good and bad is very vague line. Is Yuababa really a evil witch or is she just greedy old woman, who can learn from her mistakes? Do all bad deeds bring more sorrow, or can they sometimes bring something good? Chihiro grows, really grows during the story. She begins from a wimpy little girl and ends up to be brave, selfless girl, who ends up saving more --hmmm-- I think entities would be proper word in this case.But Chihiro is not the only one growing during the story, there is also a nameless spirit named no-face, who ends up finding peace thanks to Chihiro.There is also a young boy, Yubaba's apprentice Haku, who doesn't know who he really is. Yubaba is using Haku as a tool against her twin sister Zeniba.It is rare, that a single movie contains so much material. It is even more rare to see animated movies with such depth.Also for the acting, it's top notch, as is the animation. All backgrounds and characters are done with detail and passion.I really feel, that this is one of those must see movies for all animation fans.","

"bob the moo","21 September 2003","While on their way to their new house in a new town, Chihiro and her parents take a short cut down a side road and come to a dead end with a dark passage way in a wall.  Despite her fears, Chihiro goes with her parents to see where it leads.  They come out in open space where they find what looks like an abandoned theme park.  Chihiro's parents find a stall with lots of food prepared and start to eat while Chihiro refuses and goes to investigate a working bath house.  As it suddenly gets dark she goes back to her parents to find they have been turned into pigs and suddenly shadows draw over the stalls.  Chihiro hides with the help of a boy called Haku.  He helps her to stay in the bathhouse by getting her a job (as dictated by Yubaba) and she settles into the resort for Japan's gods and spirits.  However she still must work out a way of getting her parents back before they grow fat and are eaten.The first I had heard of this film was when it won the Oscar (sadly this was the one part of my combination bet that I had got wrong and hence won nothing).  Since then the film has had world-wide promotion and arrived in the UK several years after it had first been shown.  Despite the worrying `Walt Disney' legend at the front of the credits, this is very much a Miyazaki film and the mouse has not turned it into something else.  My second worry was that the American team involved in the version I saw would bring out sarcasm in the same way as they (Lasseter) does in things like Monsters Inc etc.  I enjoy that style of humour but `Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi' was much better than just that.The plot involves the quest to recover Chihiro's parents from a spell that made them pigs, but the world in which the film is set is what makes it so enjoyable.  The world is imaginative and filled with all sorts of characters. Chihiro's journey explores themes of understanding, trust and friendship  all around the central quest, and in this way it is good that some parents I know have been taking their kids to see this film even if it isn't tied into a Happy Meal marketing campaign.  The characters are all pretty well developed and are interesting.  Chihiro is afraid but brings bravery from inside herself, Haku is a mystery but appears trustworthy, the mysterious noface could be a friend or foe.  What the film doesn't have is characters who do nothing  they all drive the story forward or provide the comic relief in some way.The American cast do good jobs dubbing the characters.  Usually dubbed films are so poor that I always seek out subtitles, however here the job was as it were meant.  Chase is very good in one of her two Oscar nominated films that year and Mardsen has much more to do than in the X-Men films!  Support voices are all good and involve plenty of recognisable voices such as Chiklis, Holly, Ratzenberger and Stiers.The film is a lot more accessible than much anime  sure there are still monsters and spirits but there are no major battles and way out visuals to deal with, kids can watch this (and should).  In fact I did quite like the simplicity of the tale.  Whereas kids movies recently tend towards the more sarcastic, cruel humour as much for adults, here the film is more about spirit (no pun) and moral courage.  It is also worth noting that, although there is magic, this is not some spectacle film like Harry Potter  Chihiro uses her brain and her heart to deal with things, not spells.The animation is fantastic  while CGI has been used, it never feels as totally computerised as Monster Inc etc does.  This isn't BETTER because it was hand drawn but it does fell a lot warmer and a lot more recognisable in terms of style.  The use of both techniques gives much to the look of the film.  As always the world and the characters come to life on the screen and are fantastic, creepy and beautiful all at once.I don't mean to gush but I did enjoy this film for all it's simplistic plotting.  The quest is a straightforward plot device and would be a problem if that's all this film had to offer.  Happily the central story is supported by characters who are wonderfully drawn (both animated and developed) and set in a world that is visually impressive and imaginative. I looked at my watch and wondered where two hours had gone.","

"silentcheesedude","27 February 2005","Upon hearing that this became Japan's highest grossing film ever, I went out of my way to look for a theater that had this movie here in the states. I traveled some, paid top dollar for the ticket, and, after seeing it, was totally blown away by the experience I had. I had no doubt in my mind that I have seen the best movie of the year, and quite possibly the best animated movie I have EVER seen.The story starts with a young girl named Chihiro, and her family, moving to a new place. When they wander into what seems like an abandoned theme park and her parents start to eat prepared food (but with no one around to attend them), they turn into pigs. Chihiro runs and encounters a bathhouse for the gods and spirits. With the help of a young boy named Haku, Chihiro learns that in order to reverse the effects of her parents dilemma, she must work in the bathhouse. Life isn't easy, not even for the gods. She'll come across bizarre creatures & places. She will learn hard work, the sense of loss, greed, & the importance of friendship and love.It's dreamy-like quality, it gorgeous scenes, and it's incredible list of characters (frogs that talk, a dragon, a baby that is 12 feet tall, a multi-armed boiler-room man) will keep you glued to the story. Children will love this film, yet it is sophisticated enough for adults to enjoy and relish in it's beauty. It does have it's scary bits and images, however, so very young children may be frightened. But this is still the type of movie that you go out and buy, even if you don't have children. So imaginative is the world that Chihiro falls in, thoughts of 'Alice in Wonderland' & 'The Wizard of Oz' may come to mind. But 'Spirited Away' ends up with it's own originality. It's a timeless piece, and will eventually be a classic that will no doubt be shown to generations.In the DVD, Disney made sure that the voice acting for the English version is top-notch, but, even if you don't liked dubbing, you have the option to switch to Japanese with subtitles.How could 'Spirited Away' become the first anime film to be nominated for, AND WIN an Academy Award? How did it gross $200 million before it even came to the states? The answer lies in mastermind creator Hayao Miyazaki. So well known in Japan, he is now getting the recognition he deserves internationally. With past hits like Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki and his studio, Ghibli, have created outstanding features that very few animation studios can even match. Their movies are hand-drawn, without all the CGI that many studios are using. Amid the fact that Disney has distributed these treasures, I would say that there isn't much in the Disney vaults that can even come close to matching what Miyazaki and his studio have produced.Do not hesitate to watch this magical, enchanting, and rare gem that we have the privilege to see. And if you have seen it, go out of your way to view the rest of Miyazaki's films, like 'Nausicaa', 'Castle in the Sky', & 'Kiki's Delivery Service'.Undeniably a perfect 10 out of 10","

"iamanoob0","20 June 2021","I still can't figure out if this movie is a troll on the internet and everyone is pretending to think it's the best animated movie ever or if I'm missing something big. Because I just wasted 2 hours of my life since I was baited into believing that a movie with an 8.6 on IMDB may actually be accurate. I really wanted to enjoy this movie, I practically forced my family to watch it with me saying that it is the highest rated animated movie of all time. My whole family wanted to quit halfway through but I told them that there had to be something at the end that carried this movie, but no, there was nothing. No emotion, no plot twist, just a ""and everyone lived happily ever after"". I can tell from the some hundred of thousands of reviews that hardly anyone will agree with me. The only points I can give this movie is that the animation is somewhat decent and that there were some funny parts, but that is it. I also get that this movie age range is mainly for kids, but even my 7 year old brother hated it. I just don't understand what people get from watching this movie, I just came out wanting to forget everything I just suffered through. I know my review was long but I just needed to get my thoughts out and hope that people see this and may decide to not watch this movie. You can like Spirited Away but I will forever remember this as the worst animated movie I have ever experienced.","

"Elise_Graham","22 September 2003","All I can say about this film is. . . I cannot see why this film is such a masterpiece to some people.  Answer me this.  They take so much time to do detailed back grounds, which are beautiful, but are hidden by the grotesque characters that seem to all look the same to me, no matter what kind of anime.  I found myself being lost in the plot several times, with very poor character development, and apparently hyperactive dubbing.  What I mean by that is, how come everything they say, not matter what it is, comes out all in one rushed, messy breath.  Though, I did find this movie rather a comedy. My brother and I had a few good laughs, especially when Sen runs down the stairs and smacks into the wall.  That was pretty funny, I must say.  The only reason why we went to the movie in the first place was because my brother recieved credit extra credit for his college class for watching it. What a waste of over 2 hours of my life!  I could have been sharpening pencils, or making paper airplanes! Also, I found that there were characters that seemed to play no part at all.  Example:No face.  Ok, so he is the bad guy for about, 5 minutes, but then has no real purpose for being in the movie.  What is with that guy anyway.  Eeesh!  I have nightmares about that one. . . In conclusion, I just want to say, that through out this on going movie, I was ended up multipul times getting lost and confused.  My eyes also started to hurt after watching the choppy animation move across the screen.  I give this movie, on a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being the worst, 5 being the best, I gets a big, fat 1, or maybe a zero.  No, one.  I liked the backgrounds and things that they actually spent time on. . . It is too bad Disney had to take part in this film. . .","

The history line has no head or feet, the escatological scenes get tiresome, the ending is facile and predictable and even hurried. In general it reminds one of the countless drivel that Manga aficionados are so fond of, one more of the apparently unending carbon-copy characters that we have got used to.The movie has a hint of pretentiousness that never really catches on, at the end is more of the same weird idiomatics that every single manga caricature has used to the point of exhaustion: the perfect girl with no fault on her character, the absent parents, the hero that saves her (and that in a convoluted turn of events has saved her before) and the loads of wackos that look mostly repulsive.It is an OK movie for children with strong stomachs (I wonder if their attention could be fixed for this long) but as a cinematographic experience it lacks all the ingredients of a respectable movie.","

There mom and dad transform into pigs because they ate the forbidden food and Chihiro has to take a job in the local spa, run by the old lady Yubaba, in order to transform them back. She gets a new name, Sen, and meets a nice boy Haku...------- ""Spirited Away"", Hayao Miyazaki's 8th feature length anime film, is an interesting fantasy parable. It does have poetry ( a magical scene in which Chihiro is falling from the sky, making her tears fall up ) and some analysts claim that the story is actually a symbol of child prostitution or child slavery in Asia, but as a whole the overlong movie doesn't always work perfectly and it seems as if the critics are finding more meanings which they want to find than the ones that are really there. If Miyazaki's earlier films were less ambitious ( with which I strongly disagree - i. e. ""Kiki's delivery service"" was a wonderful tale about growing up ), then his new ones are less fun and coherent. Miyazaki finally won an Oscar for this, but more thanks to his previous reputation than thanks to the good, but somewhat over-hyped anime ""Spirited Away"".Grade: 6/10","

"FilmOtaku","9 November 2003","I will admit hesitation in viewing the latest Miyazaki film, simply because of my own close-minded first impression of it.  Historically, I can appreciate the beauty and artistry in all of his films, but I find that I prefer the films that center more on characters (Kiki's Delivery Service, Whispers of the Heart) as opposed to animals and nature (Mononoke Hime, Porco Rosso).  Therefore, after seeing that this film was more fantasy than reality, I was not in a hurry to see it. Unfortunately, this meant that I missed out on having seen a masterpiece for several months.  Spirited Away, the story of a little girl who must somehow escape from a world inhabited by fantastical characters is as much about her own evolution and strength in character as it is about the incredible creatures that surround her in her new environment.  While Spirited Away is a fairy tale, it is also a lesson in accountability, strength and responsibility. 	 Miyazaki is known for creating strong young female characters that are also completely adorable, but Spirited Away contains some of the most interesting co-stars I have seen in recent memory.  A lamp that not only provides a guiding light, but also happens to hop along on one foot, a giant baby and a bird with the head of an elderly lady are just three of the many eccentric characters we experience.  Not only are the characters and story line rich, but the artistry is absolutely beautiful as well.  The colors and character design are flawless and awe-inspiring.  Even I, the cynical and technical viewer found myself saying `Aww' and smiling at the little soot monsters and the `mouse'.  The hype was worth it and the Oscar was well-deserved.  Spirited Away is a beautiful film that really and truly should be experienced, and has the potential of being enjoyed by most, because it has so many layers and imaginative aspects that there will be points of appeal for just about anyone.--Shelly","

"grantss","12 April 2015","OK, as a kid's movie. Otherwise, fairly dull. Plot is random, and really amounts to nothing more than Alice in Wonderland with more far-out creatures and less structure and point.Animation is so-so. Has the look and feel of kids TV series I saw in the 70s and 80s.I really don't know what the fuss is all about. If you want a great animated movie, ideal for all ages, watch ""Up"" instead. The Toy Story series (esp #3) would work too.How on earth this got into the IMDb Top 250, and, even more, the top 40, I do not know.","

"goatrealm","25 October 2003","a morbid curiosity usually compels me to finish watching movies that are dull and pointless, but PRINCESS MONONOKE's lack of interestingness had me reaching for the 'eject' button halfway thru. after hearing some of the accolades heaped on SPIRITED AWAY, i thought i'd give miyazaki another spin, and, boy, was i sorry.the movie's moral lessons veer toward the obvious--nothing groundbreakingly profound here--and are presented in an overly drawn-out fashion. here's an incomplete listing of SPIRITED AWAY's nice sentiments:a) don't be a glutton. b) care about your friends. c) look after your parents. d) do not value money above human (or inhuman) relationships. e) work hard, despite the drudgery of it all.now, the story is supposed to impart these valuable lessons by putting the protagonist in a dreamworld setting, where other, more twisted lessons are inextricably (and inexplicably) presented. whether intentional or not, the movie also implies:a) one should trust strangers who lounge about, even if they eat people and later regurgitate them. jeffrey dahmer, anyone? b) one should make pacts with evil persons to get what one wants. c) parents are pigs, and children must will be their salvation. d) people who try to do good things for you now might have done good things for you in the past (perhaps even a past life?), so go ahead and trust them--your instincts will guide you.well, so much for the beautifully inspiring movie everyone seems to be gushing about. . . .speaking of beauty, i never found the animation that impressive: the same jerky, low-frame-rate presentation that plagues japanese anime is found here. (i did enjoy, though, the transformation of the witch into her airborne self--that was the movie's funkiest moment.)and the nonsensical array of creatures inhabiting the world of SPIRITED AWAY reminds me of george lucas at his inane worst.i don't think i'll ever have the itch to watch another miyazaki film again; the dullness and vapidity are just excruciating.","

"Boba_Fett1138","10 January 2006","What makes this movie so powerful and great are mainly its characters. The characters are well constructed and are mainly the reason why this movie is so unforgettable. Some of the characters are quite odd looking, even by anime standards but they are so wonderfully constructed that they all become believable.The story is just totally brilliant. It's odd but oh so beautiful. The imaginary world gives the movie a totally unique and beautiful look and feeling. It all helps to make ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" an unique and unforgettable viewing experience. The beauty in the movie is in its unpredictability. Because its so unique and original, you never know what to expect next and everything comes as a pleasant surprise. My only complaint about the story is its love-story, if there even was meant to be one, wasn't really believable and felt underdeveloped and like a missed opportunity.It all is beautiful animated and with lots of eye for detail and I'm talking about both the characters and the imaginary world. It helps to make you believe in the totally imaginary world and the story.The musical score by Joe Hisaishi is just fantastic and fits the movie very well.This is once more another Hayao Miyazaki masterpiece. Once more he has succeeded in creating a unique, original and totally believable world, story and characters. It's both beautiful and unforgettable.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"Dark Raven","21 September 2003","Why?  Why do so many people hold this very average film on such a high pedestal?  Being quite a big fan of Anime I'm not new to the genre.  This was a serious head f***.  I will say the production design, use of color and music score were amazing.  However, in terms of plot, story structure, catharsis, plant and pay off...it's all over the place.  I felt the world had no rules to it and therefore lacked any real tension.  I felt the story lacked any logic to it and therefore had no reason behind the motivation for characters.  Why did she do that? What is that supposed to be?  What was that all about? When will this end or start making sense?  With so many positive reviews and awards I'm confused.  Perhaps I just didn't get what others got from it...  All I have to back me up is the crowd of friends with whom I went to see the film with.  And I'm the one who had the most positive words to say about it.","

It only took me two sittings to make it all the way - that's very good, at least for me!The best part of the film was the color, stunning in parts, beautiful and with great detail. It also had some wild characters and a bit of humor here and there, which helped. Overall, a good mix of good and evil and a different kind of story.Being it's Japanese, you are going to get some different theology than you are accustomed to in the West (""the spirits of the wind and water have healed you,"" etc.) but it's not presented in a heavy-handed manner.I was concerned early on as the young girl - the main character in the film - had a shrill voice that was not pleasant but she calmed down after the first part of the film. Overall, entertaining and worth several looks.","

"Lupercali","19 June 2004","About ten minutes into 'Spirited Away' you realise that this movie is going to be totally unlike anything you've ever seen before - even the director's previous movies. Half an hour into the the thing, you feel like you're witnessing some sort of collision between Walt Disney and David Lynch. Put simply, 'Spirited Away' is damn weird - sometimes charmingly weird, sometimes excitingly weird, but sometimes just plain old what the hell is a 'stink spirit', and why does it have a bicycle stuck in its side type weird.
If you think that is supposed to be criticism, think again. 'Spirited Away' is every bit as incredible as the most incredible things written about it would have you believe. It simply transports you to a meticulously realised universe of spirits and mythology; a world utterly brimming over with fantastical sights and characters. The realisation of this whole mise-en-scene is a monumental cinematic achievement. You come out of the movie really feeling like you've just spent two hours in some incredible parallel universe.The attention to detail is staggering, the surprises endless (and I just mean every damn camera shot has something in it that will make your jaw drop to one extent or another), and somehow through this barrage of unheralded ideas the central character comes through rock solid, as do all of the supporting ones.That isn't to say that characterisation is the movie's long suite. Perhaps it's just a cultural thing, but it seems to me that even the best Japanimation doesn't _quite_ have the Disney capacity to make you fall in love with the characters. Or perhaps you could argue that Disney is just overly sentimental. In any event this is really the only very slight fault I could find with 'Spirited Away' - and it is slight, because there are scenes, particularly in the latter part of the film, which will bring a lump to your throat.One quibble: people keep saying how much better the animation is in this film than in Disney (well, Disney aren't even doing hand-drawn animation anymore, but you know what I mean.) I think they mean that the backgrounds and drawings are better. The animation - literally the movement from frame to frame of the characters - is not up to top notch Disney standards. Watch a car drive along the road in the early part of the film: it is conspicuously jerky, unlike the smooth panoramic, sweeping animation of Disney in the past decade. However, except in those very early scenes, it isn't very noticeable, and even if you did notice it, you would be so gobsmacked by the amazing, almost poetic backdrops in so many of the scenes that you'd soon forget about it.I guess I've picked a few holes in 'Spirited Away', haven't I?  That's why I'm only giving it a meagre 9.5 out of 10.0.  It's a masterpiece. See it.","

"beresfordjd","2 January 2010","I find it hard to believe that anyone rates this film at all. Not one minute of this makes any sense. The animation is not as artistic as the fans of anime would have it. The story is ridiculous and the execution poor in the extreme. Anime is not my favourite form anyway but a good story is a good story especially if it is well executed. This garbage is neither a good story or well executed. It is as though some anime guy has just completed a bad LSD trip and committed it to film. There is no explanation of any happenings in the movie and all sorts of things happen surreal and otherwise and are just left to hang in the air. Pseuds would say that is the ""art"" in it. I say it's just daft and confusing for the viewer. There is little or no emotion in this endeavour either. Girl has parents turned to pigs-why? Maybe it makes more sense in the subtitled version than the dreadfully dubbed version but I doubt it very much. Another thing I hate about anime is the insistence in denying the ""Japanese-ness"" of the characters. They are drawn as westernised as any Pixar or Disney character. The only clue to its ethnic origin is the costume and backgrounds. All the kudos heaped on this tosh is a severe case of The Emperor's New Clothes. Avoid this rubbish , it is time you will never get back.","

I enjoyed it so much, I took some of my friends to see it a second time. This time I saw the English-dubbed version. I sat back and caught much more than the first time. I couldn't believe how much I missed without the dub. I could also get more emotionally involved and feel more connected to the film. The voice-acting was excellent.I just saw Princess Mononoke which got me thinking about Spirited Away. I was told that they were made by the same people. Although they are both good films, I would say Spirited Away is better over all.","

"masontullis","11 December 2021","First of all I am American and I haven't watched anime in the past. I wanted to see this movie because of its great reviews and resilience over the years. All together it was a very interesting film. I loved the score, the visual effects were stunning. There were scenes where I felt I was watching a Claude Monet painting. Stunning and very very creative. Even the characters developed beautifully. My biggest problem with the film was the randomness of the story. Granted I know nearly nothing about Japanese folk lore. The story was all over the place with random ""side missions"" that some how ended up helping the girl reach her goals. A lot of things that happened seemed to fall into place too perfectly. But we are talking about a film where a girl enters a magical spirit world so maybe it's not that hard to believe. Overall I think it deserves the recognition that it gets. It's fun to watch a movie that isn't made for my type of person that is still enjoyable to experience.","

"Nextwiggin","28 March 2006","I have some advice to anyone that hasn't seen this movie or did not like it but is attempting to watch it again: do not look at this movie the same way you look at western movies. This movie is meant to be a fable, and thus is chock full of metaphor. In fact, since it is set in the spirit world, EVERYthing is a metaphor. I don't want to impose my own views as to what those metaphors may mean, but it is important to accept, in a sense, that this movie doesn't have a plot. At least, not in the conventional sense. It would be better viewed as an exploration. Of what, I'll let you decide. Watch the movie, try to figure out what all the characters mean, why some are portrayed in a more favorable light and others not. It is also important to remember that, unlike western art in general, many of this movie's metaphors and messages have more than one meaning. I get the sense from reading the posts of other people, as well as some reviews, that many people have trouble realizing/accepting this. But, in my opinion, it is essential to move past this to truly enjoy and understand the movie and its message. The implication of this is also that it is impossible to fully understand the movie in just one viewing (or two, or many more). Like a painting, we are meant to look at this movie from different perspectives; close up and from far away and in different lights. All this is why I consider Spirited Away my favorite movie, and I hope that my advice will help some people see it in a different light. I don't claim to have all the necessary information to understand this movie, but rather I think I can help some people people who have trouble with this sort of movie and art enjoy it a bit more. So... have fun!","

"Danherb","2 June 2005","Seldom have I seen a movie full of such boundless fantasy, incredible beauty and opulent pictures. Miyazaki presents the story of Chihiro who has to rescue her parents from the spell of a witch in fantasy world with such extravagant richness that stuns the spectator.Granted the story about this fantasy world with all kinds of exceptionally weird creatures and situations takes needs getting used to at first. But very soon the spectator is totally engrossed by the magical story and overwhelming pictures.In view of the diversity of bizarre creatures, the filmmaker's creativity seems almost unlimited. The beautiful pictures have a very soothing and at the same time enthusiastic effect onto the spectator.But the brilliance of the movie doesn't only result from the beauty of the pictures, the story itself is very subtle and profound. In short, it is a story about growing-up. Chihiro and her parents are on their way to their new home in the suburbs when they accidentally step into a magical world, where Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs. From now on, Chihiro has to manage everything by herself. She has to attempt to turn her parents back into humans and is confronted with situations and characters that don't coincidentally seem like metaphors of our world. Now, Chihiro learns how to solve problems herself and how to deal with the characters of the people she meets. At the end, Chihiro has turned into a almost mature person. Although occidental spectator won't be able to understand all symbolisms that are conveyed by the characters, but there's is actually no need of it. The fantastic world and its creatures perfectly work as a scenery for a wonderful coming-of-age story. The wonderful, as customary for composer Joe Hisaishi, music adds even more magical beauty to the scenery.","

"Leofwine_draca","4 April 2013","SPIRITED AWAY is a well-regarded Studio Ghibli animation about a young girl's adventures in a fantastic netherworld filled with all manner of strange and terrifying creations. While it packs more imagination into one movie than ten Disney cartoons, it feels a little aimless and meandering, in search of a decent storyline to go along with the madcap creations.In terms of visual spectacle, at times this is as good as it gets for an anime: every scene features all kind of kooky, uniquely-crafted monsters and creatures. My favourite has to be the three bouncing heads. Unfortunately, the protagonist - a sullen little girl - turns out to be rather irritating and her journey to greater understanding is slow and over obvious.I'm inclined to like these Ghibli movies, but SPIRITED AWAY is no classic; it starts well and tails off, with a stodgy middle and better ending. So far, my favourites are those that take place in the 'real' world - like GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES and PONYO - rather than those that exist in a fantasy landscape, like this and the overrated PRINCESS MONONOKE.","

"Spleen","29 April 2003","I was surprised when ""Sprited Away"" turned out to be every bit as wonderful as everyone said it was  one of the world's rare ""worth queueing for"" films  because ""Princess Mononoke"" decidedly wasn't. Yet behold! And my partner, who's somewhat harsher than me in referring to Miyazaki's previous film as ""Princess Monotony"", was as enchanted as I was.I don't know how Miyazaki did it, exactly. He's created an altogether fresh fantasy world that doesn't come across merely as an all-too-laboured attempt to create an altogether fresh fantasy world. Describe it in words, and it sounds self-consciously quirky enough to put anyone off: it's a bath house for the spirits on the site of what appears to be a disused amusement park, presided over by an eccentric, mean-spirited old wizardess who's mother to a brat of an infant ten times larger than herself, the fires of which (the bath house, I mean) are stoked by a many-armed spider of a man who animates the soot particles to work for him ... and so on. It sounds like too much, too forced; but it unfolds on the screen naturally and magically, as though the world had simply been lying there, waiting to be discovered. And we discover it in exactly the right way (Miyazaki is a master story-teller, although I'd never thought so until now), through exactly the right protagonist: a girl who grows believably from a timid and clumsy outsider entirely reliant on the help and goodwill of others, to a confident (but still, no doubt, frightened) insider, able to help others in turn.Since this seems to be an issue, I should say that it was the dubbed version I saw. But I don't see why this should be an issue. I think that all the anime fans, in whose eyes Disney can do nothing right, who moan incessantly about how awful the dubbed version is, are having us all on. Don't get me wrong: I loathe dubbing. I think that, in general, subtitles are much to be preferred. But I also know that none of the arguments against dubbing, good though they are in general, happen to apply here. Dubbing is bad because it prevents the actors from really acting, from projecting their own words with their own bodies and vocal chords; but this can't happen in a cartoon in any case. Dubbing is bad because the match of mouth movements to words is never quite good enough; but this isn't live action, and it isn't even a Disney-style cartoon, with every sibilant, every quiver of the lip, lovingly captured by the animators in 24-drawings-per-second detail: Japanese animation is not and was never meant to be detailed in that kind of way, and I'll wager that the English soundtrack matches the lip movements about as well as the Japanese soundtrack ever did. Dubbing is sometimes bad because it's possible to dub something into a language that just doesn't fit, which MIGHT have happened here had it been an important part of the story that it take place in, say, Tokyo; but in fact it's set in an uncertainly located, almost surreal fantasy bath house; under the circumstances it doesn't matter in the least what language everyone is speaking. In short: just this once, you can go with the dubbed version (which, I might add, has been dubbed with both love and skill), and you needn't feel embarrassed about doing so.","

"benoitlelievre","10 May 2005","Remniscient of his fellow Japanese animator Satoshi Kon, Hayao Miyazaki offers us a good bath of Japanese folklore, suited in a well edited, fast paced, americanized form of animation. Miyazaki is more than a director, he's a writer. He's that kind of director that never leaves any kind of detail behind in quest to make a movie look over the top. This one was magnificent. Despite being billed as a child movie, well it ain't one, it's one of the most colorful audacious and creative anime ever made.The setting of the plot, from the start, makes room for creativity. Trapped in a spirit world, Chihiro has to grow as a person to fight the dangers on her way back to normality and back to her parents. In an avalanche of obstacles that rivals any literary epic, Chihiro grows a willpower that will go beyond of what she every imagined. Spirited Away is the epitome of true cinema. It exploits the possibilities and the variables that cinema has to offer. Every choice Miyazaki makes for his movie is the good one. Truly astonishing.So make the good choice too, buy this movie.","

I enjoy animation and watch plenty of subtitled film. The animation itself was superb, so crisp and bright, nostalgic in many ways. The score really complimented it also. I just did not really enjoy the story. It seemed to be very jumbled and trying to get too many themes and messages across. Greed, coming of age, friendship, even environmental harm. It was just too much. I found nearly all the characters somewhat annoying apart from Haku. The young girl who was the main hero grated on me after a while. The spirit world also was confusing. It was hard to figure out who was good and bad at times and I pondered whether all the spirits were actually being held prisoner. I also thought the ending was a bit lame. Without giving away too much they introduced a character towards the end and it somehow felt only to bring the movie to a conclusion and help the young girl. I would have liked to have seen a bit more of what happened after. A strange movie in many ways and I am baffled as to why I did not enjoy it and so many people rave about it and it lays claim to being one of the greatest movies of all time. Maybe I have missed something, I really don't know.","

Although the animation is crisp, clear, and flawless for what it does it breaks no new ground and doesn't deliver what I would consider an Oscar-worthy performance. The plot, if one can call it that, is thin; amounting to very little. This is Japanese `Alice in Wonderland' on hallucinogens.I'm completely at odds with all the rave reviews: this doesn't deserve any of it. I suggest everyone take a deep breath, and step back from being an otaku for just one second and rethink their viewpoints. For the uninitiated, this is pure fantasy gibberish. I have no choice but to give this movie sub-par ratings because of the plot-which is practically nil. I gave it the rating I did only because it is wonderfully colored and next to Akira is as flawless as anime will ever get; but at the same time its non-existent plot breaks the whole thing apart, and what you're left with is  well  nothing. It's all style and no substance.I give this a `4' only because it shows how good Japanese anime can look. Pity it was hobbled by not having a story worth sitting through.","

"Doylenf","2 July 2003","I watched the English language version of this nightmarish film and I can't understand the lavish praise bestowed on this Japanese animated fantasy. Its colors have a muted, washed-out look as it tells at great length the murky story of a little girl (with a screechingly high-pitched voice that gets on the nerves) who gets separated from her parents and enters the dark world of an abandoned amusement park. None of it makes any sense--at least not to American minds--so there must be something either lost in the translation or lost in the vast differences between American and Japanese culture. If this is a picture kids can relate to, I can only suppose that more kids than I thought are living in a nightmarish world ruled by adults.The story goes on for two hours without presenting anything except turning the girl's world into a nightmare of dead spirits and mean-spirited elders against which she is supposed to eventually be reunited with parents who have been turned into pigs. It's all so weirdly incomprehensible to adults and let me say firmly that there is no enchantment here. Perhaps you have to have the imagination of a ten-year old to see what's fun about this strange and fearsome world. Instead of entertaining us in the manner Lewis Carroll did with ALICE IN WONDERLAND and his cast of weird characters, it is much too dark and intense to be called anything but a Japanese nightmare of epic proportions with elements of other famous fairy-tales working their way through the tale.The dubbing for the English version should have used a different voice than the grating one used for the little girl. Definitely not a charmer.","

"soanim8ed","29 August 2002","Spirited Away is the latest in a string of incredible animated films by Hayao Miyazaki, the most renowned animator in Japanese history and most say in the best in world.  He takes a couple steps close to the best in the world title with this film. It's the story of Chihiro as she is caught in a world where humans are not allowed: a world of magic, gods and a Japanese bathhouse.  As we meet Chihiro we realize that she is a bit spoiled and has never done anything for herself.  As her adventures progress, she matures in ways that she doesn't even realize.  This is a journey of self-discovery and a study in forced independence.  Many have compared it to Alice In Wonderland, but where Alice, I thought, was a two-dimensional character going from adventure to adventure, Chihiro is well rounded.  She figures out how to be adaptable to an ever-changing world and discovers how to solve her problems instead of running away from them.  She is a `real' girl shoved into a world of Japanese mythology where she is ignorant of the rules.And her problem solving is the best part of the film and the reason I liked this one better then Princess Mononoke.  Chihiro uses her kindness, courage and courtesy as her weapons.  Even when violence erupts all around her, she relies on her wit and intelligence instead of magic, swords or arrows. These are lessons that children should be exposed to instead of explosions and gore that make up a lot of cinema. If I had kids, you bet I'd be taking them to see this one.But don't get me wrong; this film is able to thrill adults, too.  It is so full of imagination the film seems barely able to contain itself.  While it is not as lush as Mononoke (it may have been the print I saw), Spirited Away is gorgeously animated and the dubbing work is almost perfectly synched.  In fact, after Chihiro is whisked away I didn't even notice anything out of place.There were; however, about three scenes that I remember thinking that the score seemed out of place and became distracting, but that's my only complaint.  I can easily see why this is Japan's biggest moneymaking film of all time.  It's a story well told with visuals beautiful to behold.  It's simply timeless.","

"anselmdaniel","5 April 2022","This review contains spoilers.Spirited Away is an animated movie made by Studio Ghibli. The movie is about a young girl that finds herself transported to a magical land after her parents have been turned into pigs. The girl must learn about this new world to find a way to rescue her parents.Spirited Away's animation is the best aspect of this movie. The animation in this movie has a magical quality to it that aids in its magical theme and tone. This animation has a style that lends itself well to the strangeness on display. As a western audience member, the movie incorporated many aspects of Japanese myth and culture. Spirited Away had direction that utilized the confusion and curiosity of the main character. This movie continues this tone as the movie continues. As the main character learns more and stands for herself, the movie's tone changes as well.The English dub was excellent. This movie featured good performances all around with unexpected character performances. I cannot say for the Japanese voices, but the English voices capture the overall tone of the movie.The story of Spirited Away is easy to follow but there are deeper themes. Much like the animation, the story interweaves Japanese myths and culture. Some of this is lost on the Western audience however any audience member lucky enough to understand Japanese culture will have a complete experience. This is a movie that had a lot of elements in the background.I highly recommend ""Spirited Away"".Grade: A.","

"erikgloor","24 September 2002","Lyrically beautiful animation? Yes.Engrossing in parts? Yes.Representative of themes and mythologies hopelessly foreign to the Western audience? Possibly.Again, I just didn't get it. I didn't get it with 'Princess Mononoke' and I didn't get it with this picture either.Ever since I watched the anime epic ""Akira,"" some 12 years ago, I have been a fan of the genre. In fact, having spent much of my formative years in the living room of a childhood friend of Japanese descent watching tapes of shows (on Sony Betamax, of course) his relatives had sent form Japan, I have tracked the incredible heights the art form has achieved in the land of the rising sun. So for me, much of the animation in ""Spirited Away"" is old hat. Maybe I'm harder to impress than the average American. Maybe I have yet to locate an anime experience cooler than ""Akira."" Maybe I've decided that Disney does it better after all anyway. But the animation in this film, while impressive and filled with entertaining characters and visions, was not huge.Which leaves us with the plot. To which I can only say, ""Huh?"" I am gratified to have absorbed some of the analysis I've read on IMDb which helped me understand the meaning of at least one of the film's characters -- the strangely poetic ""No Face"" -- I fear the rest of the story failed to connect with me at all. Assuming the folks who translated the picture into English subtitles were able to accurately retain the meaning of the dialogue, and assuming that the film's themes were intended to be recognized not just by the average Japanese audience, we are left with a story that seemed, finally, rather pointless.***SPOILERS*** I mean, in the end, Chihiro, through integrity and determination, is able to thank the river god, Haku, who kept her from drowning as a smaller child? Excuse my French, but BFD! ***END SPOILERS***I just didn't care. And all the disembodied heads and soot creatures and giant babies and large-headed witches and talking toads and flying dragons couldn't make me care. Not by a long-shot.So, we're left with a longish, visually engaging movie that you probably won't care about.You could do worse, I suppose.This movie review by Erik Gloor","

"andrewroy-04316","18 March 2019","Spirited Away is both a beautiful to watch animated movie and gives the viewer plenty of ideas and symbols to ponder, but the story itself and particularly its conclusions left me ready to move on. I have the utmost respect for animation studios and Studio Ghibli after watching Spirited Away. Miyazaki puts in so many small visual details that immerse you in the spirit world and make it so much more realistic. In terms of the story itself, I found it inconsistent. There are plenty of great themes and ideas to consider, the two that stood out most to me being greed vs kindness in the characters, and the older, more naturalistic mindset clashing with the materialistic, capitalistic modern mindset. Chihiro is a fun protagonist who avoids one-dimensionality, having both a multifaceted personality and an arc that significantly shows her character develop throughout.
Where the story broke down for me was in several of the plot events and details of the world. Simply put, I found the ending to be deus ex machina and an overly simplistic and easy way to solve what had seemed like big, complex challenges. I didn't buy her sudden love with Haku and the way their relationship transitioned from a caring friendship to quite committed love. I also didn't find the addition of Yubaba's twin to make any sense, she felt like a superfluous character added in as a weird twist. The way she got her parents back felt completely absurd and was when I accepted that it just isn't a great movie. In addition to these and other plot frustrations, maybe it was an intentional choice to make the spirit world feel whimsical and ambiguous, but the lack of clarity in how the world functions limited my enjoyment. Are all of them spirits? How many of them are being held there against their will (like Haku)? What is the true motivation of all the spirits? How do the spirits interact with the physical world, and how do their transformations and magical powers work? I found many underlying workings of the spirit world to be unclear in addition to plot points that were either contrived or superfluous. I definitely enjoyed watching it and I do like the consistent, immersive feel of the movie from a young girl discovering this wild world perspective, but the exposition and later plot events didn't completely satisfy me.","

This is one of those horrible Manga type movies that that depicts people with massive eyes and a tiny nose and they looks terrible. The backing animation is good , as is the soundtrack , but the story is mind bendingly bad. The whole movie is like one big acid trip and i really would be weary about showing this to a young child. It's over two hours long and extremely hard to get through. All i can think is that everyone in Japan voted for this film because i really cannot see any appeal in this film and it's a travesty it's anywhere near this list.","

"TheBigSick","14 September 2017","First of all, this film is not for all ages. With so many frightening horror images and disgusting monster characters, it should be rated NC-17.Secondly, the plot lacks credibility. Haku, No-Face and Zeniba, especially Haku, are nice and helpful to Sen just for no reasons. Thirdly, there is no clear objective or aim throughout the film. Sen does not know how to return to the human world with her parents. It is not until the very end that Haku comes up with a solution. All in all, this is probably the most overrated film of all time, and Hayao Miyazaki is arguably the most undeserving director ever.","

"x_manicure_x","14 August 2021","Above all Studio Ghibli films, ""Spirited Away"" is probably the most widely recognized across the world thanks to its exotic, hauntingly beautiful art direction. The Japanese tradition-infused world of spirits that he managed to create here has such a unique atmosphere and some of the most memorable creatures to ever appear in an animation film.Stunning visuals aside, the same issues that tend to affect most Studio Ghibli films are still there to some extent. Hayao Miyazaki is a master at creating worlds, populating them with captivating characters, and setting a magical atmosphere, but the storytelling always feels kind of lackluster and unfulfilling. ""Spirited Away"" actually begins on the right foot and holds pretty well until Chihiro leaves the bathhouse to return the seal to Zeniba. That's when things were supposed to get even more interesting, but basically nothing happens. The ending and final resolution also felt rushed and low-key. Overall it's still a good fairytale for both children and grownups, but I am not sure we are talking about the best animation film of all times as everyone keeps saying.","

"SnoopyStyle","18 September 2016","Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino is a spoiled unhappy girl moving with her parents to the countryside. Her father takes a wrong turn and ends up in front of the entrance to an abandoned theme park. They walk through a tunnel, across a dry artificial stream, and find one operating food booth. Her parents can't find anybody but starts eating anyways. She refuses and walks off when she meets a boy called Haku. He implores her to leave across the water before nightfall. She's too late and the dry riverbed becomes a vast river. The park becomes inhabited by spirits. Haku sends her to boiler-man Kamaji and tells her to beg for a job with the ruthless witch Yubaba who runs the magical bathhouse.This is possibly the first Hayao Miyazaki I saw and in my opinion still his best. He's done plenty of great work but this is the pinnacle. It's a simple coming-of-age story but filled with magic and wonder. It added to the language of animated cinema.","

"elsinefilo","4 March 2006","I should start this comment by saying: You need some time to ponder over that anime! First of all I am not Japanase so it's not easy to affiliate yourself with Japanese culture(for example if you know nothing about Shinto religion it's really difficult to put pieces together)When I first finished watching that movie I thought ""Hey it's really fun but it's just a conglomeration of imaginary fantasies but when I really pondered upon it and when I did some reading on it I realized that there are more to Spirited Away that eyes can see at surface. For example there is no clear-cut distinction between good and evil just like in real life right. Even Haku and No-Face who seem good at first look have their share of bad and good within their souls. Words have such a power in the movie. For instance Chihiro has to keep her real name in her mind if she doesn't want to be entrapped in the spirit world. This is actually what we do in real life. We attach such an importance to words that our emotions like anger,love,hatred,passion are channeled through the power of words. Greed makes spirits and people oblivious to what really matters in the movie. Spirits and people's greed (even Chihiro is greedy when it comes to grasping her parents attention)is self-destructive mostly. In short Spirited Away shows us the consequences of actions that alter the natural order of things in destructive ways just look around you you'll see how we humans are self-destructive by creating a figment of our imagination that we are not hurting ourselves but others to gain a place.Spirited is the story of transformation of a whining weak greedy little girl into a capable altruist brave girl.I say don't miss it!","

"Camoo","9 April 2007","I would give everything in my life to sustain the feeling I get from watching the minute and a half sequence of Chihiro taking the ghost train submerged in water... You know what I'm talking about. This moment is one of the most special I've ever seen, it evokes a mystical feeling deep inside myself, and it's a feeling that I might live for. It's a carefully orchestrated affair, this moment could only work after experiencing the hour that came before, in the key that came before, everything about this minute, from the music, the subtle taint of computer animation, to the magical imagery might be what Werner Herzog means when he talks about 'an ecstatic truth'. Not many films achieve this moment, and it is incredibly hard to define, but it strikes deep in a person's core, in his soul...","

"Horst_In_Translation","18 December 2015","""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" or ""Spirited Away"" is probably the most famous work (especially abroad) by Japanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki, also because he won an Academy Award for it and non-English-language films winning in the Best Animated Feature category is certainly not the rule, which makes it an even more exceptional achievement. The film is already almost 15 years old and runs for roughly 2 hours. A little girl enters a fantastic world with her parents, but their greed makes them transform into pigs right away, the parents only, not the girl. And after that, she gets deeper and deeper into that fantastic world, makes friends and foes, both of which are the most fascinating creatures, including witches, dragons and many other mythical figures.One of the aspects I liked most about this film was that basically no character was either completely black or white. Even the evil witch loves the big baby and has to follow certain rules in her last scene for example. She has a good twin sister by the way, also an interesting inclusion. The animation is really good and memorable here and I personally believe this film is a great choice if you want to take a deeper look into Studio Ghibli movies, something that is considered the best animation film production studio these days together with the big famous American Pixar company. You can certainly see a lot of heart in their works and, hands down, it does not get much more creative than ""Spirited Away"".All in all, this film never dragged and that is always a decent achievement for films that cross the 2-hour mark. It has some nice lessons on friendship, motherhood, dedication and many other important subjects, which is probably the main reason this film is loved so much and so high in the IMDb top250. There is a lot lot more than wonderful animation here. I cannot really comment on the voice acting as I, of course, watched this one with subtitles as I don't understand a word Japanese, but I think they are probably doing a solid job as they are all fairly experienced and I never heard that this could be the film's one weakness. I cannot come up with a weakness while watching this. The drama was never over-the-top or unrealistic and even if it was, it could have been somewhat justified with all the fantastic stuff going on. Excellent watch and one of the best animated films of the 2000s. Highly recommended.","

"nickname1","29 September 2003","'Spirited Away' is a Japanese film, and is available in the UK in dubbed & subtitled versions. I saw the subtitled film and (with the exception of occasional gaps & pauses in the subtitling) I judge it to be the best animation since Akira, or possibly even Pinnoccio. The storyline is (in outline) no more incredible than most anime, but the film excels because it is bursting with unusual ideas. The imaginative imagery is wedded with fine, detailed animation and evocative music. Some parts of the film (chases/drives through foliage/flowers/within the bath-house) are exceptionally detailed and visually striking. There are (thankfully few) portions of the film soundtrack that suffer an outbreak of a Richard Clayderman-esque piano composition (IMO), but generally the sound supports the animation well and the animation was continually stimulating and moving. I give this (original film with subtitles)  9 OUT OF 10.","

"jboothmillard","10 January 2006","I had only experienced Japanese cartoons with the mildly entertaining but ultimately terrible Pokémon and Digimon, but I have to say, I was looking forward more to this good looking film from Studio Ghibli, dubbed into English, from director Hayao Miyazaki (Princess Mononoke). Basically ten-year old Chihiro (Lilo & Stitch's Daveigh Chase) is moving to a house in the suburbs with her mother (Dumb and Dumber's Lauren Holly) and father (The Shield's Michael Chiklis). They get out of the car to walk down a lonely dirt road, and end up in open country surroundings, and finding a café which the parents eat in. Chihiro wanders off, and briefly meets the mysterious Haku (Jason Marsden) who warns her to leave immediately, but she can't when she discovers her parents have become pigs, literally. Haku finds her and promises to help by by getting a job at the bathhouse working for Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette), who has a nicer twin sister Zeniba (also Pleshette) and the thousands of God and spirit customers. Chihiro does as well as she can in this strange world, but she must find a way to break her parents spell and be able to return home. Also starring Hercules' Susan Egan as Lin, David Ogden Stiers as Kamajii and John Ratzenberger as Assistant Manager. The story is a little strange, but bare in mind it is Japanese, but with good dubbing voices and aspiring animation, you'll enjoy the experience. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and it won the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language. It was number 68 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!","

"Sinnerman","21 March 2002","I enjoyed this movie very much. I can still recall when I was watching it the first time round, I could not take my eyes off the spell binding visuals and ended up missing some of the subtitles. Its that good! In Spirited Away, a little girl was marooned in a spiritual world and subsequently enslaved by an 'Enterprising' Witch to work in a bath house for gods and demons. Literally signing her name away in this strange new world, we join the little girl in her fascinating journey to regain her freedom(name) and save her parents( who were unceremoniously turned into pigs by the evil witch prior) along the way. Spirited Away's awesome sights and sound elevates it into a classic amongst animated films. The film can be enjoyed solely on the level of a family entertainment/ kid flick. Which is why I admired the director(Japanese Master animator Hayao Miyazaki) even more as he has also  crafted a fabled story with shaded hues, where nothing presented is clearcut black or white. I particularly liked the way they treat gods and spirits in a manner befitting its heritage. Infact, this unpretentious film can also be viewed as an allegorical meditation on innocence, Asian values, spirituality and existentialism - deep issues worth pondering for folks out there. Anyone from 6yrs to 106yrs old will enjoy Spirited Away as it brings out a child like wonder within you, while simultaneously offering a wealth of wisdom and insights. However cynical you are of 'cartoons',  you will be charmed. This should be one reason why this CARTOON has become the All time Biggest Box Office Hit in Japanese History, grossing more than US$200million in Japan alone!!","

"tj_director","14 August 2003","I either post a review when i loathe a film, or feel a film has been unfairly dissed.. but in this case it's because i completely adored it.
I think Miyazaki is a genius, i really do, people compare the story to Wizard Of Oz or Alice In Wonderland, and they are very similar in content, a fantastic new world, and a young girl who must learn more about herself and others to leave, and just like those 2 stories this one if FULL of imagination, every single minute is filled with something new and fresh, borrowing from Japanese mythology as well as Miyazaki's previous creations (i.e. the adorable soot creatures), it ranges from the surreal to the sublime. The story can be written on a post it note, yet my biggest flaw with the film is that is a good half hour too short! i simply didn't want the film to stop.. but i suppose that was the whole point of being spirited away... I think there are people who might find things a bit too wierd and tripped out, but they can't deny the overall message of the film, it isn't some huge life changing event that the hype makes it feel to be, it is just one of the most amazing films ever made, there is a beautiful subtlely to it all.. it doesn't have some mad epic grandouise adventure plot, there are no mega set pieces, no songs or big numbers, the film is mostly set in one building, there are times when you don't know where the story is going, or if there is any.. but this is a common feeling in Miyazaki films, they aren't about getting those pre-set highs or step by step film structure.. they are more about escaping to another world and being a part of it.. which is in my mind the greatest single thing a film or book can do... and this film achieves it, by the end you will be moved, maybe not to streaming tears, but you will feel something.. this film will mean something to everyone! a genuine masterpiece :)","

"Teknofobe70","7 June 2003","Looking at this film as an outsider, someone who knows very little about Miyazaki's films or ANY anime film for that matter, I've got to say that I found it to be a real breath of fresh air, and a welcome break from Disney films. It encourages me to go out and seek more anime films, but I also fear that I might be disappointed by those films if they aren't as great as this one.Most of the film is set in a hotel for spirits which is ruled over by an evil witch and is staffed by a variety of extremely weird, but certainly original, monsters. A young girl named Chihiro (or Sen) finds herself trapped here after her parents trespass on the property, and must work there until she can find a way to escape with them. With it's cultural sensibilities, the film at times has a harsher edge than you would expect to find in your average American cartoon, but in the end it is also extremely heart-warming.As I'm not really familiar with Anime, the closest Western parallel I can think of would be pixar's Monsters Inc., which was similarly interesting and original. Whether or not children will understand or enjoy this film I don't know, but adults will certainly find it interesting. It's worth noting that though I've only seen the subtitled version, there is an English dubbed version also available if you do want to show it to your kids.","

It probably makes better cultural sense in Japan, without dubbing, but the basic concepts of loyalty, truth, bravery, and sacrifice transcend cultural differences.The main character, Sen, is totally believable as a young girl in a bizarre setting, who learns to adapt to new people, new customs, and new emergencies.  When Sen sets her jaw and follows through on a plan, I felt like saying, ""Yes!  Go for it, Sen.""Warning:  I would hesitate to take young children to this film.

"jazzest","27 August 2004","(A Little Spoilers Included)As Hayao Miyazaki's fame grows internationally, his Japanimation productions become more sophisticated, more aware of the Western audience (In Spirited Away, the viewers can see the Western influence on some characters' facial features, most namely, Yubaba's), and, at the same time, less spirited than his earlier works. While Spirited Away may be one of the most well-designed productions of his, the story is relatively simple and focuses on a single argument, greed, which occasionally gets too ugly. Some settings are weak or absurd without reasonable explanations (e.g., why does Yubaba have to offer a job to anyone who's willing to work? What's the point that Haku, the lover of Sen/Chihiro, used to be a river in ""our"" world?). Composer Jo Hisaishi appropriately enhances the neutral nature of the film with a John-Adams-ish indistinguishable post-minimalism score.","

It really is quite spectacular and even terrifying at times.Although Chihiro is not a great character, instantly going from brat to scared little girl never to return in a matter of seconds, you really have a powerful sense of being trapped in a strange and exotic land that only grudgingly has a place for you.The plot is fairly engaging as we try to get home and struggle with a few episodes at the bathhouse.Worth a couple of viewings as we explore some interesting ideas on the nature of identity and culture being lost in industrial modernity, we get an ethnically rich and frequently grotesque hybrid of cultural flavour and the monstrosity of big business with only a modicum of the sanctimoniousness that is Hayao's signature.Sweet, funny and again with a score that will be your new guilty pleasure, this may not be Ghibli's (or even Hayao's) best movie, but it's place in those top 100 lists is more of less earned even if as usual it is as a feat of spectacle and imagination, not so much of story telling.On that note we are one climax away from a great movie. The thing just...stops. But it's the journey not the destination. I feel this could have made a very dignified movie for all ages but seems to have been intentionally ""kidified"". Something Frozen thankfully didn't do.Great feature for a new year's eve in with an oriental buffet on your lap and good company.Both English and original versions are equally good.","

"howard.schumann","3 November 2003","Animism is a belief that a soul or spirit exists in every object. Shinto, the native religion in Japan that goes back to 500 BC, has incorporated many of the ideas of animism, worshipping the spirits of mountains, rivers, rocks and trees and using rituals that connect people to nature's timeless flow. Many of the spirits and stories from the Shinto religion are depicted in Miyazaki's animè feature Spirited Away and the director has said that many images in the film came from his childhood memories of traditional Japanese culture. Spirited Away won the 2003 Oscar for Best Animated film and has been deservedly praised for its imaginative story, brilliant colors, and superior technical achievements.As an unhappy ten-year old girl, Chihiro, travels with her parents to her new home in the countryside, they take a wrong turn and end up in what they think as an abandoned theme park. Separated from her parents, who partake in a gluttonous meal, the little girl is drawn to a bathhouse for spirits and enters an alternate reality. Her parents have been transformed into pigs and she is trapped in a world she can barely understand. Chihiro does not change or grow up suddenly but calls upon her inner strength that she barely knew existed to help her out in dangerous situations. She is helped by young Haku, an assistant to Yubaba, the bathhouse manager who tells her that her only chance is to ask Kamajii for work in the boiler room (Miyazaki said that he was trying to show Japanese girls who never had to work the experience of hardship). Kamajii in turn sends her to Yubaba (yet another wicked witch stereotype) who steals her name, calling her ""Sen"" and gives her difficult tasks that she must undertake successfully in order to free her parents and return home.Along the way, Chihiro encounters physical and psychological dangers. There are no simple villains in the film but there are many repulsive creatures such as a boiler room boss with six tentacles, a giant grotesque baby, rolling heads, stink monsters, and the like. One wonders where these images come from since Japanese gods have no actual form and elementals in mythology are part of the simple beauty and magic of nature. Yet, unlike the Disneyfied view of the world with sharp lines separating good and evil, Miyazaki's film is ambiguous and shifting and Chihiro must adapt, figure out the world she is in, and learn whom to trust. When Chihiro begins to control her own destiny, she creates supportive friends to help her complete her tasks and, in the process, discovers abundant courage and a sense of responsibility. As she and Haku move toward freedom, they both realize that they cannot escape their enslavement until they remember who they really are, a metaphor for all of us groping toward our spiritual connection. The power they find does not consist of magic spells or objects to render opponents senseless but the energy that flows from love, forgiveness, and non-violence. Spirited Away is a remarkable achievement and a film that left me feeling uplifted and connected to a greater reality.","

"LaurieMann","2 November 2002","Ya gotta wonder - Disney is the US distributor, Disney knows how to market animated features - why has this breathtaking animated feature not been promoted at all in this country?It's a great movie, but really not for small children and it really doesn't have the toy/gadget possibilities of Disney flicks as most of the characters are not at all cute (except for Chihiro, of course).  And, perhaps, since animated features are now eligible for an Oscar, perhaps Disney decided to dump this movie, keep it forgotten in America, so they can promote the amusing (but hardly great) Lilo and Stitch come Oscar time.This movie has some of the most breathtaking backgrounds and animation I've ever seen.  True, here and there it has the kind of stilted animation of '60s TV animation.  But once Chihiro starts her adventures in the bathhouse, the animation practically leaps off the screen.  The level of detail in the backgrounds, particularly in the ""witch's lair"" is unlike anything I've ever seen (even better than Beauty and the Beast, which set the bar pretty high for outstanding detail).I don't know much about Japanese myth/legend, and I suspect that the Japanese moviegoers got much more out of this movie than I did.   Still, it was great fun to watch.  Chihiro is a genuinely annoying kid early in the film, and showed more character development during the course of the movie than some live actors I could mention.  Early in the movie, her parents are enchanted by a witch, and the rest of the movie is about little Chihiro almost going through hell to bring them back.This is probably not a good movie for sensitive children, but most kids much above six or seven should have a ball with it.","

"rosscinema","7 December 2003","This is considered one of the best (If not the best) Anime' films ever made and its cinematic storytelling at its finest. Not since ""Akira"" has an animated film made the impact like this. This was created by the Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki who is considered a god in terms of Anime' and its his wonderful stories and imagination that makes him so special. This is the story of a ten year old girl named Chihiro who is traveling with her parents to their new home and she is sad that they have to move. Her father takes what seems like a wrong turn and they come across a structure with a tunnel in the middle. They all get out and walk through to the other side and Chihiro's father recognizes it as an old park that has gone under over the years. They come across another structure with food set out and Chihiro's parents waste no time in helping themselves to as much food as they can eat. Chihiro discovers to her horror that her mother and father have turned into pigs and she runs off to try and find help. She encounters a boy named Haku that takes her into the strange world where spirits and witches habitat and he tells her to find someone named Kamaji and ask for a job. She is looked down on as a human but she manages to find Kamaji who has eight legs like a spider and he gets her a job. Chihiro works with Lin who is an older female and she shows her what to do and where to sleep. Chihiro helps out cleaning and delivering but at night she sneaks out to talk with Haku who is helping her get her parents back and to be able to go home.Miyazaki has such a broad sense of imagination and this is reflected in his other films like ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and this film is probably even greater than those two. This film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and it certainly deserved it. One of the joys of watching Miyazaki's films is that you have no idea what so ever has to what will happen next. The characters and events take the viewer on a strange and fantastic voyage that has never been seen before. Yubaba the witch has a giant baby named Boh, Haku turns into a flying dragon and Kamaji has these dustball/spider things carry lumps of coal to a furnace that heats everything. One of the big highlights of this film is the ""Stink Spirit"" that is this giant glob of river mud and Chihiro helps it get clean. While she does this she helps pull out all the junk (Bicycles, assorted metal, etc..) until we see what this spirit really looks like. This is the type of animated feature that children should view and this is not to knock American animated films but the Japanese concern themselves more with the stories. Children should view films that will enhance they're imagination but unfortunately most of the crap they are forced to watch is usually something that they can guess as to what will happen next. Miyazaki had no plans to make another film but happily he is working on another one! This is a great animated film and it should be recommended viewing for children although adults will love this also.","

"meetjopeblack","1 February 2005","highly philosophical and deeply profound. I've seen this film for more than 5 times now and each viewing is still a new experience. It makes one reflect on family relations, growing up, embodiment, and one's name (so philosophical that it borders on not being able to be understood by the audience). If you're not in it for the insight, fill yourself with the beautiful graphics and display of colors. Spirited Away is a visual delight transporting you to a totally different world of spirits, spells, and magic. It is so realistic that one may get that spooky feeling after watching the movie (I did feel this because of No-name). The art complements the story; the animation gives life to the plot.Spirited Away is a wonder--the best of the best Miyazake animation films. With so many subplots, the film is able to sew together every bit of information and symbol it has solid tight. Every question answered, every character full of meaning. Sometimes, animation is better than real life. Spirited Away sure is a winner.","

"thewubbelupagus","22 March 2006","I never thought I liked anime until recently. Prior to this, the only titles I had enjoyed were the Animatrix, and Ghost in the Shell. They play a lot of anime shows on cartoon network, and I've tried to get into them, but usually watch a minute or so, find them irritating, and easily turn to something else.I tuned into a showing of this film however, and was instantly captivated. Its so very unique and wonderful I simply could not turn it off. I couldn't even partake of my usual channel surfing for fear of missing a minute of its goodness when it came back from commercial! Although I think it loses some of its magic when Chihiro/Sen starts to get used to her new surroundings, it stays genuinely entertaining to the end. I would recommend this film to anyone as a good jumping off point for exploring Anime.","

"Naughtia_Nah","15 November 2011","I'm usually not that into anime/manga styled cartoons but this one blew me away. I found this title on IMDb's top 250 list, so I had to see what all the fuss was about.This movie is about a little girl Chihiro who wanders in to a mysterious world of wonders. Humans aren't welcome in this world, when discovered they get transformed into animals. Chihiro's parents have been transformed into sloppy pigs, and Chihiro is now on a mission to get her parents back and return to her home.This movie takes you on a wild ride through the depths of imagination. The thing that impressed me the most were the visual effects, the characters and wild imagination of the designers/animators. The characters are all lovable in each way and the mystery is remarkable. I did not expect to get such a good experience and I do not at all regret watching the movie. This is an must see classic.","

"Sinnerman","28 October 2002","I don't get it. Someone should forward the many positive IMDB user comments here to Disney. I can't help but feel there has been a blatantly mishandled distribution strategy for this film in the US of A.Despite its near 100% critical praises and its massive US$200 million box office take even before its American release, Spirited Away is still playing in less than 100 theatres nation wide, which caused it to undeservedly languish in the lower reaches of the American movie charts even as we speak.There has been much speculative criticism over Disney conspiratorial mishandling of Mayazaki's last film, the classic Princess Mononoke. It has since been disproved as an urban legend and the benefit of the doubt was given to Disney. How could it be possible that a company like Disney would willingly sacrifice profits for a greater aim of secretly smothering Mayazaki films for fear of adversely affecting its own vault of animated films?Sadly, the present state for ""Spirited Away"" will definitely be re-surrecting this previously dispelled conspiracy theory. Unless the marketing/ distribution strategy for Spirited Away is revamped completely (i.e. a massive `Toy Story like' promotional campaign followed by a well deserved wide release relaunch), this lingering tainted image for the mouse company and Hollywood at large will likely remain. You heard it here first. Expose Hollywood for what it is, a sinister oligopolistic business enterprise with hidden agendas of buying up distribution and remake rights of worthy Asian films, so as to smother them and minimise their chances of American success, thereby safeguarding their own selfish financial and market interest.Its so disgustingly evil it makes me sick.","

"asandor","14 July 2015","Spirited Away is a film directed by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, and animated by Studio Ghibli. It is also one of my favourite films. The animations are absolutely breath-taking, which is a staple from many Ghibli films. However, Spirited Away does something special, creating a world that will consistently amaze with its attention to detail, and the magical fantasy it brings to the table.The film is about a young girl, Chihiro, who is trapped in the spirit world, and has to save her parents from a calculating witch, Yubaba. She is helped by a colourful cast of characters who are all charming, but all morally ambiguous as well. This film is detailed to the extreme in the story and character department as well!As mentioned, this is one of my favourite films. It is an absolute work of art, and should be recognized as a classic. I would highly recommend this film to anyone, adult and (maybe more mature) children alike. This film does contain scenes that may frighten young children, but the fantasy elements capture even my imagination. This film will definitely expand your horizons.This is a flawless film for families. It is absolutely recommended. 10/10","

"Rectangular_businessman","17 June 2010","Spirited Away is a totally unique celebration of friendship, love, and learning responsibility. Beautiful animation and a superb score supplement a fantastic story. A young girl gets trapped in a world of spirits and she has adventures. It's a bit like a Japanese Alice In Wonderland. What cannot be explained so easily is the depth of feeling to this film. The world of the film contains so many eccentricities small and large. Motifs are carried through here and there, woven throughout. Characters come and go and switch and change. The atmosphere shifts and the feelings created ebb and flow. How can it make me feel so exuberant and sad? Why am I so nostalgic for something I cannot name? This movie is the rush of life as an adventurethe people you touch becoming friends and then leaving suddenly. It is the forgotten moments of childhood shimmering through the haze of adulthood. It is the journey of maturing that we all must take. We are the masters and authors of our own life, but damn, it is the people in it that make it worth mastering. I am always thrilled to remember that a Japanese ""children's"" film illustrates this so subtly and elegantly.","

"JG2001","17 September 2002","After Miyazaki created the more maturely minded Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away is an excellent return to some of his earlier themes, such as childhood innocence and how love and friendship can save the day, all without the typical shmaltz that infects Hollywood childrens' films. The film is a blast for older audiences, whether they watch the film with children or others their own age.Die hard Miyazaki fans will recognize the soot balls from the director's 1988 film My Neighbor Totoro, which also strongly focused on childhood. Though, where Totoro was a lighthearted romp, Spirited Away is definitely darker, much in the sense of Alice in Wonderland, though it has nothing to do with Lewis Carrol's work. The atmosphere is entirely Miyazaki's own, and after watching it, it's easy to see how the film set a box office record, becoming the highest grossing domestic film in Japanese history, right ahead of Princess Mononoke.","

"arkif1","10 February 2007","Hayao Miyazaki has an ambition that is seldom met these days in popular art. He uses every element of his films to bear a meaning that is part of the film's vision of society.Spirited Away is about the working world. The English translation does castrate him here and there - in the original there's no talk of ""a deal"" between Haku and Yubaba, which, in effect, changes Yubaba's character from benevolent to malicious and also removes an important lesson that Chihiro has learned - but the entangledness of relations, the almost mystical whole, a world whose true meaning lies in the places that its inhabitants owe it, overwhelms the viewer even so.A world that might be endangered by those, who subscribe to ideas forgetting about themselves. This single thing, used in the film in a twofold way, as both the beginning and the end of this world, on one end Yubaba and her lock on names and individuality and on the other No-Face and his seduction by something that looks more valuable than it really is, is already reason enough to consider Hayao Miyazaki a t r u e artist.It makes no sense to rate other great films worse only because there is one Hayao Miyazaki, so I'm not doing that. But what I do, and I can only encourage anybody to do alike, is to look at his films with the same respect that I look at a Picasso or listen to a Wagner opera.","

"heisenberg12","1 February 2019","I have no idea how this is ranked 27 on Top IMDB Movies. I only watched it to try to discover why it was ranked so high. If you are not an animation-film fan, then it will have no value to watch. That being said, I really wanted to like it. It starts good in the first 5 minutes, but quickly becomes a disjointed fantasy world that doesn't really make much sense. Maybe this is just a movie made for children, but it's surprising it is ranked so high with so many adults rating the film.I would suppose from a technical animation standpoint, the art and visuals are great (I wouldn't know. In a way it didn't seem any better than Scooby Doo or the Flinstones I watched as a kid). The score is actually excellent, and that's the only reason I give it a generous 3. Oh, and the ending is decent, too- at least we finally discover what that overlong, boring, and disjointed adventure was all about. Even on its anime merits, this shouldn't be in the top 250, yet alone top 30 unless it was strictly an animation film or tv show list.2/10","

"movieguy1021","20 October 2002","Alice in Wonderland, eat your heart out, there's a new fantasy that surpasses you. Spirited Away is one great film with superb animation and characters you actually care about.Chihiro is voiced by Daveigh Chase, aka Lilo from Lilo and Stitch. She and her family are moving and are almost at their new house when a wrong turn leads them into a tunnel. It begins like a Scooby-Doo episode. Mysterious characters running around an abandoned theme park. But the rest of the movie unfolds like no other. A feast is layed out, and Chihiro's parents start pigging out and-of course-turn into pigs. Soon other characters come out and Chihiro flees for her life. Various, and odd, events ensue.I have got to say-if there was ever a movie for everyone in the family to enjoy, this is the one! Interesting characters, interesting events, and interesting visuals encourage a very interesting moviegoing experience. We have got to hand it to Miyazaki (the director), he's created another world that will stick with us for the rest of our sane lives.I'm not into animè at all, but the animation was-wow! It looked like two different settings-the very realistic background and the obvious characters. The emotions on the humans were very real (or as real as this movie could be). All of the various ""others"" from the opposite world were life-like and seemed real. However, there was one thing that I didn't fully understand-what was the purpose of No-Face? He could have been just in there for linking purposes, but it doesn't really bother me one iota.A lot of times, my heart was a'going th-thump. There were many tense moments, many funny moments, and many, many powerful, dramatic moments. You smile when Chihiro is happy; you're sad when she is sad. There are some movies that can make you do that, but not many. A very creepy moviegoing experience.The 124 minute runtime seemed to run by quick. It felt like awhile for the movie, but you hardly noticed it. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. When I walked out, I heard some other kid say, ""It was OK, I guess."" Spirited Away is not really a little kid's movie. They'll be too scared and will not be able to fully grasp the potential of the film. They also seemed upset because it was ""so long"". Don't go to many more movies, kiddos. This'll seem like a commercial.Miyazaki, if I could, I would shake your hand. You've created a masterpiece, plain and simple.My rating: 10/10Rated PG for scary moments and a surprising amount of blood.","

I do recommend this, to all ages, it gives you quite the perspective of adventure and a new sense in realizing the differences in everything. The movie was really thrilling it was a bridge from our world to another. it absolutely was, i want to get it on DVD. Anyone, anyone at all would love it, at times it seems like a little kiddie then other times it appears more mature and more advanced but its in the middle its really good for all ages. I guess you just need to understand it. Wonderful characters (well, some of them), effects were good, designs were something i haven't seen before, it was all pleasant.All i can really say to explain it is that its; A bridge from our world to another.","

"smakawhat","20 September 2002","I ran and took the metro for about 45 minutes way across state lines. Living in Northern Virginia, this show was playing in only 2 theatres in the DC metro area (composed of DC, VA and MD). I had to head to the Mezza Galeria in Friendship Heights way out on the edge of NorthWest DC on the border with Maryland. Basically it is a trip that I will never forget and I will now always associate that area with the greatness of witnessing this masterpiece.. This film has already grossed over 200 million dollars and won major awards at film festivals, all without even being released in North America. Until now....Basically put here it is (not giving any info away that would be VERY wrong). Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (Spirited Away), is a trip about a 10 year old girl who enters a magical spirit land with her parents who end up imprisoned. It is up to 10 year old Chihiro to find the strength inside to survive and perhaps rescue her parents.But this film isn't about that plot, it is about the imagination of youth, the magic and characters who exist in this world, and about growing up and gaining courage.I'll say this. I am having a really REALLY hard time putting the emotions I felt after witnessing this masterpiece on the screen. The scenes are masterfull, the animation is incredible, the backgrounds are pieces of art, there are things that happen in great stillness, and in great motion that take your breath away. It is very funny, and charming. However what separates this film from say Miyazaki's last recent work Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) is that this film is more universal for all ages and more imaginative, incredibly so on the later. Where Mononoke was more political and intriguing and ingenious this film is something every person can relate to including 7 year olds. As one earlier minor review I read said, ""Kids will like it, parents will love it even more"". I can't begin to describe my jaw gaping mouth that stood there hanging almost every 5 minutes at what I was witnessing.. I could spend hours describing the myriad of characters in detail, but I would be writing to the end of time....There is a scene in this film that just highlights everything that is grand about this movie. Chihiro takes a train ride with 3 spirit characters all very different and unique in their looks and personality. The purpose of the ride is simply just to go from A to B. Its not important for the story, it does not advance the plot on the grand scale of things. It is just something that is simply there to look at.This scene had me in tears. Not because it looks sad, or the characters are tragic, or because the story at this point is so gut-wrenching (think of the opera music scene in Graveyard of The fireflies). It just pulls the emotion out of you because it is just so mesmerizing and beautiful to watch.This film which has just been released in North America, looks to be in limited release so far. I'll put it to you this way. I am not a major fan of Japanese anime, but I have seen a small handful of good ones. I was speaking with people after the show, and I ran into one guy who as he puts it, has seen SEVERAL anime movies. He said this is the best one he has EVER SEEN. Period.This film is going to be HUGE.. It just may get the North American public addicted to Japanese anime, an art form that has been nothing more in the eyes of America as an overly grotesque cartoonish immature art-form, that seems to be overtly sexualized, and overrun with violence and nonsensical stories. This film will not just break that barrier, it will be a tidal wave of movie history crashing through it with tsunami punch! If it DOES NOT... then anime does not even deserved to be shown in this country to be appreciated. I can't see this film not being a huge buzz within the next few days. The audience I was with which was very varied kids and adults of all ages, were entranced and applauded massively when this film was over in celebration.I can only think of one film I have seen that is of this level and would rank now as a tie after seeing this film for best film of the year (that would be Monsoon Wedding). A very different film obviously which can't be compared to this.This isn't just a great animated film. This isn't just a great Japanese film. This isn't just a great award winning film. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. Period.Rating 10 out of 10","

It is quite simple, an AWESOME BRILLIANT VISUALLY STUNNING BEAUTIFUL LOVELY RARE UNIQUE SPECTACULAR FILM! It's a must see for anybody who appreciates good animated movies with vivid imaginations. This film won an Oscar for best animated feature and a slew of other international awards worldwide and all very well deserved too.","

"Harmaa_Hevonen","7 September 2003","I never understood the art of anime, manga or whatever. Always thought it's something... just not for me. I saw several ""Robotech"" series while being a kid, but they never amused me the same way Western animations did. But when a friend of mine suggested me to see this one, saying her kids liked it much, I thought to myself: ""Anyway, why not?""...Well, may be I will never see anime again. Just because it's hard to imagine some other movie can be as good as this one. Screamingly-amazing, and no less. The characters, the music, the backgrounds are truly wonderful. A definitely must-see for everyone interested in animation regardless of it's time. Even people who dislike anime for some reason got to see this one. Truly educational experience, that is.The look of couple of characters was someway familiar to me. May be I saw something like that in Russian animation pieces of early 80's and 90's? Or is it just the Animation Spirit kidding around?","

"willwoodmill","14 February 2016","Every once in a while, someone with a great talent, and a beautiful vision gets the tools and funding they need to realize their vision, Spirited Away was one of those few, times. Hayao Miyazaki needs no introduction, he is the main director and co-founder of the best animation studio in the world, studio Ghibli. He made 10 films at studio Ghibli, nearly all of them masterpieces, Spirited Away was his 7th film, and his best. Spirited Away is one of the most original and creative films, scene after scene, there is nothing but new strand creatures, locations, and adventures, each scene is completely unforgettable and would be the high point in almost any other film. Spirited Away is about a 10 year old girl, Chihiro, who, after moving to a new town, finds herself lost in the spirit world, and has to find her way out. Chihiro is one of the most likable protagonists of any film ever, and she has one of the most well done character arcs ever. As the film goes on ever about slowly changes, from her attitude, speech, and even little things like her stance and facial expressions. She goes from being a weak willed child, to a strong, intelligent, hero. The animation in Spirited Away is probably some of, if not they best in any movie ever, with some of the best creature designs, and locations ever, not to mention the vivid background animation, and character movement, that flows so naturally during the more exciting scenes. Also apparently Hayao Miyazaki animated the film without a finished script and sort of made it up as he went along. Spirited Away was insanely well received every where around the world, it became the highest grossing film in Japan, beating movies like titanic, and in America it became the first non American film to ever win the Academy Award best animated feature, made it onto Roger Ebert's ""great movies."" And is often listed as one of the best animated films of all time, rightfully so. In my opinion the Best scenes in Spirited Away are the quiet ones where Chihiro just sits and takes in the amazing surroundings, like when she rides the train, and when she sits on the balcony of the bath-house during the night, these scenes have such a subtle beauty that can never be described in words. 10/10","

"robertrutledge","27 August 2021","I remember watching bits and pieces of this movie as a kid on Cartoon Network. Only recently was I able to sit down and watch it in its entirety. While it is indeed a very beautiful film, I was a little disappointed. It fell just short of the expectations I had reserved for it since my childhood. I will admit it is an interesting social commentary, a la George Orwell's Animal Farm. The fictional creatures and settings imagined by Miyazaki are as equally creative as they are fascinating and are what make the film stand the test of time.The story revolves around a young girl who has entered a spirit realm where her parents have been transformed into pigs. The girl must work scrubbing clients down at a gigantic, luxurious bath house to convince its owner to turn her parents back into humans and let them all return to the physical world. Along the way she makes many interesting friends, from both the spirit world and the physical world.I absolutely love the world building implemented here. The general atmosphere is like a Disney movie mixed with a Salvador Dalí painting. This, as opposed to the storytelling, is where the movie really shines. The characters are very entertaining and interesting as well. The character No Face, a spirit that looks like a black blob with a mask on, is particularly fascinating.While I did enjoy the story, the journey almost seemed too easy for the hero. I enjoyed the first half of the movie much more than the second half. The main villain, an old woman who can turn into a bird (and the owner of the bathhouse) makes for an interesting, yet not quite ""bad"" enough, antagonist. As far as villains go, while she may be interesting and memorable, she just doesn't seem very evil. Toward the end of the movie some plot twists are introduced which are slightly confusing and could have been more creative.This is a great movie. I am not so sure I would go as far as calling it a masterpiece, but it is close. It is certainly one of the treasures of the vast world of Japanese animation. I would recommend this movie to anyone, whether you're a fan of animé or not, child or adult. It's a movie about facing your fears and fighting for the ones you love. I will surely be watching it many more times in my life.","

"InzyWimzy","21 September 2002","This was a really fun film to watch.  Miyazaki's imagination depicts a whole other world through the eyes of young Chihiro.  The colors  radiate life especially the garden scene which looked awesome on a digital projector. The story's so straightforward but it's the journey of telling it that fascinates and draws you in from beginning to end.  I remember talking to friends after seeing it and we all had interesting points.  I felt the film focuses on Chihiro's innocence as compared with the other characters she encounters, but her child like views are so carefree (and naive at times) and her youthful exuberance  really makes it endearing.  Another friend said it was a coming of age and how Chihiro herself progresses throughout the film.  I mean, if you can find so much insight in a film, you know you have a great film.Spirited Away is not too dark and there are plenty of laughs throughout.  A definite buy on my DVD list.","

"MyOpinionIsFact","26 May 2003","I can count on one hand the number of animated films I thought achieved the potential of the medium. I am almost always disappointed by them; so much so that I've started to actively dislike the genre. After hearing all the praise for this movie, I really, really wanted to be proved wrong. Even though I found myself admiring some of the artistry in Spirited Away, overall I felt very letdown. First, like during almost every animated film that I see, I got a bad headache while watching it (if this always happens to anybody else, please contact me). Second, the main characters look far too cartoony compared to the lavishness of the background scenes. If someone can enlighten me as to *why* animators, from an artistic point of view, not pragmatic, choose to do this, let me know. Third, why do animated characters always have to be so clumsy? Here, it was part of Sen's development, but animated characters are always dropping things, slipping here, fumbling there. Sure, it can be used to convey dynamicism to the inanimate drawings but, for me, it is at the expense of realism. Lastly, besides the most trite of statements (e.g., pollution is bad, whining is bad, gluttony is bad, greed is bad, etc.), I find the movie without a deeper message. Or, among the messages it does hold, I find none of them presented movingly enough such that offenders would change their lifestyle. I did like the music and some of the comedy. And I admit that many of the visuals will stick with me for a long time. My favorite moment (no real spoiler) is when the hamster interacts with the footprint and the sootballs. What's puzzling about this little scene is that it is completely unnecessary and even detracts from the storytelling; yet it works. I gave the movie 5/10.","

"lee_eisenberg","28 December 2021","Hayao Miyazaki's ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" (""Spirited Away"" in English) is one of the most mystifying movies that I've ever seen. This story of a girl's quest to rescue her parents from an ugly fate is not like any animated feature that you've ever seen. As beautiful as it is horrifying, this movie is a true sui generis.Miyazaki noted that consumerism's effects on Japan is a theme. After all, Japan adopted a western diet and started seeing new kinds of health problems. What happens to Chihiro's parents is just an example of this.Anyway, an outstanding piece of work. I'm sure that it makes more sense to Japanese viewers, but foreign viewers will find plenty to like about it. The movie won a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Animated Feature (Hayao Miyazaki declined to attend in protest of the US invasion of Iraq).","

"jakebunker","8 July 2023","How is it that this movie even exists? What kind of divine inspiration was given to the creators of this movie? The craziest part of it is that I'm honestly kind of unsure how to explain why it is as good as people say it is, and I think many people feel the same way. It's just impossible to put into comprehensible words why it works. It just simply does. Maybe it stretches a bit too long, but that's really my only complaint. I can't give the reasons why you should watch it; you just should. That's all there is to it. It's literally a work of art that made me feel emotions I never knew were possible out of a movie. Maybe there are some weaknesses to it but I could care less. I felt so incredibly good after watching it that I could care less. How it works is beyond me and at this point I'm just rambling on. Just go on and go watch it, you won't regret it.","

First of all I do not think it deserves to be so high on that ladder. IMDb 250 is not so, according to my opinion, relevant to which films are so good. Some I would not put there, like this one.Yes, the cartoon was excellent, quality of it was outstanding. But I found plot too much for the kids. It was not for the adults like me, so I recommend you give it to the kids to watch and you take your wife out for a good dinner.Kids will be mesmerized by all those monsters and witches, but do not be crazy when kid wakes you up screaming frightened. ;)","

"Angry_Arguer","6 June 2004","The Concept: 'City of Lost Children' meets 'They Live' meets 'Beauty and the Beast'Spoiler Warning...If there's one good thing the insipid 'Harry Potter' series has done, it's helped marginally raise our understanding of magic.  Lynch tried explaining it with 'Dune'--the best attempt in a sci-fi setting.  None of that understanding is taken into account here, its only a lightshow.I am continuing my study of animation styles and this was one of several anime that I examined (the others being 'Vampire Hunter D', 'Akira', 'Golgo 13', and 'Mononoke Hime').  I noticed one consistent theme: the art styles are all the same.  Characters suffer from 'Pokemon' design.  One motif is interesting: giant, amorphous blobs.Here in America I've found at least four styles--the exaggeration method of Disney & Bluth, the CGI teams, the TV method of 'Heavy Metal' and its ilk, and the reality obsession of Bakshi.  It's taken us 80 years to reach this point.  Will the Japanese catch up?What really frustrates is the scant material in anime stories.  If a story leaves enough open ends for me to create another interpretation, I've just found my entertainment.  Example: 'Falling Down' is really a dream by Michael Douglas in the midst of a traffic jam.  Duvall is just a mental extension of himself that shoots him in the end.  Layman's terms: Douglas dreams of rampage, stalking and killing himself.  How good is that?We get no such opportunities here.  This isn't even 'Alice.'  Alice was about wordplay, integration of reality into fantasy, and surrealism.  Here we get some simple surrealism and nothing else, even the protagonist is sexless.The most interesting part is that Disney and Pixar managed the American release.  Since Disney's conventional team has quit, they are taking stock in anime in order to ride the popularity wave.  Disney should produce their own anime under Tony Scott or John Carpentar (since anime is identical to their styles).  The story would have the layering of 'eXistenZ' and the visual philosophy of 'Fight Club.'  Wouldn't that be cool?Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud","

"mtgtuga","27 January 2005","Rightfully named the greatest Japanese animation director, Miyazaki delivers again. This movie is definitely his masterpiece. Every single aspect (at least the good ones!) that you could possibly imagine is present and accounted for.After seeing Princess Mononoke, I sincerely believe Miyazaki to be gifted. Be careful in making wrong judgments just because it's an animation (hence a ""kid's movie"" according with the stereotypes); trust me, this movie will puzzle you beyond reason and it's much more effective in doing so than 99% of the so called ""real"" movies. Real life has never been so well depicted.. the story is pure fantasy, but the feelings, speeches, reactions are genuinely human.Perhaps most of you don't know (or just don't care), but every great hero/leader had his doubts, disbelieves and moments of weakness. What made them great, was not the absence of such feelings, but the will power to move forward when every single bone in their body told them to run for cover...And that, my friends, is exactly what this movie is all about.See it. I promise you it's time well spent.","

"Nearly_Headless_J","21 February 2008","This film works well with childrenbut works wonders with adults. Much like ""Alice In Wonderland"", it revolves around a world which appears to be extraordinary  but at the same time reflects many aspects of our own society, and the human nature. Miyazaki's quality of animation is brilliant as usual, much like his vision to create something so creatively profound, entertaining and intensely symbolic. A perfect example of the latter is an appropriately named character called No-Face. To me he appeared to be a reference to the many socially insecure people out there, who stay in the shadows but secretly crave for friendship. When Chihiro behaves in a warm manner with him, he is so overwhelmed that he becomes desperate to seek her attention and to make her happy in any way possible. Another symbolic aspect I found towards the end of the movie, was when Haku strictly told Chihiro not to ""look back"", until she had come out of the cave. This instantly reminded me of a Greek myth I had read as a child, - whereby a man who had gone to depths of Hell to bring back his dead wife, was instructed to do the same, but failed to comply due to his doubtful nature. Perhaps Miyazaki wanted to imply that by ""looking back"", Chihiro would have unknowingly expressed a hint of regret and this might have enabled Yu-Baba to seize her back into the magical land. Of course, there is also the rather abrupt ending  which I had found a bit weird at first but when I thought about it I realised that it was most probably done on purpose, to maintain an element of mystery in the viewer's mind, as to whether Chihiro and Haku were ever able to meet again or not. All said and done, I did have one complaint with the movieconsidering the story involved an extraordinary, magical land there was an enormous amount of scope and although I found the movie to be very intriguing  I feel that it could have been even more adventurous and exciting. That's just me. On the whole though, I can't deny the fact that this is one of the most unique, enthralling animation experiences I've ever had. My Final Rating: 8.5/10.","

"Echaad","3 March 2005","NOTE.. THERE MAY BE SPOILERS.. I AM NOT TRYING TO RUIN ANYTHING FOR ANYONE, BUT A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THIS MOVIE MUST NECESSARILY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS.. IT IS HOPED THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE, BUT IF YOU HAVE NOT, YOU MAY WISH TO JUST TAKE EVERYONE'S WORD FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS BRILLIANT AND NOT READ ANY FURTHER FOR NOW.Miyazaki is a genius and a true creator of Masterworks. ""Sen and Chihiro's Spiriting Away"" is a perfect example of that genius, subtle and very powerful messages couched in enjoyable and visually beautiful form. One thing: Please don't use the incorrect Americanized title.. it removes a key issue from the movie, that of Duality, and Miyazaki wanted it there, or he WOULDN'T have titled it that way in the first place. One more thing: Watching the dub ruins the movie. If you want Disneyesque storytelling without content, watch the dub. If you want Miyazaki's movie, watch it in the original with subtitles, please..Miyazaki holds the same views in all of his work.. ecology is always at the forefront.. as it was in ""Sen and Chihiro's Spiriting Away"".Spirited Away (for short) is important because it is the DUALITY that is at the core of the movie.. Duality.. Sameness.. what it is to be empty and how the hunger of emptiness can come to become an all encompassing NEED to ""swallow"" all that is around one.. That is saying something very significant about us. Miyazaki said that there ""is a little of No-Face in us all"" -- and that aspect of us, that ""No-Face"" with its hunger and need.. must find resolution. In Spirited Away, it was found through Zenobia, Yubaba's twin sister.. who gave No-Face the ""place"" he needed.. who gave that need and hunger that IS no-face, surcease, peace, finally.Greed is obvious, human greed, in simple aspects of the movie.. Chihiro's parents acting like ""pigs"" and in so, BECOMING pigs themselves. That's not overly subtle (although many miss it and thing it just a bit of humor), but it is powerful... ""be so, and you will become so"". Take what is not yours to take, and your punishment will be swift and unyielding.This carries over the environment as well.. and ties in nicely with two other factors.. the ""stink spirit"" which was NO STINK SPIRIT AT ALL.. but a powerful RIVER GOD.. who was so full of POLLUTION that he'd turned from something powerful and beautiful to a lumbering, stinking, barely able to move, thing of filth. That's a powerful image.When he is ""cleansed"" (by the small and innocent Chihiro who has done nothing wrong -- she is the innocent (yes, she's spoiled and a bit surly at the start, but she grows quickly. Painfully at times, but quickly.. almost losing her identity (again the duality theme.. She is both Sen AND she is Chihiro.. that's why the Japanese title referred to them BOTH as being ""Spirited Away"".When the River God is cleansed, you see what he REALLY is.. and he flies away, leaving Sen (for she is Sen at that time) a gift... a rare and powerful gift.Then we look at Haku.. Who, in the scheme of duality has LOST his other side, his true and other self.. you may recall that he was described as having changed and since he become Yubaba's apprentice, he has become ""more and more pale and steely-faced"" -- in other words, losing more and more of ""himself"" -- and yet, Yubaba is willing to simply discard him once he is bleeding and dying and ""of no further use to her""... but Sen/Chihiro WON'T let him die.Through the power of love, she brings him back -- only a love so strong could have saved him from the poisonous spell that was on the seal he stole from Yubaba's twin sister, Zenobia. But she over-rules that spell with her love, determination, and with the medicine, half of which she gave to No-Face to save HIM, and the other half of which she forces into Haku, to save HIM.. leaving her nothing to save her parents, but in the balance of ""whose need is greatest right NOW"" she acts correctly.Saving Haku.. and then helping him recover his name (and saving him in a more profound way by FREEING him.. as he freed her by giving her back her clothes and her card with her name on it.. she had almost lost herself at that point.. she'd forgotten her name.. results in him saving her as well.. They save each other.But WHY does Haku need saving? Because his river WAS FILLED IN. More Ecology.. we destroy, we pollute, we are GREEDY.. and the consequences are dire. Haku no longer has his river... the River God no longer can be clean due to our pollution.. and our greed turns Chihiro's parents into, LITERALLY, pigs..We *are* the pigs. We are greedy, we destroy, we pollute, we even ""stink"" (remember the references to Sen as ""smelling"" bad and no one willing to work with her because of her human ""stink""? That's very much to the point.. we stink because the things we do literally STINK.. we turn to black everything we touch.Miyazaki's message of duality, and ecology and salvation is very potent in Spirited Away... it's a very serious movie cloaked in the beautiful anime that makes watching it a pleasurable experience.. but if we just skim the surface and don't think about what is being said, we are as clueless and stupid as the parents who turn *themselves* into pigs.That too is a subtle message.. ""miss the point, and you're doomed to repeat it"". And turn yourselves into pigs.. or worse yet, remain as pigs.","

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","27 April 2008","""Spirited Away"" is a great film, but not great in the way that most Americans will think of movies. This film is an adventure unlike anything the western hemisphere has ever seen (unless of course you belong(ed) to your high school anime club). It's a story about simple, pure and true values, not a story about life's deepest questions and that's what separates it from the dominant form of ""Western"" films.The story is about a young girl named Chihiro who is moving with her parents to a new town when a stop along the way leads them to what appears to be an abandoned carnival. You get the feeling things aren't that simple and before Chihiro knows what hit her, she is in a spirit world and her parents have been transformed into pigs for gluttonously infringing on the spirit world. To return to her normal life and get her parents back, Chihiro must work at a spirit bathhouse led by a cruel witch named Yubaba.There is no explanation of what this world is in relation/comparison to the real world that the characters were in in the beginning, but once you get past that, it's all about the creatures, characters and bizarre events that happen. The world is unbelievably imaginative, combining both elements of conventional fantasy and ideas that are completely fresh. Whether it is the odd, but powerful creature named No Face, the multi-legged old boiler operator Kamajii or the bug-eyed, insane Yubaba, ""Spirited Away"" boasts an intriguing cast of characters.Most importantly, the film is about the values of love, friendship and helping others. We watch Chihiro, a sort of passive, ignorant girl learn (in some of the oddest ways) what it means to be selfless and giving and the film is her transformation into a better person. That's it. No deep criticism of humanity (other than don't be selfish), no questions about life, just a reinforcement of ideas that so often are either overlooked or expressed in uncreative, unoriginal ways. A children's film could have gotten the same ideas across, but ""Spirited Away"" shows that there are different ways to think about why those values are important.","

Nearly all of the stars given with this review come from the amazing visuals. Several of the shots in this movie are easily the most creative, beautiful, and straight up stunning pieces of art I've seen. But beyond that, there's not much else positive to say. A lot of the movie feels like an uncomfortable fever dream. There's no logic to any aspect of the story or characters. I guess some people found that appealing but it wasn't for me. I still recommend watching it purely for the visuals, but I'm personally disappointed in the rest.","

"sibelian","21 September 2006","I'm not really the sort of person who sits through a movie with a list of mental check-boxes that I need ticked before I can say I enjoyed it, or would give it a ""10"". We all have these little checkboxes and are mostly unconscious of them while were watching a movie, but can become painfully conscious of them when the movie leaves them unticked (no plot... grrr NO tick in little box... patronising exposition... grrr, NO tick in little box) and a lot of people who need certain of these boxes ticked will be annoyed by Spirited Away. It's plot is meandering and ""join the dots"" at best and its characters, when viewed objectively, are actually somewhat skewed, either too peculiar or too saccharine to relate to.But *I* don't care.I'm the sort of person who can forgive any number of flaws if there's anything in the movie resembling genuine imagination, particularly if it's used in a meaningful way. Sometimes only one sublimely imaginative moment will satisfy me and make the film something that I will love and treasure forever however bad the rest of it is. For this reason, I love the whole of, for example, ""The Dark Crystal"", however dated it seems and stilted and wooden the dialogue, because it just DRIPs with dreamy originality.*Every single scene* in Spirited Away seems to throb with a unique magic, it's a continuous *string* of these sublimely imaginative moments. To me, it has exactly the timeless wonder of Alice in Wonderland. And, amazingly, because writing a new fairy story is always very difficult, on an inexplicable fairy-tale logic level, it all rings true, hangs together and makes sense! Everything in this movie seems at once alien yet hauntingly familiar, like a particularly vivid and startlingly colourful dream. I felt, as the story unfolded, as if I had already seen it and loved it when I was a very small child, and had simply forgotten it.SPOILERS My favourite sequences are: 1. Just after Chihiro and her parents walk through the archway into the sun-drenched Field of Smiling Stones and the music seems to lift off the ground like a dandelion seed in a soft breeze. I have spent many happy days on islands of the coast of Scotland in the summer that felt just like that, awake yet dreaming, bright and beautiful.2. The water train sequence, which was strange and delightful. (That house on the tiny bit of land not much bigger than the house itself reminds me so *very* strongly of places I visited as a child on holiday in Scotland that I can hardly help but love it.)3. The Cleansing of the River God, which was wonderful! SPOILERS END One warning, this movie might be frightening for very small children. My 5 year old nephew found it a bit too spooky in places (but loved it), even though he laughed all the way through even the scariest bits of ""Twilight Zone The Movie""...Not *really* a kids movie, a movie for the kid inside adults...","

My daughter watched it with me every time and loved it as much as I did. It was an astonishing film, though scary at times, but wonderful the whole way through. It had some laugh out loud funny moments and the next minute you were on the edge of your seat and it all seemed so real. It really got me into anime. Since then I have also watched Howl's moving castle, which is fabulous. My daughter went one step further and learnt to draw manga. I must say she is quite good! She also is learning to play the opening theme on the piano. It's 4 pages long. Rather her than me! I would recommend this film to anybody. But be warned. It's very... different.","

"merisoch","5 June 2015","The first thing I did after I first finished watching this movie was to go on the IMDb website to check if it was, in fact, 124 minutes long. I wanted to ensure that my DVD wasn't messed up, and that I had watched the entire movie, because I was afraid I'd missed a few of its scenes. That's how confusing it had been the first time. I had to watch the movie again before I could understand it and make sense of the events. It might be confusing, but it is a great watch for the entire family, for both parents and children alike. No matter how old you are, you'll be able to connect to this movie and you will love it. I've often heard that this anime film is best-known for it's animation, but to me, the story's execution was most fascinating. A MUST-WATCH (and I'd recommend using subtitles no matter what language you're watching it in).","

"diac228","1 May 2006","Spirited Away is best-known for being the film that out of nowhere steals the Academy Award for best animated film from Lilo and Stitch and Ice Age, two very successful animated flicks that had come out at the same year. When I mean stole it, I do in fact mean stole it. Spirited Away is the kind of film that really points out what is wrong with animation today: not that much of a story, very inconsistent animation, lack of closure, and just too many slow moments. Clocking in at over two hours long, this is one of the longer animated movies to come out in recent years, and despite the few humorous moments, it isn't that great overall. Making an astonishing 200 million dollars overseas, it established Hayao Miyazaki as the ""Walt Disney of Japan.""This movie revolves around a clumsy yet courageous little girl named Chihiro who loses her parents because they ate food that belonged to spirits. As a result of this, she goes through a series of trials and adventures to get back to the regular world, or else be doomed to forever work in a bathhouse for spirits. Along the way, she meets up with Haku, a boy determined to take her back into the real world. Throughout the film, she meets an astonishingly large cast of characters, ranging from a greedy old lady that runs the bathhouse to some cute little spider-like critters. Along the way some of these critters help, some try to kill her, and others carry awful curses that plague their soul and also threatens to ruin the bathhouse.Miyazaki weaves an interestingly bizarre story, yet he stretches it way too long resulting in many dull and many, many slow moments. There are some scenes that way too prolonged and others that some may find utterly pointless. On the technical side though, there is a mixed bag. Unlike most translated animated films, this one stands out with very good voice work, and that is partly thanks to John Lasseter, otherwise known as one of the leading men of Pixar and director of the Toy Story movies.The animation on the other hand, is quite inconsistent. In several points of the film, there is an ugly mix of realistic animation with cartoony animation with an anime-style background. It doesn't mesh too well, seeing a realistically-drawn little girl with two goofy-looking animals and a very detailed old woman all together, sharing the spotlight for a minute or two. The mix of computer animation and regular animation doesn't work either. If you are going to work on a film, make it consistent, or at least make it look consistent. Beauty and the Beast contains some computer animation, but it is almost impossible to notice because it is done so well (The Beast dancing with Belle has the most computer animation in the film).As the climax rapidly approaches, it is hard to even find the mood. While on one hand there is suffering, in the corner of the screen there is some funny animation involving a hamster and a small bird trying so hard to keep up with the main character, Chihiro. It is hard to feel sorry and be saddened by the depressing cries of Chihiro, when we see the hamster trying to knit but to no avail. I found myself laughing during scenes in which there was supposed to be a gloomy mood, which is both frustrating and also embarrassing since I was watching it with some other people.Bottom Line: Best animated film of 2001? I don't think so, that title belongs to Ice Age. While it is an interesting and at times intriguing story, it is ruined by the conflicting animation, the amount of time it takes to tell the tale, and the failure to bring any drama when it is supposed to because of what is going on. The ending also arrives rather unexpectedly and comes up a bit short. While it sometimes looks pretty and sometimes is fun to watch, overall it is still lacking. At least it finally breaks the trend of Asian-made movies with bad dubbing by proving some excellent English-speaking voice talent. Spirited Away: won't blow you away, it will not totally frustrate you, but will not convince you to watch it again.","

"bobbie-16","8 May 2007","If you are not Japanese, definitely see this movie with the Japanese soundtrack and subtitles, not dubbed. The sound will then go with the gestures and facial expressions. The story is a great introduction to themes in Japanese culture. The words ""spirits"" and ""gods"" which are used interchangeably in the movie are translations of ""kami"" (you can see the term in the title in Japanese), which is a Shinto concept of a spirit being, not god as thought of by Jews, Christians, and Muslims (who might be offended by a ""stink god"") . Many things in nature are filled with this kind of spiritual power--rivers, winds, rocks, etc. (For example, kamikaze means ""divine wind"" and it referred originally to the two great typhoons that destroyed the Mongol fleets when they tried to invade Japan in the 1200s). As other reviewers have pointed out, the story is about Chihiro's transformation from a whiny brat to a self-reliant, courteous, compassionate and aware individual. The viewer may see a resemblance to Memoirs of a Geisha in the heroine's maturation from a frightened little girl traumatically separated from her parents to a servant who must start at the bottom of the hierarchy and finally to a self-reliant and successful person. Another theme that is similar is the character of the greedy, powerful, witch-like owner of the establishment. Yubaba is contrasted to Zeniba; the former's home is ""in bad taste"" with a lot of imported ornate stuff (from chinoiserie to western-style furnishings) whereas Zeniba's cottage is very wabi-sabi (rustic-archaic) and simple, hearkening back to traditional Japanese design. Another thing I liked about the movie was its complete acceptance of a girl-protagonist (whereas girls are often treated as ""second-best"" in American movies). Japanese gender hierarchy and women's ""submissiveness"" are not as simple as some folks think. In early Japanese history, women were very powerful and autonomous figures--politically powerful, writers, etc. Originally the society was matrilocal and women had considerable say in their personal lives. The emperor is the descendant of the sun-goddess. Women's status declined in the samurai period and the Meiji Restoration, but there are still traces of their originally higher status and importance. So Spirited Away is not only fun entertainment but also a little introduction to themes and values of Japanese culture.","

"khanbaliq2","20 September 2009","Spirited Away is perhaps the Miyazaki film that appeals most to adults, and it also happens to be one of his strangest. The film views a sullen ten-year-old girl in the middle of her family's move to the suburbs and an awkward wander into a world ruled by gods, witches, and monsters; and a bathhouse for these creatures. The film received many awards, including the second Oscar ever awarded for Best Animated Feature, the first anime film to win an Academy Award. The film also won the Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival. Spirited Away overtook Titanic in the Japanese box office to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history.Spirited Away happens to be my favorite Studio Ghibli film. It's also undoubtedly one of the studio's best films. It's a testament to director Hayao Miyazaki's creativity that he managed to make this masterpiece so late in his career. The animation is just gorgeous. The use of color is fresh and vibrant. All the backdrops have so much detail that even if you watch the film more than once you'll still see something that you didn't notice before. Even though the film is a fantasy Miyazaki still made it as realistically as he could. For example, when Chihiro runs, she runs realistically like a little girl. It's these little details that made me like the film even more. Even though the setting is very much Japanese it's still possible to see what influenced Miyazaki (not just in Spirited Away but in his other films too). There are American influences but there are also Russian influences. Miyazaki has stated that the 1957 Soviet film The Snow Queen is one of his inspirations to work in animation. When he started his career, Miyazaki had a rough start and was thinking of leaving animation already. When he saw The Snow Queen, he admired it and continued working in anime. In September 2007, it was announced that Studio Ghibli will be distributing this film through their Ghibli Museum Library label. The plot of Spirited Away resembles that of several popular Russian fairy tales. A girl who enters a strange land, meets strange creatures, and then manages to return home. I've seen it before. Yubaba was obviously influenced by Baba Yaga, a witch-like character in Slavic folklore (her magic, her big nose, her ability to fly like a bird, and that she's the master of some place). All this may seem strange at first, but it just adds to the uniqueness of Spirited Away. This time composer Joe Hisaishi delivers a pleasant yet beautiful score. The highlight of the soundtrack is the closing song Always With Me, performed by Yumi Kimura. As in most of his films, Miyazaki includes his thoughts on the environment, childhood, friendship, work and manners. These become good lessons in the film. In conclusion, Spirited Away easily earns a perfect rating from me. I give it my highest recommendation, and it's on my list of the top ten films.","

"KellyRikDixon","1 January 2005","Chihiro and her parents are driving to their new house. She's upset to leave her old friends and school. When her father gets them lost in the woods, they stumble across what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. Chihiro wanders off and is sucked into a bath-house in a new world, a world of spirits. Chihiro is guided by Haku, henchman of the witch who controls the bath-house. The two of them work hard together to help Chihiro escape and rescue her parents. The youngster proves herself to be as independent as any spirit and fights through many distractions and inconveniences to return to her own world. Even though she's scared and upset, she makes some close friends among the eccentric characters she meets.I've loved Miyazaki's work as long as I have known it but nothing compares to the experience of Spirited Away. I had not heard of the movie and had seen no trailers, so the unexpected animation was almost perfect. The characters were quite unique and no sane viewer would refuse the offer to follow the child in her enchanting adventure.For years, I've always thought that one of the most important factors of a good movie is the way the title is presented at the beginning and there is no better example to prove my point than in this film. The music is completely overwhelming, especially the attractive sequence displayed at the beginning and repeated throughout.There is very little criticism available, only that it's possible that the unique imagination of Hayou Miyazaki is not appreciated to the extent it should be by the viewers.I've read other reviews and think it's unfair to compare the work with Disney's as the last thing I would call this feature is a 'children's' movie. The two styles are aiming at different audiences and both succeed.","

"killbillroxxorz","24 May 2005","Was on the old Atari forums one day and searching through the movie section of the forum and I saw a thread on a Spirited Away movie. I have always been a big fan on Anime; I like Cowboy Bebop, Bubblegum Crisis, Neon Genesis and Kenshin. So when I continued reading it got great feedback from my friends on there. So once it came out on DVD I rented it and I must say, one of the best animation movies I've ever seen. The passion in the movie is extravagant, the animation is beautiful and the voice acting is astonishing.The story is about a little girl named Chihiro and her family, they are moving to a brand new house. On there way to there house there dim-witted father takes a short cut which leads them to what seems to be a abandoned old style Japanese amusement park where traveling through they find some food. Even though Chihiro's objection the Parents stuff there faces, which strangely enough turns them into pigs. Things get worst, she loses her way she came back and there are ghost like spirits around her. Her only way to get her parents back is help out by a boy naked Haku. She must meet the main boss of the Bath House, Yubaba, to retrieve them back. She must work for her food and to fight to get her parents back. Along with getting her name back! The evil Yubaba changes it to Sin. On the way she meets a text book of characters featuring my favorite, No Face.The animation in this film is stunning, vibrant colors, stunning backdrops and character design are great! The voice work is done perfectly, bringing across the emotion that is written in this script. Famous anime director Hayao Miyazaki who won an Oscar for this masterpiece has done well and should be proud of his years of work. Which include movies like Princess Mononoke etc.I suggest if you want to see a powerful, moving and up lifting movie that make you forget its an animation film, watch this film ASAP!","

"kvala_530","19 April 2004","A wonderful, wonderful movie! You don't often see movies that fill you with warmth and happiness. This is one of them though. I had not too high (but not low) expectations of an animated Japanese movie, but I was soon charmed by the brave little girl Chihiro and fascinated and swept away by her adventures. The characters are complex and there are mysteries that don't get explained in the movie, which is nice for a change. In most children's movies we get to see these days, every thing is laid out bite-sized, and nothing is left unexplained. Spirited away is much more daring in that respect. And with right: children do not need to see everything explained, they can enjoy a story just as much if it is mysterious.I give this movie a 10 because it managed to transport me to a fairy tale world and bring me back happy and content. I still think of it at times, even though it was a while back I saw it.","

"0rganism","18 January 2004","Some movies you just have to see to believe.  Spirited Away is one of them. Now I'm something of an anime/manga fan, but my wife is definitely not, and she LOVED this movie.  My young son also has become something of a Miyazaki fan, thanks to the DVDs of his movies.  (We now give a rousing ""Studio Ghibli"" cheer at the beginning of this and other Miyazaki films.)My wife and I saw Spirited Away in a theatre, and unlike some japanimation I've seen, this does belong on a large screen.  However, it might be too intense for younger viewers.  It translates quite well to DVD, so no complaints there, but the amazing color pallete and generally high artistic quality deserve a vivid presentation.I've heard and read complaints that some of the themes were too culturally-specific, that it would be impossible for an American unversed in Japanese mythology to understand the film.  Well, that suits me just fine; I rather like the sense of strangeness that comes with not quite knowing how all the themes tie together.  Perhaps it helped me identify with the main character, Chihiro, who as a young girl used to a technological society certainly isn't in a position to know the details of bathhouses for spirits.I really enjoyed the notion that if one goes just a little off the beaten track of modern Japan, one finds beautifully anachronistic spirit worlds. Fortunately, we didn't have to go too far afield to find Miyazaki's beautiful flight of fancy.  This film succeeds as a morality play on the pitfalls of carelessness and greed, as a comment on the persistence of deep cultural roots despite technological homogenization, and as an inspirational fairy tale of a girl who has to accept her extremely peculiar lot for the sake of her family.Impressive. 9/10.","

"bigben5","8 September 2002","* YES, IT DOES CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERSSpirited Away is a story about Chihiro, a smart young girl who - thanks to her parents stupidity -  end up getting lost in a sacred forbidden city where spirits come to bath and relax. But you already knew that before reading.I can tell you up front that the story is pretty much a copycat version of Alice in Wonderland, only with a much darker plot. For example, in the preview you don't get to see Chhiro's parents mutating into pigs after eating the forbidden food there. Nor is the fact mentioned that the guy who turns into a dragon does so because he sold his life to witchcraft. Or is even mentioned that part of the scary old women's pets is three decapitated heads rolling and jumping around. So think twice, about it if you want to bring kids to this movie ( then again Disney probably cut all that out, or adlibed it differently to change the story). My little cousin, from what I hear ran out of the theatre scared as hell... but then went back in later on because he was curious to see how it would end.
So how about good points?. Well, I can tell you that the animation is superb. I mean really good. It's a mileu - where you get to wonder in awe of the scenery , rather than concentrate on the story. The music is also very well orchestrated, giving a great overall feel to the movie.
Now the bad points. The plot stinks. I mean it, there are literally so many holes and details that if you're not paying attention to the whole thing, you'll get confused very soon. The question, as to whether or not Chirhio is able save her parents is pretty obvious and as to why you would care is another question that never gets answered. Overall, after seeing the movie you'll feel it's pretty pointless.  Oh yes, and they also dubbed it - another bad thing. I can tell by watching the preview that the dialogue has changed. I watched the chinese version - and there is a difference. So , should things not make sense , just blame the translators.So what's my judgement?  YES - go and see it. The movie, I think is worth seeing at least once, especially on the big screen, and no more afterwards.","

"Quinoa1984","27 September 2002","Spirited Away, the latest film from writer/director Hayao Miyazaki (a genius to Disney animators, such as to Toy Story director Lasseter who executive produced the film for the US), is a wonderful family film, that works on numerous levels for kids, not the least being the creative storyline, and for older kids and adults there are lavish backdrops and characters right out of, well, an anime movie. The storyline, by the way, follows a girl and how she finds herself in a fantasy world where her parents have been transformed into pigs and spirits and other strange creatures prowl the landscape, and she has to everything she can to stay human and get a way back home, thought she'll need help along the way. A bit at times reminiscent of a Wizard of Oz or Alice In Wonderland in Japanese anime fashion (perhaps building just on the fantasy elements as Miyazaki usually does) doesn't disappoint for a moment as a marvel of imagination. Even those strident fans of maturer (err extra violent) anime pictures will want to look, maybe more than once. Works on many levels and I recommend it of course, if maybe a mild mark under Miyazaki's best work Princess Mononoke. Grade: A (or 9.5/10)","

Not only does it represent the very best in animated storytelling available, it also puts most live action features to shame! Miyazaki has delivered some amazing movies in the past (like Laputa, Naussica and Princess Mononoke), but this time around his story and execution are so brilliant that Spirited Away soars in stratospheric altitudes. By the time Chihiro and friends embark that train during the third act, under Hisaishi's haunting score, you are certain you are witnessing a monumental epic.","

I had picked up an import copy of this film prior to the English Disney release and was stunned at how much I didn't like it. Thinking I was mad after all the hype I watched the film seven times in the next seven days and was underwhelmed each time. When the John Lasseter supervised dub was finally released to theaters I went more to show support than out of desire to see the film again. Seeing the film in English was a revelation. Even for some one who has watched thousands of anime in Japanese I had to admit that the tiny little touches that were added made the film better and more understandable on an emotional level. This is a great film for everyone, but if English is your first language see it in English its so much better.","

But that almost makes the film even worse, it feels like a lost chance at making a very good film with both great animation *and* a good script. I found this film severely lacking in that last department. I can not understand why it is ranked so high on the top 250 (at the time of writing this around spot 40). None of the characters' actions seem motivated and they are very badly developed. It seems like the person responsible for the ""story"" here just throw a lot of 'cute' and weird characters in and made the whole thing an obvious reference to Alice in Wonderland and thought the rest would solve itself. It didn't. The end result is that you just don't care. The pace is very slow. A lot of things may happen but the film doesn't draw you in. I think that many of the problems with the film ""Princess Mononoke"" was repeated in this anime. I thought this was so bad it was provocative, I wanted to leave before I had seen half of it, but I sat in the middle of the row so I endured the rest and the movie never got any better.

"manicman84","11 August 2006","In my opinion, ""Spirited Away"" is certainly the best animated movie ever. The quality of animation is obviously rousing and leaves no doubts who is the greatest master of contemporary animation. Hayao Miyazaki created fantastic, surrealistic world with great reverence. Every shot from this film can be regarded as a work of art as well as every single scene takes my breath away to such an extent that I can't even point out which one made the biggest impression on me. Nevertheless, the beautiful workmanship is not only virtue of this flick as ""Spirited Away"" provides also extremely coherent plot. It occurs that Miyazaki's imagination has no limits. The main heroine is entangled in a series of unexpected events having their roots probably in the mythology. The story develops through and extensively uses the main heroine. All characters are incredibly likable, which unceasingly attracts viewer's attention. ""Spirited Away"" is a very universal parable which works on many levels and offers, at the same time, a unique experience. Thus, I consider this film an absolute masterpiece and I highly recommend it regardless of age and any other factors.","

"I_am_Jacks_Revenge","13 March 2007","This movie made me love Hayao Miyazaki, because I hadn't even heard of him when I first watched the movie entirely (When I first watched it, I only saw part of it). I really love the title since it goes well with Chihiro's experience of being sent away by some sort of 'spirit' to a magical world. For some reason, I haven't seen 'Howl's Moving Castle' and I so want to see this movie because, like this movie, I am really interested in it. Okay. So, Chihiro gets into this mess because, as we could relate, her dad doesn't look for directions to their new home (the, uhh, scenic route). They enter a 'market'like place and Chihiro's parents start eating the food. Chihiro wonders off, and finds the bathhouse when who should appear but Haku, telling her to get out before it's too late, and she finds her parents turned into pigs. Haku tells her to look for a job, or she'll be sent to Yubaba, the head honcho of the whole bath house. There, her name is changed to Sen. She meets Lin, who is her roommate/helper to help her with her job. A spirit named No-face comes and starts eating customers and workers, but is really interested in Sen. She refuses, and No-face goes berserk (I think). She leaves to find Yubaba's twin sister, Zeniba. Haku (who can turn into a dragon, as he is a dragon when we see him at this part), shows up and gives Chihiro a ride back to the bath house. Along the way, Chihiro remembers a time when she thinks Haku saved her and she reveals his name, Kohaku River. She makes a deal with Yubaba, and tries to figure out which pigs out the group are her parents. She realizes that none of them are her parents. The contract she signed is ripped, and she's free. She meets her parents at the end, and looks back when they reach the end of the tunnel where their car was left. She looks back and gets into the car, ready to begin her life in her new home. And that does it. Thank you, Miyazaki, for a great movie.","

"tord-1","26 September 2003","Miazaki's Spirited Away is a masterpiece in every respect and is a milestone in animated film by its warmth, complexity and richness - the old Disney films feels very feeble in comparison.The basic story is not much different from many other animated stories, about a seemingly normal world that proves to be enchanted, where humans, occasionally, intermix with gods and ghosts, with unexpected results.Compared to Miazaki's earlier works, like My Friend Totoro, Porco Rosso and Princess Monoke, it presents an even more complex and fantastic world than any of these, and yet they are closely related. In My Friend Totoro there are a few supernatural creatures, in Porco Rosso there is a man who has been turned into a pig by a curse, in Princess Monoke the gods battle with humans, while in Spirited Away we have a multitude of gods, ghosts, a few humans, like the heroin's parents, that like Porco Rosso has been turned into pigs.Complex sagas about the battle of good and evil, and that the good can become evil and vice versa.Spirited away just does it to the n-th degree.a 10/10, without doubt!","

"blackmamba99971","30 March 2010","I have to say that as far as movies for kids go, this took me by surprise. I enjoyed every minute of it, from the oddball characters of the hot spa, to the really weird characters that were the guests. A story of a little girl thrust into a world of the unknown, because of her parents eating food made only for the spirit world. When they turned to pigs, she had to save them by becoming a temporary spirit working in the lavish spa. Working under a witch named Yubaba, a kind of mean streaked yet fair witch who oversees her employees. In giving her a job, Sen then tries to make the best of it working with the other help and to make sure the guests are looked after and cared for. It is quite hard at first but then becomes more attentive. In the midst of this, she also has a friend who is also a dragon, but can be humanoid when he sees fit to do so. Sen's duty ultimately leads her outwards to the spirit lands where she meets Yubaba's twin sister to return a seal which the dragon stole under the tutelage of Yubaba herself. All in all, this was a beautiful movie for scale, characters, the idea that being spoilt has its downfalls. And Sen really learn-ed the hard way. She got to do an honest days work, make lots of friends, and become a kind of grand daughter to Yubaba's twin sister. Her journey was breath taking, a marvel in film making.","

Miyazaki has created an amazing world and he totally immerses the viewer within it using every available tool of the trade.  The animation, the story, the music, the characters, everything.  If I start to rave about it I wont stop.  If you have children, take them to see it.  If you're a child at heart, see it.  Even if you're of the mature, adult variety, see it!

"Cineanalyst","5 September 2020","""Spirited Away"" is a seemingly simple fairy tale of animation, but it was made and released during the revolution of computers in the art form. A contemporary movie and the prior winner of the Best Animated Feature Oscar, ""Shrek"" (2001) was fully committed to this new style, all the while mocking with jokes aimed towards adults the hand drawing of yesteryear as represented by Disney. ""Spirited Away"" was more sparing in its employment of computer animation, entirely childlike in its wonder, and maintains the appearance and actuality of hand drawings and, moreover, the economical limited animation made its own style in anime. Both pictures feature amusement parks, the business for which the house of mouse conglomerate makes much of its money. For ""Shrek,"" this was a joke, but in ""Spirited Away,"" entry into an abandoned amusement park, which although it turns out to be primarily a bathhouse, is an adventure to the past, of a world of ghosts and transformations, of a hand-crafted and filmed animation. It's also compelling how the fairy-tale plot fits into this, with Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"" being the most apparent Western influence in this regard--particularly, after the rabbit-hole analogy, the chapter ""Pig and Pepper.""Thus, ""Spirited Away"" is a cartoon and children's story subtextually about cartoons and children's stories. As the world of animation was facing the transition to CGI, the girl protagonist in the story, Chihiro, is anxious over her family's moving to a new home, but not before a visit to spiritual ancestors--complete with that hero's journey by way of the memorable train sequence. Like Alice and the rabbit hole, Chihiro and her parents enter a tunnel and doorway to a room on their way into another world. We also get a sense of Chihiro falling, later, down a staircase. After entry, the parents presently transform like the baby of Wonderland into pigs. Furthermore, as in Carroll's story, there's a lot of emphasis in ""Spirited Away"" on the role of food in changing characters, and every important figure, at one point of another, takes on another form, a doppelgänger or faces an identity crisis--as Chihiro does with her new name of ""Sen."" If Chihiro/Sen is Alice and her parents pigs, then the witch Yubaba is the Duchess, including a baby of her own, as well as her being the only character evidently inspired by John Tenniel's illustrations for Carroll's text.All of this is relatively slight, actually, as far as cinematic Wonderland references go, of which I've been seeking a bunch since reading the Alice books. I appreciate what Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli do in exploiting ""Alice in Wonderland"" and fairy tales in general, though. Carroll's books were episodic, and the plot was never that important, as it is with ""Spirited Away."" Carroll filled his pages with wordplay, parodies and games of logic. Besides maybe the unintended pun in English of the ""No-Face"" character wearing a ""Noh"" mask, language and logic aren't the focus of ""Spirited Away,"" or at least don't appear as such to a non-Japanese speaker, and the filmmakers borrow freely and depart as quickly from Disney, other cartoons and other fairy tales rather than parody or mock them. Apt for a primarily visual art form, then, the otherly world here is reserved as a place for spectacle: colorful hand drawings, strange creatures, cartoon and fairy-tale transmogrifications, and sweeping movement and adventure. Additionally, the animation is inherently reflexive of the filmmaking process, of not living beings, but spirits being projected, of doppelgängers (as with the witches) and transmutations. In a sense, Chihiro enters a movie, a film-within-film, through that tunnel.""Spirited Away"" is such an enchanting picture, it's hard to fault it for anything. Probably my only reservation is that ""camera"" movement and film grammar leans towards the prosaic. There is some imagination with the drowning montage and running effects, but even Miyazaki's characteristic fascination with flying doesn't necessarily correspond with a freedom of motion with the framing. Nevertheless, it's a beautiful picture and an enthralling take on the fairy-tale genre.","

And i can say that no matter how much of the movie i watched, nothing became any clearer.It's a huge nothing burger, with characters that don't make sense, and don't have time to allow you to make sense of them.Credit where it's due. For the time it was made, YES, the animtion is good.The writing just made no sense and was WAY too random way too frequently.I'd try to watch it again, but I'm not interested.I've thought of asking friends to explain it, but maybe I'll just keep this one to myself.I'd give less stars, but I really didn't dislike it, so much as just simply not get what people love so much about this ""masterpiece"".","

"spider_webster","5 June 2005","This is the first ever anime I have ever cried at. Ever. Honestly, this movie teaches us lots of life lessons and about growing up. The animation is also great. Plus, this is my first Miyazaki film I have seen so I'm quite impressed.This movie is so much better than the current Disney films and though the animation isn't as good, but the detailed world is far more fascinating. I really feel that I've learned tons from 'Spirited Away' and for me, it means a lot.So far, this is the only other anime I've liked since Inuyasha and Naruto and it's the first ever movie version of one. I am very impressed by how well Miyazaki did for it.My favourite scenes are the time after Haku and Chihiro see Chihiro's parents in the flower field and the scene at the end. This movie is also in easy Mandarin so for those who aren't fluent with it can easily catch on.Overall, this is the perfect movie if you just feel down on life or when you think that you want to just see a good movie. It's one of the best I've ever seen and I definitely recommend it to you.Scored: 10/10","

There were no big explosions or extended CGI or 3-D figures, but it has plenty of rich imagery, a wacky yet poignant story and great animation.

"SolidSnake86XX","28 September 2003","Well, what a surprise; ""Miyazaki"" and ""masterpiece"" together in an affirmative sentence.  Spirited Away marks Miyazaki's first work as a semi-retired director, though the movie doesn't suffer from it in the least. Spirited Away is about a young girl gets lost in a world of ghosts and spirits and is forced to work at the bath house for specters.  Any fan of Miyazaki will instantly fall in love with this movie.  Don't be fooled by Disney's involvement or the fact that it's animated.  It's still very much anime, but not anime for anyone.  This is a good movie for young children and those who have a timeless love for movies.  If you're the kind of person who still loves Toy Story, for example, then this will become another one of your favorites.  People who are only into anime like Ninja Scroll and Cowboy Beebop, this may not be the movie for you.  This is a movie for those who love anime of all kinds, like myself.  Spirited Away is a fanciful movie that most open-minded individuals will enjoy.  I'd have to give it a 9.25 out of 10.","

"emptymask","20 February 2005","Normally I am detested by Japanese Animated features. I come from a background of loving many of the old Warner Brothers cartoons, and saw Jap-Animation as a threat, along side of Mtv, Nickelodean, and Cartoon Network, ruining children's cartoons. (I really prefer not to elaborate because I don't want to push any buttons on this board.) But this movie was phenomenal, its very rare that I am impressed by modern cartoons now days but this film dazzled me so much that I had to rewind the film and watch it again the next day. There is so much neo-mythology and Post Alice Traumatic Stress Syndrome in this movie that I was tickled, honestly. There is a lot of imagination and colorful ideas and I wish that there can be many more animated pictures of this quality to come in the future - the movie resembled a lot of the wacky weirdness that were around in the old Betty Boop or Silly Symphonies cartoons, the animators really touched a chord in me and I thank them full heartedly.","

"Vartiainen","13 January 2020","Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away is a story of Chihiro, a young girl moving to a new town with her parents, who gets trapped in the realm of spirits when she and her parents explore an abandoned holiday resort. There she must learn to cope with hostile beings, unexplained rules and the fact that her parents have been cursed into pigs for their crimes.The film has been compared to Alice in Wonderland, and there's a lot of truth to that. Chihiro and Alice are rather alike in their general demeanour and character. Chihiro is a bit more sullen, whereas Alice takes it all a bit more in stride. You definitely feel like Chihiro is in more danger throughout the film. But both Wonderland and the spirit bathhouse operate using logic not belonging to the human realm.And that's one of the best things about this film. Its world is a strange one and there's always a new surprise around the corner. But for some reason it all makes sense. Like there's this scene where Chihiro and Haku, her new protector, have to cross a bridge and he tells her to hold her breath or she'll get noticed. Does that objectively make any sense? No, but in that instance it's completely logical. You just get it. Holding your breath makes you invisible to spirits. Makes perfect sense.And the whole movie is like that. Apparently Miyazaki got his inspiration for the film by watching his young nieces and other relatives playing around. Which makes a lot of sense if you've seen the film. It is internally consistent and you always feel like its following rules. But they're the rules of a child's imagination.Furthermore, it's gorgeously animated, very well voice acted, with fantastic characters, songs, ideas and locations. It's a movie that you could play on mute and it'd still be one of the best movies you've ever seen. Likewise if you only heard it playing from another room. It's both child-like and surprisingly mature at the same time. Most character start out scary, alien and a bit threatening, but quite a lot of them have become your friends by the end of it.My personal favourite. One of the few films I'd call perfect. Please, if you're ever going to see even one Japanese animated film, makes it this one.","

"Vartiainen","28 January 2016","To me, this is the most real film I've ever seen. And it's an animated fantasy film inhabited by spirits, witches and dragons. It takes place in a Japanese bathhouse of all things and is full of magic, strange and new worlds, gods and mystical events. And yet I've learned more from it, identified more with its characters, than from any other film. Hayao Miyazaki is that good of a storyteller.Now, what do I mean by saying it's real? Simply put, it feels like I've known these characters my entire life. Chihiro, or main character, is a young girl moving to a new town, but on their way there, her family happens upon what seems like an abandoned holiday resort. Unfortunately, things are not as they seem, and her parents get captured into the spirit world, inhabited by gods and spirits. And now she has to accept responsibility for the first time in her life and stand on her own feet in order to rescue her parents.But that's not the only story line. We also have Haku, her mysterious helper, who has been captured as well, in his own way. We have Yubaba, the witch owner of the bathhouse, who seeks to enslave Chihiro by stripping everything from her, including her name. We have Kamaji and Lin, who work at the bathhouse. And we have No-Face. All these characters seem like they could easily be the focus of the movie, each of them having a very detailed and rich backstory, which we get to explore as the movie goes on, but it never feels like it's too much. The story lines support one another in a way I've almost never seen anywhere else. Miyazaki has woven it tight and whenever I see the film I find new or forgotten ways in which the events work together.It's also a beautiful film. Out of all Studio Ghibli films, only Princess Mononoke can compete with it in terms of beauty, quality and grandeur of animation. The colours, the character designs, the small touches and details. All wonderful. The score by Joe Hisaishi is also fantastic. It's a bit more downplayed than say Mononoke, not containing quite so memorable tunes and themes, but it's still beautiful and supports the storytelling perfectly.This is about as close to a perfect film as you can get. At least, for me. I think Doug Walker said it best in his review. It's a film so good that it makes you jealous. It's a story so good that you wanted to be the one to tell it. Well, that might be true for me as well, but I still enjoy the film above all else. I love it, I respect it and I'm going to see it regularly for the rest of my life.","

"JTurner82","20 March 2005","As with Miyazaki's films, SPIRITED AWAY is a magical tapestry of sights and sounds filled with exotic creatures, mythical settings, and, for its heroine, a little girl named Chihiro who is cute and sweet and thankfully not a selfish brat or bad-tempered hysterical bitch (unlike some of the other Anime I was watching around this time period). She starts off as initially sulky, but mainly because of a situation we can all relate to: she is moving with her parents to a new home, and thinks that her new life is ""gonna stink"". She becomes understandably panicked and suspicious when her parents decide to cross through a forbidden tunnel to a restaurant-filled village where they gobble up food that is sacred and cursed. Yes, CURSED -- her parents are transformed into pigs! To free her mother and father, Chihiro must find work at the town's central bathhouse (populated with all sorts of bizarre and unconventional spirits). The bathhouse's contemptuous owner, a greedy sorceress named Yubaba (who has, MY GOODNESS, THE HUGEST BABY I HAVE *EVER* SEEN!), grudgingly agrees, and in doing so renames her Sen. Although our ten-year old heroine is at first frowned upon by many of the bath house workers, Chihiro finds true friends in Kamaji, the six-legged(!) boiler man, Lin, the gruff but loyal bath house woman, and of course, Haku, a mysterious pale-faced boy whom Chihiro seems to have a deep connection with....To reveal anything more about this masterpiece would be a crime, but I will emphasize that the artistry is jam-packed with weirdness, imagination, and creativity, from the bathhouse's exotic-looking guests to a mysterious shadowy specter called No Face, who voices anyone he swallows -- and tempts people with gold. The sceneries also deserve special recognition; every location in the film, from the bathhouse's atrium to a breathtaking train ride across a glossy seabed (my personal favorite sequence in the movie) is painted with love and care... so stunning that one feels tempted to grab it like candy. Joe Hisaishi's music score, although not as memorable as some of his earlier works for Miyazaki, is a fabulous accompaniment for the picture; some of the tunes work better for the scenes than as a listening experience. The characters, as always, are believable, full-fledged, and multi-faceted -- there are no cardboard cut characters or caricatures present.Under the supervision of John Lasseter, a longtime fan of Miyazaki (and creator of many PIXAR productions, most notably TOY STORY, MONSTERS INC., and FINDING NEMO), and Disney director Kirk Wise, the film was dubbed into English -- with phenomenal results that rank with Disney's previous dubs for Miyazaki's films. The cast is quite good, although Daveigh Chase's performance as Chihiro is a little too shrill and whiny at times (albeit excellent overall). Out of the performers who lend their vocals to the characters (including Jason Marsden in what is probably his best role yet, Lauren Holly, Susan Egan, Michael Chiklis, Lauren Holly, and even a cameo from PIXAR regular John Ratzenberger), it is Suzanne Pleshette who steals the show; she plays Yubaba's greedy, loud-mouthed nature, pampering maternal side to her baby, and her twin sister, Zeniba (who, by the way, is the opposite of Yubaba -- she is IDEALLY Granny!) to perfection.I wouldn't say it is the best Miyazaki dub, though. Practically all of them have been excellent (not counting WARRIORS OF THE WIND, which I haven't seen), and I am therefore reluctant to compare the Disney/Ghibli English tracks to one another as a result. But SPIRITED AWAY's dub, although a bit too overrated IMO, is absolutely well done, and I commend everyone involved.SPIRITED AWAY received a modestly successful limited theatrical release in America, but it made many of the Top 10 Best Films of 2002 lists and even earned a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Animated Feature of 2002. Indeed, it is almost an understatement to say that if it were not for it's success in America, Disney probably would not have decided to go ahead and release a good remainder of Miyazaki's first-class, imaginative output.","

"drqshadow-reviews","11 September 2014","A young girl is drawn into a transparent world populated by gods, spirits, monsters and fantasies, where she struggles to understand the ground rules amidst the bustle of a busy bath house. This setting - unmistakably Japanese - provides endless amounts of nourishment as a massive showpiece of imagination, attention to detail, fancy, delight and cultural lore. There's more going on in the backdrops of Spirited Away's throwaway scenes than many of its contemporaries can manage to plaster up-front and center. It's a bit less focused than Princess Mononoke, which preceded it in the Miyazaki timeline, but that's because it's such a decidedly different, strange creature altogether. Here we're taking the time to embrace and celebrate the inherent weirdness of Studio Ghibli's world, where I could happily sniff daisies and people-watch for the rest of my days. The primary storyline is steadfastly unpredictable, twisting and writhing like a wild beast caught on a leash, but is able to, with time, pluck most every last plot thread and leave us all with a deep sense of satisfaction. Ambitious, fiery, awe-inspiring and diverse, it's worth repeated viewings amidst audiences of all ages.","

"Nephilim-6","1 August 2003","While Nausicaa is better this movie is a vast monument in animation. Therefor I find it an insult when people say something like Ice Age is better. sure Ice Age has pretty visuals but it does not have the depth and spirituality of Spirited Away.However I cannot really blame most comments since most people don't really know Japanese culture other than Sushi, hightech gadgets,  Dragonball Z and Pokemon.The thing with Spirited Away is that it delves deep into the spiritual side of Japanese culture. To Japanese people all things contain spirits. Hence all the gods and spirits in this movie. there's a lot of symbolism in this movie as well. And a lot of life lessons.And what I find really important: it doesn't try to be a kiddy movie but more a family movie. Western people often seem to view animation as something only for kids. In Japan this is simply not true. Animation is for everyone. It provides an escape and a way to create outragious stories that would not have been able to be created through normal film.i love it. I found it hard at first but after seeing it again all the puzzle pieces fell into place.Still I do have some isues with the film. Actually only 1. the ending was too swift. It should have been worked out a little bit more.
Other than that wonderful wonderful movie. oh and btw (comment to one reviewer) watch the original japanese language version with subtitles. Chihiro does NOT have a high pitched voice. The whole ide of Dubbing in itself I find ludicrous.","

"pifas","29 January 2004","There's no doubt that Pixar Animation Studio is the greatest thing on animation in modern times. I use to love any effort by them, being Monsters, Inc. my all-time favorite so far. However, yesterday I rented this movie 'cause I've been hearing some great things about it, and after watching it, I just have to say that Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi it is not just a great movie, this adjective is almost insulting: it's awesome, it is spectacular, it is mind and sight challenging, and is a round film from wherever point you wanna see it. Said in a few words, it's a masterpiece of modern times, which spends most of his time in a parallel (and surreal) world of ancient Japan. Sen to Chihiro... has so many powerful stuff to stand out for. It has one of the strongest imagination I've seen in my entire life on animation, and also there's a lot of inventiveness, believable profiles on characters (and they're animated!), perfect on detail drawing (yes, hand made, traditional drawing), pulse accelerating action, humor, an outstanding and subtle soundtrack, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Even the closing song is not less than beautiful.As much as I love and respect Pixar, this one blew me away enough to place it on the same level as the films made by the most popular animation studio. I just couldn't believe my eyes as I was watching it. Is that simple. This experience is magical, involving, marvelous, and one more great thing about it is that you don't have to be a manga fan manga to truly enjoy the trip; just have to be an animation lover. Well done animation. And that doesn't happen much; it did to me with The iron giant, but that was some time ago.
Mr. Miyazaki, I knew nothing about you or your work before Chihiro, but, from this point on, you have become my hero and I can't wait to have on my DVD player any other piece of animated heaven you've created.","

"seventhnaga","10 September 2005","Leave any preconceptions about this being a kids film at home, this is breathtaking. A simple enough story, told with such charm and imagination that it is hard not to love. In every moment there are elements that western cinema might spin into a whole film, but here they are just passing ideas. Every location is so full of life and spirit (pun intended) that a totally immersive atmosphere envelops the viewer at every stage. The film is gentle, yet does not shy away from death and emotion. It's not over-sentimental in it's approach either, just perfectly balanced. It made me genuinely laugh out loud, and cry too - a film hasn't provoked this reaction in me for five years.I have never seen such a brilliant animation, it surpasses the Bellvue Rendezvous and any other you care to think of. It's not just amongst animations that this film should be compared, it's amongst all films, of every genre, for the young or old. Standing tall among giants, this is truly great cinema.","

"Movie-ManDan","6 February 2021","Hayao Miyazaki is one of the most celebrated movie-makers ever. Doesn't matter that he does animated films; most of his films are better than most the acclaimed live-action films out there.Miyazaki is an artist. Film is a form of art. And when the boundaries of the cinematic medium are pushed to new limits and innovations are made, respect towards that maker is rightfully earned. Disney directors admired him like crazy. This Japanese creator pushes the boundaries with every film he makes, with one being simply better than his others.The best way to describe Miyazaki's magnum-opus is a clean mixture between ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Alice In Wonderland,"" the former of which is one of the most innovative and beloved films in its own right. While I definitely prefer old films, me preferring Miyazaki's work to the 1939 and 1959 films is something that is a surprise, but nothing I had to think twice about.""Spirited Away"" starts out with young Chihiro who moves with her parents to the a new town. She is unhappy about moving to a new house and having to make new friends at a new school. Don't we all. When they stumble upon an abandoned building in an abandoned theme park, Chihiro is scared. She wanders around in fear and gets back a few seconds later to her parents who have been turned into pigs. This abandoned park and building come to life. She meets teenage Haku who will be her guide in the new, unfamiliar world. The rest of the film takes place in this strange land.Chihiro must find a job at the bathhouse with Haku giving further instructions to escape this dreamland and restore things to normal. We are introduced to many, many, interesting-looking characters and creatures. It is amazing the way the creator of this film illustrates an abundance of such odd but amazing ""things."" Plus there's the background illustrations with impeccable detail. Apparently Miyazaki did most of the film hand-drawn. Considering how lifelike the settings are, it goes to show just how good he is as an artist.While the movie does look amazing in its illustrations, sound good in its music and effects, and the story never stops unfolding in such exciting ways, the flick is richly layered with great substance. If the movie was just pretty images, it would not have reached immortality. ""Spirited Away"" is a coming-of-age film that happens to be set in another world. Chihiro is 10-years-old and immature. In her journey, she applies for work, negotiates with scary individuals, overcomes fears. Overcoming fears is another big thing that this movie has to offer.So this may be a coming-of-age film, but this story leads to Chihiro becoming a better person. At the beginning, she's spoiled and scared. At the end, she is selfless and courageous. It is through her encounters with these these vastly different creatures that she learns to better herself. Greatly nuanced, this smooth transition in Chihiro's personality takes no short cuts in a magnificent life. Chihiro might be young, but we are deeply invested with her long before her and her parents cross the threshold.With dazzling visuals that won't quit and a meaningful story that keeps going, it is no wonder this Oscar-winning triumph is the most beloved anime film of all time.4/4","

"Alan-40","27 December 2005","There are numerous and inevitable comparisons of Spirited Away and Alice in Wonderland but I think they all miss the mark. The vision that Hayho Miyazaki conjures up is so unique and quirky that many critics seem to reach for a comparison just to attempt to get their minds around what they have just seen. My view is such comparisons do disservice to both works.Chihiro is something of a tiresome brat at the beginning of the story, an easy place to start that everyone can recognize. (Already we have diverged from the story of Alice) It seems that only her diminutive size renders her appealing. She needs rescuing, but not from the forced relocation she deplores as you might think, but from her own ennui and, possibly, the unintentional neglect of her own parents. This is a situation that most children can recognize or relate to, even ones who were children decades ago as well as those too young to recognize what is going on.This is where much of the true art comes in, and what makes so worth watching. Chihiro becomes more real in each frame. Her story of growth is pieced together meticulously but with nearly unbreakable mortar. She starts out passive and rightfully afraid of nearly everything that is happening to her, but with believable resilience, some luck, and some help from odd strangers she graduates from simply enduring to actively engaging her challenges in a way that is truly inspiring.One of the most important aspects to the story is that once Chihiro is in the spirit world, she is treated like an adult. She may not be cherished at first (actually actively despised due to no fault of her own), but she wins the chance to sign an employment contract, an act not common to 10 year olds. Once she does, she has made her own place and is accepted. She still must deal with derision from most of the creatures who populate the world (""not for a human"") and the unwelcome regard of her employer (sorceress Yu-Babba) but at least she finds a low rung on the social ladder. She must give up even her own name and take the name Sen, becoming someone else that must win Chihiro back, as well as the restoration of her parents.A key insight of the artwork lies in the fact that Kamajii, the spider-like boiler room attendant, Yu-Baaba and Zeniiba the twin sorceresses with way over-sized heads, and Bou, Yu-Baaba's gigantic baby, appear the way they do not because that is the the way an adult would see them, but the way a 10 year old girl might. Miyazaki-san has managed to reach back in his mind to see this, helped with his observations of a daughter of a friend who was about that age. An overbearing old woman's face would dominate the field of view of a girl as small as Chihiro, and the busy workman's arms would seem numerous and far reaching.One thread that I would have like to see played out more is the story of Lin, the hardworking and seemingly human girl who takes risks on Chihiro's behalf before she secures a contract, and then is delighted to take her as an apprentice, although she publicly hides it. (""Don't dump her on me!""). She is kind to Chihiro when she doesn't have to be, and looks after her. Rin has her own story that hasn't been told, in a respite moment she tells Chihiro that she wants to leave the bath-house where they work. Following Rin's lead most of the rest of the bath-house workers, who once despised all humans, are cheering for her to succeed. But Rin and Chihiro don't even get to say goodbye.Much has and will be written about the fantastic paintings come to life, and the incredible attention to detail that makes the movie more lifelike in many ways than a conventional reel would be. This is probably better experienced than discussed, but there is no flaw or fault in any frame that you can find. I am completely floored by critiques of this film that have anything bad to say about the animation  don't listen to them. You will only be cheating yourself; it does not get any better than this.Update: I got around to watching this again with the Japanese soundtrack, and as others have mentioned there are some fairly significant deviations between the Japanese and English versions of dialog. Further, the English subtitles to the Japanese track are not always perfect translations -- mostly pretty good. (When Chihiro says ""Hai!"" it can mean, ""Yes,"" ""Yes 'm,"" or ""right."") Unlike some other reviewers I think the English version is in many ways superior. In many cases dialog is not dependent on lip-sync, and the American writers took advantage of this to interject some things that would otherwise be unclear. I would recommend everyone watch both versions.","

"lewiskendell","18 July 2010","""Now go, and don't look back.""Some movies diminish with time and repeated viewings. When you find one that doesn't, you know you have a true classic on your hands. That's exactly what Spirited Away is.The animation and art are as impressive as any other animated movie that I've seen - including stop-motion movies, computer animation, and other traditional animation. The character designs are so imaginative that it makes me thoroughly jealous that I don't have the talent that these talented artists do. Every background and frame of animation is beautiful, and that's no exaggeration.     The story is simple, engaging, and charming. There no grand story arc, just a spoiled girl who matures a bit as she seeks a way back to her world for herself and her parents, and the trials that Chihiro and the various denizens she meets at the spirit bathhouse face. There are light morals about pollution, discrimination, and greed, but they're never presented in a way that's heavy-handed or blatant.All that praise, and I haven't even mentioned the score (one of the best in any animated movie that I've heard) and the voice work (very good in both English and Japanese) Spirited Away was a labor of love, and it shows. It's a masterpiece for Studio Ghibli, and a movie that anyone with heart can love, be they young or old.","

"elicopperman","4 February 2018","Like many people, I adore the work of Hayao Miyazaki, let alone Studio Ghibli. Not only are the worlds he creates through animation highly imaginative and gorgeous, but his characters and stories really make one think, especially with such themes like finding yourself, dangers towards the environment, survival, courage, over consumption, etc. So with that said, I not only deem his 2001 feature Spirited Away his best work, but also one of my personal favorite films of all time (and no Academy Award will ever be the reason why).The story is that after getting lost on the drive to their new home, a couple and their 10 year old girl named Chihiro enter a tunnel passage that leads them into some spirit world. After eating a bunch of the spirit's food, the parents are transformed into pigs by the witch Yubaba, the head of a bathhouse that many of the spirits work at. In order to save herself and her family, Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse in order to get back to the human world, while also building up her courage and rediscovering memories she lost long ago. I think this is the perfect set up for a great fantasy film, and the film does not fail in its execution. While the film focuses more on the plot, there are just enough fantasy moments to keep one's interest. Whether they be dark like the parents turning into pigs or Yubaba taking center stage, disgusting like the famous bath scene or the spirit No-Face hurling excruciatingly, or amusing like Chihiro working in the bathhouse, the film never holds back in letting its imagination run wild.That being said, what really makes this film for me are the characters themselves. Chihiro could have easily been annoying, but the film managed to balance her anxious fear and emotions to where you relate to her in situations like....well, having to save your parents and overcome your biggest fears. The spirit Haku, while sometimes thieving, only does so to find his way home and remember who he is, considering how much he despises working under Yubaba's wing. Speaking of Yubaba, while she can be very threatening and rather bossy, she also tries her darnedest to keep her workforce stable, so one can relate to such pandemonium (even if one could resent her). As for the other cast, No-Face is essentially a spirit who wants to get into the hearts of others, but simply doesn't know how. This is what causes him to go somewhat insane in the bathhouse and start consuming everything uncontrollably; good thing Chihiro came along to snap him out of reality. Sometimes, we can fly off the handle and only those who care for us can really make us feel better. In terms of supporting players, Lin can be saucy but does have a big heart and also has dreams of her own, Kamaji has a bit of a temper but also cares much for the support of Chihiro, Yubaba's baby goes from being a whiner to a kind soul through a spell that turns him into a mouse in order to teach him some manners, and the other spirits can range from weird to rather rude. Spirits sure are prejudice to humans, aren't they?Given that this is a Studio Ghibli flick, it's no surprise that the animation is splendid beyond reason. The designs of the spirits are highly imaginative and strange, Chihiro's movements look very much like that of a little girl, the backgrounds are breathtaking, the effects are lavish, the CGI blends very well with the 2D environments, and the world building really makes one wish the film showed more. Each scene (whether comedic, dramatic or frightening) are all played up with just the right amount of tension to detail. I think the train scene with Chihiro, No-Face and the baby is one of the greatest scenes in all of cinema if only for how quiet and atmospheric it is, just letting the scenery do the talking for the audience rather than dialogue. Lastly, the music score by Joe Hisaishi is a melodious treat. Like the animation, each track fits perfectly with whichever scene comes afloat, especially the train scene where it's more somber and mellow. The flying scenes have a lot of emotional appeal from the highly enchanting score that define just how gorgeous they look. Not to mention, the ending song might be stuck in your head for quite some time as it's heartwarming and symphonic enough to hit the right emotional spot for viewers.To quote Rotten Tomatoes, Spirited Away is a ""gorgeously drawn fairy tale that will leave viewers a little more curious and fascinated by our world"". There's a reason this film still remains one of the greatest accomplishments in all of animation, let alone film. Not only does it embrace the world of fantasy to such an emotional and thought provoking degree, but it makes one think how they themselves would overcome moments of losing loved ones, or having to work to save themselves, or remembering who they are. Of all the wonderful features that Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli have cranked out, none of them will ever leave the same impact on me as this masterpiece did. If you are yet to see this film, track it down as soon as you can. You yourself might be inspired by your own personal struggles that would fit in the world of fantasy, just like what Miyazaki did with this gem.","

"kellielulu","5 June 2023","I did not fully embrace this film as many have but I did find a poigancy in Chihiro's adventure. She and her family are moving to the suburbs and have a new home and Chirhiro will attend a new school something she doesn't look forward too. They make a stop and sudenlty everything is diffent and Chihio experecinces fantastical things and summon all her curouge and intelligence and compassion to the less fourunate to get back to her parents. I't s a long and complicated journey but she makes it and is left wisful about her adveture which she can't share with her parents. It was a little sad but hopeful. She learned about others and how her problems seem minor in comparion. She is able to help some along the way and they help her. Once she reuites with her parents she realizes it's only been seconds for them and it's nothing she can tell them about but as she tells them she is ready for their new life it seems managable now. The lessons learned are basic life lessons told in a very elaborate way.","

"PCC0921","30 December 2021","For me, anime is an experience that always took me to a place far away from where I am now. To a place on the other side of the planet. To a place totally different to what I am used to back here in the states. Getting the ability to see the underlying culture of the land of the rising sun, is what makes Japanese animation so enjoyably different, interesting and insightful.And, that is what Hayao Miyazaki has always been able to do well, was to tap into those wonderful aspects of anime and the fact that they do highlight the cultural connection to the honorable nation of Japan. But, Miyazaki is able to take it one step further, by attracting a world audience and making his films enjoyable. He also made them about everyone, for everyone and not just Japan. He makes you feel at home in a place totally foreign to you.It is the surface visuals and the story that his creations take you to those places that explore mystical, magical or other-worldly ideas. The animation aspect and the drawings are the extra sugar on top. The beautiful choice of colors, which have a Monet feeling to them, set a great backdrop to Miyazaki's classic animation style.The man, who gave us the legendary Lupin III, back in the 70s and 80s, brings another one of his amazing creations to the screen. His career after Lupin and Castle of Cagliostro (1979), took him to another level of motion picture achievement. The technology changed and he grew with it. The rough edges seen in the early decades of anime was becoming smoother, more clean and colorful. Like the evolution of film, anime has become an art from as well and Hayao Miyazaki influenced its growth immensely.He also has a very interesting imagination. Case in point; this film. Some of the images, situations and characters are really out of this world. He comes up with things I could never even think of. Each turn of the film seemed like a surprise or even slightly shocking. It is a world and a setting much like Alice in Wonderland. It revolves around a young girl, who gets caught alone, on an island (that appeared out of nowhere), after her parents were turned into pigs? Sen, our young heroine's, first thought is..... I need a job.I don't want to give away too much of the plot. Sen's situation is a complicated one, which requires the audience to take it all in. She also has to deal with being discriminated against by the other beings she encounters. They really don't like humans in the Spirited Away world. She also finds comfort with a dragon who can transform into her more human-looking friend Haku. This all eventually comes back to how she needs to save her parents, by breaking their pig-curse and get back to her world. Time is running out.Sen does ignore and accept a lot of the things that she encounters or experiences rather easily, compared to what a normal girl might. She doesn't seem surprised by anything too much. Maybe that is her naïve, young age, that helps her along the way? I'm not sure. But, she is accepting of her situation pretty quick. I'm not sure if that was a good move on Miyazaki's part, unless he just wanted to get the particulars out of the way quickly, so he could move on with the meatier parts of the story. Either way, you forget about that blemish quickly, because the images and situations that Sen gets into, takes you along the way.The impact that Spirited Away (2001), had on the animation world was big. John Lasseter, the legendary Pixar creator, who gave us Toy Story (1995), picked up the USA rights for Disney, dubbed the film into English and helped carry the film to win Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards in 2003.8.1 (B Mygrade) = 8 IMDB.","

"emasterslake","15 March 2005","Spirited Away is an excellent anime film. I didn't see the film till I learned about Miyazaki and the films he did. After I rented the movie, I was blown away. The animation, storyline, characters, and voice talents are perfect. I would consider it one of the best anime films I've ever seen.It's something to watch and enjoy again and again. What's special about it is Miyazaki made it for a 10 year old girl he knew. This movie is also made for people about to become 10 or people who use to be 10, because the main character is 10 years old and goes on this magical adventure.It's taken place in Modern Day Japan, it focuses on a little girl named Chihiro who's moving to a new town. She's not very comfident or happy about moving. Most kids would feel that way when they miss their old home. Her family is driving to their new home, only her dad couldn't find the right road that leads to their new home. They ended up going through a path that leads to an old building, on the other side of it is an Abandon theme park, or at least that's what Chihiro's Dad thinks. I recommend renting, buying orborrow this movie. If you like Miyazaki's other films, then you gotta see this one. You won't be disappointed, I guaranty it.My Rating: 9.5/10","

"jacksflicks","23 September 2002","Every external review I've read so far reads like and infomercial.  Well, so does this one.  It's amazing!Do you want to be just as dazzled as the kids in the audience?Do you want to share the experience - to commune with hundreds around you - like why you GO OUT to a movie in the first place?Do you want to access a foreign aesthetic in a congenial, vivid way, that you've never experienced before?Do you want to see state-of-the-animation art and sound and story AND English dubbing combined in one film?Do you want to see an animated feature that won the Berlin Film Festival against all other comers, including live action?Do you want to see not just moving pictures, but moving PAINTINGS?Then see this film!  I was lucky enough to see it in a packed house at the Disney restored and operated El Capitan movie palace in Hollywood.  I have the feeling, that wherever Spirited Away is exhibited, Disney, who is the distributor, will only allow it to be shown on the best screens in town.  Anyway, don't wait for the video.  See it in the theater, then get the DVD when it's released.Now, does this sound like an infomercial?  You bet.  But the difference here is, that it's not hype.  It's all true.  The plot has been outlined elsewhere, so I won't repeat it.  Just a few things that appeal to me personally:Despite the Western trappings of a suburban family moving to a new house and the theme park setting, the central location of a bathhouse reminds me that this is a Japanese film, with Japanese sensibilities and Japanese aesthetic. I feel like I'm watching a synthesis of Zen and Shinto and Noh and maybe even a little Sumo (you'll recognize that reference when you see it). 
Many of the Japanese mythical allusions which many of the characters are making are lost on me, but the wonderful artistry of the depictions makes their obscurity that much more charming.  I really like ""No Face,"" especially in the beginning:  a real spook, and because of the dramatic mask it wears, one I'd imagine is a stock character which Japanese children are familiar with.The dragon, at once fierce, because I'm a Westerner, and sympathetic, because of its plight:  there is an amazing scene where it is being devoured, in flight, by birds - ORIGAMI birds!The inside of the bathhouse:  It's the most exciting, delicious, nightmarish thing I've seen since I was a little kid watching that house of naughty boys in Pinocchio's dream.This flick has pushed my buttons - the right buttons - so I could go on and on.  So I'd better stop.Pleeeeeze see Spirited Away.  NOW!","

I just LOVE this movie!! Whoever hasn't seen it really should; nobody I know hasn't liked it. I just couldn't believe the animation...unbelievable, that's why! Some of it looks real!

It looked interesting from the commercials I saw, although I didn't really have any clue what it was about - Yubaba's giant head was scary. I picked up the limited edition DVD box, which is beautifully designed and includes an awesome special feature DVD. I watched the movie with English dubbing, which I'm always wary of, but it was superbly done this time. On the surface, this looks like a children's story, but in execution it's for everyone. Spirited Away was one of the most enchanting experiences I've ever had, Miyazaki produced one unbelievable masterpiece, deep in Japanese culture. It was a rollercoaster of emotions, and I never looked away from the TV screen. Everything, EVERYTHING was so perfect. The animation was beautiful, the music was beautiful, the story was beautiful, this was PERFECTION. If there is one DVD you get this year, make it this! It's an unforgettable experience, and is one of the greatest things I've ever seen.

"FogelNo1","17 October 2002","I, like most people, came to know Miyazaki's films by Princess Mononoke. When I heard of this film's release, I was beyond excited. I didn't expect it to beat Mononoke, but I expected it to be really good. I was mistaken. It is better than Mononoke. It isn't really good, it's an animation masterpiece. I was in tears, not because the movie was moving, or happy, but because I had never had such fun in a movie theater.Spirited Away is brilliant and vibrant, filled with the characters that nightmares and dreams are formed from. The animation is eye-popping to say the least...not just in color, sophistication or texture, but in MOVEMENT. The film flows like water, not like the stiff stone-like characters seen in most anime films, such as Ghost in the Shell or Jin-Roh. The film itself is so magnificently well-played...nobody in the film is really evil, but every step of the way is exciting.As for the dubbing, it was excellent...while ALL other anime films looked so silly in their dubbed forms, I think this film is nearly perfect...there were maybe one or two moments in the film when I was reminded that I was watching it in a different language than its original form.As a lover of fine cinema, animation plays a small, but vital, role in my passion. Spirited Away is amongst the best films in the medium...Miyazaki has proven himself to be a film-maker of diverse talent, and has launched himself into the first decade of a new millenium with a movie that is nothing less than timeless.","

"EdwardtheBlackPrince","8 April 2021","Studio Ghibli's 11th Film Spirited away tells the story of a 10-year-old girl named Chihiro who's moving to a new town. Her father takes a wrong turn and they end up at a tunnel of which leads them to a small rural town. Her parents sit down eat food Chihiro explores and finds a Bathhouse when she returns she finds out that her parents have been turned into pig and that she's actually in a world of spirits with the aid of a boy name Haku she gets a job working in the bathhouse under a witch named yubaba. Now going by the name of Sen she must now find a way just save her parents and find a way home. To say this is the studios crown and achievement is not an understatement. While the studios been popular in Japan with many films being financial hits, they were still more of obscure to Western audiences. This is the film that brought the studio to the main demographic of the west demographic and One of the first animated films ever to win an Academy award. This is a breathtaking piece of animation from it setting, its characters, story and it's music. Chihiro herself is one of the best written kids in animation she's pure and innocent,timid and scared but also determination shows in the evolution of her character. She's just a scared little girl at first, thinks moving to a new home is the worst of her problems. She's sad, she cries she's a kid that you want to see succeed and get home. She has to learn to adapt to this environment having to work in this bath house with all the spirits who outright have a bias towards her. Factor in the fact that knowing that if she screws up that she will end up joining her parents and will obviously be eaten. She grows tremendously. The film also has it supporting cast various spirits who are you to hear along the way Haku is Yubaba Slave who gets Chihiro the job in the bathhouse. You don't necessarily know why he wants to help though you can tell his tensions are pure,and that he wants to see her safe. Yubaba is a Perfect depiction of a witch she's old wrinkly and ugly with an over exaggerated nose and a huge boil in the middle of her forehead. She acts like a Cron to everybody else but she has a baby that she just pampers and spoils and it all motherly. Her design is so great it would be used in a similar way in howl's moving Castle. Kamaji& Rin also leave a lasting impact that you remember them. But the one other character everybody remembers most from this movie is no-face a greed spirit. He wears a strange mask with a fixed smile on it doesn't speak. You don't really know what to make of him at first but he has a reason for his actions. The animation is beautiful shots of the countryside are green running through the flower fields. The ocean is sparkling blue. The bathhouse one of the best interior architecture's from the studio. The interior to the exterior majority of the movie take place here you have long shots that show off the size and scope of it traditional eco period Architecture. All the detail put in to just one scene such as Yubaba is a commitment to craftsmanship. It feels immersive specially with all the various different design spirits littering The place. Joe Hisaishi delivers one of the most diverse soundtracks ever the music goes from fast pace to slow and somber bombastic emotionally do you put heartwarming pieces. Spirited away remains one of the greatest animated films of all time and a classic that is always with me.","

"vasco_cid","10 March 2003","It's not something new that chinese and japanese animation has always inspire, dazzle and marvel all of us, westerns. Despite quality (in some cases good; in others, bad) the sets, the characters, the animation and the colors always made us want to plunge inside the screen to follow the adventures in their quest; most noticebly, in my personal opinion, the Tv Series ""Evangelion"". When the trailor to the voyage of Chiriro hit the theatres, not a single skeptical and even so called hateful eye, could manage to blame any of its excentricities and its obvious scientific impossibilities. but has we have seen in many other movies before, either animated or not, many of them are not attempting at plausibility, they're rather a metaphor. What this movie r is all about is love, and how we can step out of our fearful world to try to catch our beliefs, save the ones we love. In that area, the movie plainly fulfills its mission: it has emotion everywhere, being that same emotion supported by a dazzling animation. Mutch to my desmay, I truly wanted to like Chihiro, but it became somewhat of a bore: like many other movies it could have been told in half the running time, some scenes were totally expendable, and somewhere around the middle of the movie, it becomes a total compliment to gore and dirtyness. Sincerelly, over two hours of dazzling animation aren't enough to make a movie all that great. In the bottom line, as for me, the movie only was average worthy in the instrumental main theme; Chiriro 'flying' from room to room towards Yobaba and Chihiro's fabulous view from her room. It's eye candy, in fact, but it doesn't make us plunge. That's its main and fatal sin.","

I told a lady I've watched the subbed version and was about to check the dubbed one. Then she said; ""you mean the dumb version??"" We all had a good laugh Well, having said that, the dubbed version clearly add/modify some line to suit the US audience better, particulary in the comedy aspect (you'll find the dubbed version funnier than the subbed) However, it CHANGES some important points in the storyline SPOILER one obvious example is: in the dubbed version it's mentioned that Haku is a river spirit in the ending dialogue with Sen..what the?!??!?!??!?! That almost spoil the entire flashback scene meaning. Oh well, I won't start pinpointing what's the meaning of all this....hope they do better next time.Get the dub/sub DVD and decide for yourselves","

"d4v3cs","7 October 2002","this movie scares me to bits... Damn, it reminds me of my childhood nightmares and dark imagination everytime I went to an amusement park, that after the sun sets, the place would turn into a dark dimension with horrible and hideous creatures. Also a certain tunnel that leads to another horrible places full with disfigured creatures, ghouls and goblins. This movie brought it EXACTLY like how it was in back then. Geez... now I can't even eat much anymore...buekkhhhhapart from that...uh. I can't give any praise. Instead I'll just say what I feel, this is the most mixed emotion movie I ever watched...also the most weird. It seems like the movie ""babe"" went wrong at first. As the movie progress, I started to see the true innovative art behind it. This is the first movie ever where I'm unable whatsoever to guess what happens next. I watched it straight after mononoke, I can't help but to wonder why there's always blobish/tentacles thing in his movies.
Now the strange thing is how I relate so much to the mask man and Migihayami Kohakunushi, barely unexplainable.At last, as always, it's the soundtrack, the spirit companion of a movie, the single tool that let its images linger in your mind and memory.","

Even on my n-th rewatch (though it has been awhile) this was just as magical, if not more, than the first time. How does Miyazaki come up with this stuff? It at once feels dreamlike without being silly, grounded without being stuffy. It's a masterpiece of a fairy tale.","

"neilperera20","10 July 2003","This film reminds us that great animation is not about excessive CGI and overblown special effects, but is about sheer imagination and creativity.  I love how japanese animation makes serious issues about life accessible to children to understand, yet have a deeper level which adults can also appreciate through the symbolism and rich imagery.   Being enthralling for children and deep for adults makes this film exceptional.  Only negative would be the length which left some of the youngsters abit restless but the imagery really is  wonderful and will intruige even the the most cynical audience.  
In short escapism at its best....up there with the anime classics like grave of the fireflies!!9/10","

"Mr Toad","19 April 2003","*May be some spoilers ahead*This was supposed to be the anime I could appreciate. Yet, once the DVD's turned off, it is still... just anime.You've heard it before, and you'll hear it again: Why does all anime look the same? As lush and imaginative as the world of Spirited Away is, Chihiro et al still look like they could have come from any other Japanese animated movie. I'm starting to think it is a good thing Disney has the American market monopolized. At least Disney strives for variety from year to year. You may not like the consistently happy endings, or the ultra-family-friendly nature of the films, but visually, at least, the Mouse innovates. Compare the differences between Beauty and the Beast and Lilo and Stitch with those between... well, any two anime titles. Notice something? The difference between ""good anime"" and ""bad anime"" does not constitute stylistic variety.Yes there are positive themes in the movie. Chihiro grows up. It's great that she learns a lot of good things: respect, discipline, true friendship, etc. But the character development is spotty at best. Whereas we get a good understanding of Chihiro, we learn very little about Haku, the boy she learns to love (in a semi-platonic way).Two more gripes: Why do the main characters have to explain the plot as it unfolds via monologue? e.g. ""He flew into that window up there. Maybe I can climb up and help him."" (when no one else is present) And, even in a fantasy setting, shouldn't the characters struggle a little before accepting some things? e.g. ""Oh he's a dragon."" and ""Call me Granny."" ""O.K., Granny.""Again, it's not a terrible movie. But it is still anime, little mouths, little noses, cute fuzzies and all. I give it a 6/10.--------------------------Edit: I'd say it's grown on me by about an extra star over the years, but still isn't one I'd recommend to someone who wanted to watch anime. Even for Miyazaki, you're better off watching Howl's Moving Castle or some number of his older stuff.","

"ebiros2","17 October 2005","I kind of understand the world this movie is trying to express. The world and the characters that appears in this movie are caricature of archetype Japanese personalities. But it's in the area of what I would call emotional human waste dump. I think Japanese also has healthier world views in them asides from the one expressed in this movie. The loneliness, sadness, cruelty expressed in this movie is what kids in the feudal era of Japan would have experienced when they were sent away to serve at a large merchant's house at a very young age. If your family was too poor to support you, that was your only option. This is a fictional modern day version of many stories like this a child might have experienced even as recently as 60 years ago in Japan.To me, the movie basically had no message. I'm surprised that it was embraced so well by the audiences here. I'm pretty sure western audience are not aware of the psychological connotation of this movie which only have meaning to the Japanese. Hayao Miyazaki has been at producing anime movies for 30 years, and he's been digging a lot into the dark side of Japanese psyche for the past 5 years. It might help to remember things that are almost being forgotten today, but for me I'm not sure if remembering these things are even healthy to begin with. Wouldn't it be nice if a child discovers how to grow up in the world as citizen of earth instead of remembering the saddest memory of the past ?","

"johnnysugar","25 September 2002","I've been a fan of anime for years.  Unlike many anime watchers, my first exposure wasn't to ""Akira"" or ""Macross.""  It was to a movie called ""Warriors of the Wind"", which I learned years later was actually a hack-job version of the poetic ""Nausicaa in the Valley of the Wind"" by Hayao Miyazaki, a man compared often to Akira Kurosawa, and who many call the most gifted anime director of all time.Miyazaki's film ""Princess Mononoke"", which was imported to the US and released by Disney in an English dub, was an ecological fantasy where humans and ancient gods dueled for the fate of nature.  It was a dark and dramatic epic of culture and tradition.  In comparison, Miyazaki's latest release, ""Spirited Away"", is unadulterated joy and innocence, a two-and-a-half hour fable of courage and perseverance.Young Chihiro is moving to the country with her parents.  On the way to their new home, her parents come upon a seemingly abandoned theme park and, despite the protests of their daughter, begin to gorge themselves on food they find.  When night falls, the theme park transforms into a land of shades and phantoms, and Chihiro's parents have been transformed into pigs. Chihiro receives aid from a strange young man named Haku, who tells her that to stay in the spirit world and rescue her family, she must get a job from the witch Yubaba, who cannot refuse her request.  During her stay in this strange world, Chihiro undergoes many trials that put her courage and her love for others to the test.The movie itself plays like ""Alice in Wonderland"" filtered through Japanese folklore.  I admit, I didn't understand many of the concepts of the movie because of its reliance on such things, and while at first the movie seems not to have a coherent plot, keep in mind that anime in general has never fully subscribed to the linear plots of American cinema.
The colors and designs of the movie are fantastic, and there is no shortage of unusual beings.  Tiny soot monsters who work for an eight-armed man, a bulbous Radish Spirit, and a majestic river dragon are a few of the inhabitants.  The most poignant of the movie's characters may be No-Face, a lonely spirit that consumes all he can.  The tone of the movie is generally light, with moments of drama and darkness when appropriate, but always filled with a resonant innocence and wonder.The voice acting, while not as star-studded as that of ""Mononoke"", is quite good, with seasoned actors like Suzanne Pleshette (Yubaba) and the ever-popular and multi-talented Tara Strong providing solid dub skills. Daveigh Chase, wonderful as Lilo in Disney's ""Lilo and Stitch"", is Chihiro, and while some of her readings sound a bit shrill, she is a very believable and realistic voice for the plucky heroine.When all is said and done, the movie may lack the drama and desperation of many anime, but instead of offering this, the movie is content to transport you to another world filled with joy and mystery.  Few movies display as much pleasure as this one in displaying moments of awe and laughter. Never mind that the animation itself is beautiful and intricate as only a master could create.  If you are lucky enough to be in a city where this movie is showing, by all means, see it as soon as possible.10 out of 10.","

"anti_heroi","3 April 2020","Spirited Away is, of course, a big experience to evertyone who wants to know the process between chidhood and adulthood/amadureciment. The film express this theme thought Chihiro, the main agent of this process, who doesnt have the perspective of the adult age, like a psychology book about chilhood, but the movie shows the consequences of this transition thought the own children.
Chihiro is showed in the beginning like a spoiled girl that all time is complaining about everything and everybody. She complain about the fact her are going to other city and about the fact her flower are dying (this is her responsability). In this first half of movie, Chihiro is, basically, a girl who have fight with whole the world about little things. With the happening of the story, when this parents are transformate in pigs and the region of restaurants started to be invades by ghost and sobrenatural criatures, the world had the effort to challenge Chihiro to get out of this situation, and this is one of the mensages of the movie: The world is a place that is indiferent or againt you.
To survive, Chihiro need to work in this sobrenatural society, a society that have a big obssession for gold. In this little information, is possible to compare with the capitalist real world about work and greed, for example Yubaba, the society's leader who's appear in movie like a authoritarian person. Yubaba, who's represent the boss, the politic and all of people who's only see money, shows her insanity when she ""take"" Chihiro's name, removing some letters in kanji (japanese writing) e transforme it in ""Sen"". The name ""Chihiro"" is formated by ""thousand"" and ""search"" kanjis, representing the person who's is big, numerally, but ""Sen"", name imposted by Yubaba, is formated only by ""thousand"" kanji, transforming Chihiro in a number. However, the most interesting about Yubaba is, not necessary, she is retrated like a bad character even have some characteristics of ocidental animations villains, like Disney. In some moments, she helps the people in some hard works in the bathroom, like in the ""stink spirit""(Kawa no Kami)'s incident, when she motivate Chihiro/Sen to serve the customer. An antagonist building that isn't totally bad distance of cliches animation and transforme Yubaba in a more humanizate character.
When it's know all dificulties that fight in this journey, important to her ripening that isn't ""opost to chilhood"" in any moment, many elements appear in movie, main in the second half, represent the memorie and the nostalgia of chilhood not valorized by Chihiro in the benning. The hair tie gived by Zeniba (Yubaba's sister) and stitched by No-Face (Bandai-Gaeru) is one of this elements. This Tie, that according to Zeniba can protect Chihiro of all bad things, transforme the material object, liked to polit in the capitalist world, in a emotional object, when, in this topic, express the emotional value of the things and not only the finantial value is part of individual ripening.
Spirited Away is one of the best Hayao Miyazaki's movies. Chihiro is not a passive agent that only see the world happen in your life, that is the form to represent the childhood in many times, but a ative agent who can build new thing in the world and suffers the consequences of his actions because the child is part of the world too. Like say the song of the brazilin poet and composer Arnaldo Antunes: ""Everybody was child yet, Einstein, Freud and Plato too/Hitler, Bush and Saddam Hussei/Who have money and who doesn't have""","

"Musy345","12 January 2014","After years of hearing how incredible this film is I decided to give it a go. I should say that I don't usually watch anime but I do love animated features such as Lion King, Toy Story and Ratatouille. I could understand what the film was trying to do by letting the viewer experience a fairytale world come to life. The animation was also vibrant and quite incredible from an artistic and technical point of view. However, I could not help but feel let down by the lack of substance in the story telling. I did not get most of the characters and didn't like many of the characters other than the protagonist who was okay. Her parents, who are meant to be the reason she goes through this difficult journey, seem like snobs and as such the little girl's trials ultimately feel pointless. Although I should add that the last 15 minutes are very touching and make the film seem worthwhile watching. Definitely watch it to see if it's your cup of tea but as I much as I like animated films, I will not be returning to this one as I have to countless other Pixar/Disney films.","

"estreet-eva","5 December 2011","We caught the next in the continuing series of Hayao Miyazaki?s animated children?s movies playing at our town theater this weekend. ?Spirited Away? is considered his masterwork and features his classic themes including environmentalism, a plucky young girl, witches and other magical creatures and the consequences of an older generation?s greed. Unlike other of his films there is no backdrop of war in a fanciful land but rather a move to the suburbs by an ordinary family. Chihiro, who is renamed Sen by the evil witch Yubaba, must face the mostly hideous other-worldly creatures of what appears to the outside world as an abandoned amusement park in her quest to return her parents to their original species. She is befriended by the Miyazaki?s compulsory flawed but brilliant wizard, in this case called Haku. Unlike his other films, there is a non-magical (muggle?) female lead called Lin who also aids Chihiro. As usual the animation is amazing and is made frightening by surrealistically outsized facial features on the evil Yubaba and her ridiculously sized baby. Conversely, the six-armed boiler-tender called Kamajii is disturbing because of a fluidity of his movements which give the impression that we might be OK to go ahead an evolve a few more limbs. Most impressive is a train which travels through the lonely, flooded plains which surround the bathhouse and the other station stops. The train is peopled by ghostly passengers rendered as dark silhouettes who slowly depart until only Chihiro and her small party of creatures remain. This sequence is the most truly dream-like I?m seen on film. Chihiro eventually rescues her parents and reclaims her name by rejecting conventional reactions to seemingly evil characters and understanding what is causing them to behave the way they do. In one sequence she removes a literal gigantic tangle of junk from a river spirit which all the rest of the cast avoids due to his smell. In another, she rejects the gold gobbled up by the rest of the cast when offered by a character called ?No-Face.? After No-Face goes berserk and his gold turns out to be an illusion she lures him out of the bathhouse because she understands that the greed of the staff is causing him to tear the place apart. Finally, when Haku returns dying and in dragon form from Yubaba?s twin sister, Chihiro pulls out of him the golden seal he stole which is killing him. ?Spirited Away? received a 94 on Metacritic putting it 11th all time. It was also, apparently, the biggest money making in Japanese film history. I?m not sure I would rank it quite that high but it does an amazing job of relating its story of environmentalism, pacifism, and understanding through pictures that transcend the language barrier.","

"aeriz","3 June 2003","To design and think of all the characters in this film is sheerly masterfull.  Each spirit has a unique aspect reflecting what they are and how they are different from those around them.  Even the bath house workers, who are more or less one of two races of spirits, have qualities that make them individual from their peers.  This is one of Hayao's greatest creations and a must see even for non-anime lovers.","

"mattedesa","24 May 2004","I've never been a big fan of anime.Granted, I've only seen a handful of anime films, but they've never really interested me. So when a friend threw a copy of Spirited Away in my hands and said, ""You've gotta watch this!"" I was less than thrilled, but decided to give it a try.I'm glad I did.The little girl in the movie is made to seem very real. She has all the mannerisms and quirks of a normal, bratty little girl. She is suddenly cast into a surreal world of spirits in which she must be brave and take care of herself.The unique characters and fascinating artwork make this fun to watch. These aren't your stereotypical cutesy anime characters either. The film really branches out and has diverse characters that keep you guessing.If I can think of anything negative about this movie, it might have run on a few minutes too long, but that's a small point, and can easily be overlooked.So, I'm still not going to rush out and watch all the anime films I can, but for those of you who (like me) have decided that you don't care for anime, allow this to be the rare exception.9 of 10","

I watched this film dubbed in English, so it may have lost some of the magic that certain films only have in their original language, but that still couldn't take away from the actual story in front of me which, if I'm honest, I didn't think was great enough to deserve all these 5 stars. Once you get passed the sheer absurdness of the whole thing, the film is enjoyable and very funny, but that's about it, I wasn't left with any feeling of enlightenment, or that i'd just witnessed one of the greatest films ever made. It's a cute film but that's it really. I'd like to see it again, because I really do wonder whether I've missed something that all these reviewers seem to have seen, but I can't really recommend this film as one of the greatest I've ever seen, because it just isn't.

"nymeria-meliae","17 January 2016","Sometimes I really wished that you could reply to other reviewers rather than have to write a full review yourself. Being married to a Japanese person means that Miyazaki has God-like status in our household. I remember the first time I ever saw Princess Mononoke on TV in Japan and I was blown away by it... the detail in the animation was unbelievable and I just watched it and watched it again and again... I could not believe that anything would ever come close to beating that film as the greatest piece of animation ever created. I was wrong... Spirited Away blew it out of the water. The first thing I want to address though... if like my family, you buy every Miyazaki film ever released from Japan with all the extras then you will know that Spirited Away may have been animated using computers but every scene was hand drawn first. The second disc in the full DVD package includes the entire film with soundtrack but using the hand drawn pages for the animation. This film is NOT some computer generated excuse for animation like one Tom and Jerry fan suggested. This was all hand drawn and to suggest otherwise is an insult to the animation genius that is Miyazaki. SPOILER ALERT:Secondly, story line. The overall plot might have similarities to Alice in Wonderland but it is nowhere near a direct copy of the book. To suggest that it is an Alice in Wonderland rip off is like me suggesting you pulled that reference straight off of Wikipedia. So she goes through a tunnel into another world... big wow... Alice is not the only adventure that goes through a tunnel into another world. If we are going to draw very loose references to stories then it is a rip off of Homer's Odyssey when the crew get turned into pigs for eating forbidden food on the island. I don't remember Alice's parents ever entering Wonderland or the plot of the story centering about Alice trying to restore her family to humans. Alice is essentially about the play of language... and the only similarity other than entering a tunnel to Spirited Away is the power of names. The plot of Spirited Away is complex... there are several subplots surrounding a main plot. The main story is about Chihiro trying to rescue her parents while trying to survive in a hostile world full of prejudice. The main message of the film, however, is about the evils of greed. Each subplot in the film demonstrates the evil of greed. Just like Mononoke was about the environment. In Spirited Away there is an environmental message included as there is in almost all Miyazaki films - the river God being cleaned... but the main message is that greed leads to bad things happening. However, for me the most outstanding piece was the power of names. My only regret was that Miyazaki didn't take this further. END OF SPOILERSo overall, the film is quite possibly the greatest piece of animation ever created. It has a story and it has a message if you bother to look for them beyond the bedazzlement of the art work and soundtrack. With Mononoke I watched the film several times and then started getting bored with it as the magic waned... I have yet to get bored of Spirited Away and have watched it almost twice as much as Mononoke. It is scary for a child but no more so than a Disney film. My 4 year old will leave the room when Maleficent comes on screen in Sleeping Beauty, and she will cover her eyes when the evil Queen appears in Snow White. She covers her eyes at parts of Spirited Away too... but she watches the film to the end. It is definitely a film to be watched with adults though... it is not a film to put your child down and leave them with the TV as a babysitter... but who is to say that all animation is designed solely for children?","

This is about a little girl on a family trip ... well trip it will be. Especially for her and what she gets into. Very creative and very well done.

"kavalaviktor","18 August 2022","The plot was good however the most impressive part was the introduction of the characters and the setting. I felt so happy and on the edge at the same time due to the unknown atmosphere around. It also inspired me on some story driven game ideas as well so I highly recommend it.","

"La Gremlin","30 May 2003","Let's face facts: Anime is better than live action.  Animation is better in the same respect that dreams hold more *truth* than reality.  Understand this and (I know it's starting to sound like a broken record, but it's true) you are going to love ""Spirited Away"".Rabbit holes are everywhere, according to Miyazaki, and they are just waiting for you to fall inside.  You have every reason in the world to do so.  You can spare two hours to nurture the child within, can't you?","

"Tweekums","28 June 2008","This is probably Hayao Miyazaki's best film and given the very high quality of his other films that is saying a lot. As always with Studio Ghibli films the animation is absolutely beautiful and the story is enthralling.The story follows the adventures of ten year old Chihiro who finds her self trapped in a spirit world when her parents take a wrong turn on the way to a new house. They enter this world through a tunnel which they think leads to an abandoned theme park. Her parents help themselves to the food at a restaurant and while they eat Chihiro explores fearing they will get in trouble for eating the food. While exploring she meets Haku, a young boy, who tells her she must leave before it gets dark, unfortunately when she gets to where her parents were eating she finds two pigs and she can't return to the car as a river now blocks her way.As it is too late for her to leave and she wants to rescue her parents she has to stay. Haku tells her that humans are not allowed in the spirit world but if she can get a job there she will be allowed to stay. She manages to get a job in the bath house where she impresses the others when she deals with the stink god who isn't quite what he originally appears to be. She also lets the mysterious No-Face enter, at first he is welcome as he hands out gold to the workers but as he eats more and more they realise he isn't as benevolent as he seems. There are further adventures involving Haku, No-Face, Yubaba (a witch) and a giant baby amongst others.The film is full of strange and wonderful characters, some are friendly, some are creepy but none seem really malicious. This film is suitable for all but the youngest or most nervous of children, it ends with Chihiro earning freedom for herself and her parents not slaying some evil monster. If you enjoy traditional animation and have yet to see this then you really should give it a go, I'm sure people will be enjoying this for decades to come.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.","

"zeekwunlau","20 March 2020","In Spirited Away, the cute ten-year-old girl, Chihiro, strayed into the ghost world with her parents, whose parents turned into big pigs because of gluttony. In order to save the whole family, Chihiro had to work for the mother-in-law Tang who was in charge of the baths in the spirit realm, and at the same time gave up her name-which also meant giving up on herself. In fact, most of the people working in this bath are lost children, giving up self, only seeing money in their eyes, or the desire for life represented by money.The happy ending of the cartoon is not unexpected, and the relationship between Chihiro and Bailong is also reasonable. But I don't think it's a movie about emotions, not even Chihiro's extraordinary courage. What I see is a return from beginning to end, a return to innocence, a return to childlike innocence.I always feel that the bath has a special meaning in this story. The bath was originally a place where the dust was cleansed to purify the soul. The huge river god was moved by Chihiro 's innocence in the bath. He washed away the pollution before giving her the god of river; His true colors. And the reason why Chihiro can not be moved by desire from beginning to end is because she can maintain the precious innocence from beginning to end.Innocence is valuable because it is not stubborn, or persistent, changed by the external environment. The biggest difference between adults and children is not the soundness of the mind and the clarity of the mind, but the growing loss of possession and happiness. Because there is too much temptation in the adult world, adults often judge themselves based on what they see in others' eyes, whether they should be successful, and whether they should feel happy. In the child's innocent heart, the entire world is rewarding itself, laugh when you are happy, and cry when you are sad. Live simple, so happy. Chihiro's salvation and salvation all come from her innocence. Even if she is in desire, a childlike heart can always lead her out of her confusion. So this return to the self is not only because of the courage of Chihiro, but also because of her innocence from the heart.","

"andreiz2k","1 April 2004","I loved this movie. It allowed me to relive the wonder and edge-of-your-seat-excitement I experienced in my childhood when I watched another similar movie, The Neverending Story (Die Unendliche Geschichte). Watching Spirited Away awakened in my an almost insatiable appetite to see Neverending Story again. Although, unlike Miyazaki wondrous creation, it's German and older, although it's not animated and the special fx are a bit ""dated"", although it's about the coming of age of a little boy and not a little girl, the two movies are so much alike that when I watched it I had the feeling that Miyazaki's masterpiece is in fact the actualized Japanese version  of this movie... The escapist premise is essentially identical: 2 children find an exit door from the mundane, from the rollerink, one through a hallway in an crying citadel, the other through a book. Both have parents too absorbed by themselves and their problems who don't have enough time for their kids' problems. In both movies self-sacrifice is a condition for survival and return to the real world. And let us not forget the friendly flying dragon which appears in both movies and is in essence a spermatozoid with the head of a labrador golden retriever... ;^) Still, I have to admit that while the Neverending Story's symbols are quite accessible, Miyazaki's symbols are much more vague. German clarity permeates through Neverending Story, while the Japanese coexistence of sharp contrasts is prevalent in Spirited Away. Still, both are colossal monuments dedicated to imagination and creativity, and if that's what you like, you shouldn't skip watching this movie!","

"le canard","30 April 2002","This film is simply perfect. I know this may sound hollow and assertive but I just want everyone to know that Chihiro is one of the most beautiful and original and funny and poetic and exciting and brilliant film I have ever seen. I recently read an article which said that director Hayao Miyazaki wanted his films to be seen just once for he preferred viewers to just remember them and mentally reconstruct them using the power of their imagination. Well, that is an original point of view but I think Chihiro is exactly the kind of movie I'll always enjoy seeing over and over. Sorry, Hayao, but your poetry is far too addictive!","

"Aprigo","3 March 2006","I have given movies 10 out 10 stars before, but this just crosses a completely new line into something even above 100% greatness; perfection. This may be the only film I have ever seen that is completely perfect, I would change absolutely nothing about it. The only other film that I would put over the top is, coincedentally, My Neighbor Totoro. The fact that the are made by the same company has nothing to do with it.Whenever I watch this movie, not only do I find things that I didn't notice the time before, but I feel a sense of having already seen certain things in it before, somewhere else. But I haven't - it is just the originality, and the new ideas that other movies will build on from this one. Everything is perfect. The illustrations are detailed, flowing, and mesmerizing. The musical score is dead-on, and sneaks along in the background for most of the running. And the story takes on a form that I am attempting to do in my first work - complete layers. Two people could watch this, and come away with different ideas and plot lines. This is exactly what a movie should do, keep everyone that sees it thinking about it afterwards. There is no definite ending or beginning, it is left purely to the imagination.The entire film seems like just a slice of someone's imagination, and when I watch it, I consider it mine.","

"bix171","2 August 2003","Hayao Miyazaki's animated masterpiece is a very foreign film--and not simply because it comes from another country (Japan); there's an imagination at work that's so organic and remote that it seems to spring from an individual's subconscious and as such feels as if it has no immediate relation to a single culture. But it connects universally, speaking as it does in a language that suggests anything's possible and children of all cultures will respond to it instinctively. (And it will touch the inner child of adults.) There's a stunning clarity in Miyazaki's hand-drawn animation and it's clear that a painstaking effort is made to detail every frame. His use of color is striking and gratifying: rather than depend on the bright, flashy pastels that seem to be the choice of computer animators, he uses a rich but muted palate that emphasizes the dreamlike aspects of the story (a young girl must rescue her parents who have been turned into pigs by angry spirits and in turn discovers her capabilities for self-reliance; in this regard, it's not unlike most Disney films) and finds its pleasures in the darker aspects of the settings and the characters. The story takes its time to develop and though some may find it more arduous than entertaining (and, admittedly, its mildly humorous moments are few and far between), as it builds the rewards become more and more evident until, by its simply beautiful conclusion, it's overwhelmed you and left you dazed. Unique, infused with wisdom and love.","

"morindur","23 July 2003","Warning: This might contain minor spoilers...Having liked ""San"" (Mononoke Hime) a lot after having been dragged into I guessed I'd may appreciate ""Sen"" as well...  Having reached my fourth decade I'm usually somewhat shy if it comes to ""children's movies"", but I was most pleasantly surprised. This masterpiece of imagination and inspiration offers fun and suspense to the youngest, fun and a bit to think about to the young and a springwell of fascination to about everyone else (well, judging by some of the comments displayed over here, not quite everyone...). Anyway, I'd have never thought that a movie thus laden with morals and advice might work, but it does. There's a lot to learn from it:1. Don't be greedy. 2. Don't whine, do something instead. 3. Be kind to others. 4. You can't buy friendship. 5. If someone misbehaves, don't give him up. 6. If all else fails, an emetic might help...I give it a 9.5/10 --- the hopping lantern was just too much for me and the all too sudden ending did leave a thing or two to be desired...

"AllMT3","29 August 2003","You know the drill: Chihiro is a ten year old girl who gets trapped in the world of the spirits after her parents gorge themselves on spirit food and turn into pigs.My two cents worth: I've noticed a lot of people discussing in their comments that the movie ""doesn't feel whole"" or ""doesn't make sense"".  It has a dreamlike logic.  Things that seem perfectly ordinary at the time you watch it will make no sense when you try and explain it to somebody else. (Think ""Alice in Wonderland"")That having been said, this movie is completely involving and absolutely beautiful to look at.  The characters, as strange as many of them are, are completely believable.  It takes someone of great imagination to make a film like this, and make it work.  And this coming from someone who usually can't stand what most people term ""anime"".On a side note, I've noticed some parents complaining about this movie for various reasons.  The box for the movie says it is rated PG.  This is not a Disney PG where it's been rated for slapstick or the occasional bad word. This is a ""you're insane if you're letting any little kid who can't sit still for two hours/gets scared easily/under 7 years old watch this movie"" PG, kind of like Harry Potter was.Recommendations: If you like the story of Alice in Wonderland, you'll probably like this.  If you're into enthralling animated fantasy, I'd recommend ""The Last Unicorn"".  ""Flight of Dragons"" is also good, but doesn't hold up as well under repeat viewings.","

"jose-cruz53","7 October 2012","First I note that one should watch this film subtitled, while the American dub is rather high quality, it simply doesn't approach the quality of the Japanese voice acting in terms of conveying emotions. The same applies to any other language.Take one individual, one screen and 125 minutes. What's the best possible experience this individual could have by looking at the screen for 125 minutes? This is the best. Yep, while I could argue there are films one can get a better long experience by watching them over and over, gradually digesting it, the best ""one shot"" film ever made (that I have seem yet, from the thousands of films I have seem) is this.The experience I had watching this film for the first time was never equaled by any other film, I could say that only stuff like Beethoven's 9th Symphony had impressed me to a comparable degree. This is not a simple film, it is an spectacle of colors, sounds (with one of the best film scores ever) and emotions. It possesses an immersive power that I didn't though was possible for a film before watching it. Its sort of like 2001: A Space Odyssey on crack but with much more emotion and characterization. This is truly the best film of the 21st century (while I would put ""There Will be Blood"" is in a distant 2nd place).Also, I should note that I had never seem a feature length Japanese animated film before I saw this one. Those that say one needs to ""understand"" anime before watching this are clearly wrong. However, its true that this film doesn't match the preferences of everyone, specially those Americans that have had their brains programmed by a lifetime watching only American films to only like the canned products of Hollywood.","

"SimonJack","19 October 2022","""Spirited Away"" is an animated film with a plot very much like that of Lewis Carroll's 1866 novel, ""Alice's Adventures in wonderland."" Alice falls into a rabbit hole and finds herself a giant in a fantasyland that is made up of things that have human traits and characteristics. After she is reduced in size to fit the storybook characters, she encounters a myriad of creatures, in a zany trip through Wonderland. Some are funny, some a little scary at first, and most are silly to ridiculous. Often abbreviated, ""Alice in Wonderland,"" it's a wonderful story of nonsense and goofiness, and suitable for and pleasing to families and audiences of all ages. In the end, it turns out to have been a dream.I suspect that Hayao Miyazaki was influenced by Carroll's story when he put together ""Spirited Away."" Miyazaki is a celebrated artist and producer and director of animated stories - in the Japanese version of comic books and strips (manga), and films. He has been somewhat like Walt Disney in the production of stories for children, especially animated tales and films.This film has a young girl, Chihiro going with her parents to their new home. She didn't want to move, will miss her friends, and is somewhat scared about moving. When her dad takes a wrong turn off a turnpike, they wind up on a tree-covered road that comes to a dead end outside a tunnel. They walk through the tunnel and enter a different world. They spot what looks like an old theme park, and mom and dad smell the food. With no one around, they dig into the sumptuous layout, dad saying that they will pay when they leave. While they are eating, Chihiro wanders off, and the story takes off from there. She meets Haku, a flying dragon who changes into a boy and gives her directions.Instead of a wonderland, Chihiro is able to get into a huge floating castle-like bathhouse, with a stream of creatures of all kinds. Some are ghastly, others ghostly, and some colorful, silly, and downright ugly. Yubaba is a witch who runs the bathhouse and she changes Chihiro's name to Sen. Her adventures encounter somewhat darker characters than those Alice met in Wonderland. To be able to stay in the bathhouse, Sen must get a job in the place. She wants to find her parents and Haku shows her where they are. They had been turned into pigs. So, now her whole purpose is to be able to get her parents changed back and to get free.She must encounter many characters, go through some adventures, and have some strange and some funny and silly experiences. Never is there a sense of comedy here. There are curses and spells, magic and other witches, and a train that operates below the bathhouse running on a track that is under water. It's a strange world. In the end Chihiro finds her parents who wonder where she had wandered off to, and they walk back through the tunnel.The film is quite good, and interesting, for a time. But about half way through it's more than two-hour run time, I was looking for it to end soon When it didn't, I stuck with it just to see it all - with a couple of breaks, including one overnight till the next day. While I enjoyed animated films when young, especially the Walt Disney productions, by late middle-age I didn't care as much for fantasy and comic book stories and films. That include the Marvel comic book hero films. I still enjoy sci-fi, but it needs to have actors, sets and signs of real life.This film had rave reviews, and many sources have touted it as the greatest animated film of all time. Some sources have even labeled it one of the greatest films of all time. I'm not one to debate or argue with what people like and prefer to watch for entertainment. But, my understanding and appreciation for film is still with what the original industry was and what the Academy Awards and other recognitions were established for. That was to recognize the people in the movie industry who made movies. This included, especially, the actors, directors, producers, writers, cinematographers, set designers and builders, makeup artists, costumers, choreographers, painters and artists, songwriters, composers, etc.Animated films have much less human participation and far fewer crafts, trades and arts of theater on film. They are surely cheaper and much easier to produce. And, the younger public seems to be favoring more and more fantasy and fables than films about real life and people - whether dramas, mysteries, comedies, romance, family, Westerns, sci-fi, biographies, historical, etc. But, those are where my interests still lie. Except for the cartoon artists, some people to provide voices, and the filming and technical production, there is very little other human involvement in making animated films.There are no sets, costumes, makeup needs, lighting, expert camera or sound work, or other human elements of making films like this. Hayao Miyazaki wrote the story for this film and directed it. That means that he oversaw all of the drawing of the scenes, coordinating them in a story as he went along, and filming the drawings and recording the voices for the characters and the musical score and background. I don't object to awards for animated films; but perhaps that should be a separate industry all of its own. I won't rate the best animated films higher than 7. In my book, they can't compare to classic films with great stories, writing, actors, direction, sets, costume, filming and other cinema arts and crafts.","

And though confirmation of any sequel to Spirited Away has burned to the ground now that Hayao Miyazaki has retired, my hopes will still live on. Together Ghilbli studios and Hayao Miyazaki have dominated the anime world. I don't know how they come up with these stories, and I probably don't understand all of what it represents, but maybe that's why I can watch it repeatedly. I learn something new or notice something different every time I watch it.Just amazing. It's heartbreaking, adorable, comedic, intriguing and visually aesthetic all in one. I find no fault in this. So if you have any qualms about this film, I don't want to hear them. Peace.BEST ANIME FILM EVER.Read more reviews at championangels.wordpress.com","

"rh86","23 October 2006","People call Hiyao Miyazaki the Japanese Disney but his work puts him on a far higher plane and Spirited Away shows this. The film starts like a fairly typical take on Alice in Wonderland or Narnia. A modern day girl is bought into a fantasy world and has to find her way back. But Miyazaki takes it even further. His heroine, ten year old Chihiro is a typically modern girl, upset about moving house and afraid of her new life. But after her parents take a detour into a strange tunnel she finds herself trapped and worst of all, her parents have been turned into pigs.Miyazaki's fantasy world is quite simply jaw dropping. Strange creatures, some drawn from Japanese mythology others just from Miyazaki's mind populate this world and the bathhouse where Chihiro has to work. Just the images stay in your mind long after the end credits have rolled, an endless landscape of water, the cherry blossom fields.But it's not just the fantastic images that make this film one of the best. The characters are utterly compelling and it's easy to forget when watching them, particularly the evil witch Yubaba that they are just cartoons.Ignore any negative comments about this movie, an academy award, several million Japanese and countless film critics can't be wrong. Probably the best animated film since the early days of Disney (before it was all about the money).","

"ElMaruecan82","26 June 2017","""Spirited Away"" ventures in the realm of poetic fantasy through the life-changing journey of Chihiro, a ten-year old girl imprisoned in a world of spirits after her parents have been turned into pigs.This premise suggests a mixture of two universal stories immortalized (but not created) by Disney: ""Pinocchio"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"". The parents become pigs after they surrendered to gluttony in an unattended restaurant full of appetizing meals; the father mentions his credit card before swallowing a large spoonful of noodles like a pig, literally. Both adults are punished like the kids in Dream Island who made jackasses of themselves. Chihiro was spared because she felt something was wrong and only wanted (a bit cowardly) to get back to the car.There's a sort of 'immanent justice' governing this seemingly hostile universe, any action has either a cost or a reward, established by the wizard-like imagination of Hayao Miyazaki. Take the villainous Yubaba, a big-headed 'witch' who's also the tenant of a traditional bathhouse and the one who cursed Chihiro's parents, despite her evil ordeals, she's not as one-dimensional as the Coachman, she's a manager who believes in good work and good manners. She's as capable as complimenting and rewarding as she is in the 'punishing' department. It all comes to a moment halfway through the film, when you see the parent's punishment as a severe yet understandable answer to their lack of humility. But just because Chihiro didn't yield the temptation doesn't make her immune to the wrath of Yubaba. Chihiro wasn't too enthusiastic about the family moving to another town, she missed her friends and school, she's literally turned to the past, like an overprotected only child who can't get off her zone of comfort. After ""Pinocchio"", she's also a little Alice who doesn't dream about escapism but quite the opposite, and although she doesn't become a pig, her presence in that world has a reason, Chihiro is a girl who embraces the present and only wishes to have her parents back, but she has a few lessons to learn, not to redeem her parent's fault but to overcome her status-quo complex and the things she take for granted.Chihiro works as a slave for Yubaba, giving her name in exchange of safety. It's not exactly the name, but from what I gathered, a 'kenji', a sort of syllabus that changes her identity to Sen. Actually, the literal meaning of the Japanese title is the ""Disappearance of Sen and Chihiro"" as if Chihiro was incarnating the loss of Japanese memory, like her parents did when they forgot about basic courtesy in the name of money or like these human ghosts in that masterful train sequence, probable metaphors of Japanese people alienated by the modern world. By becoming two persons at once, Chihiro embarks on a transitional state, in a quest she knows nothing about, and neither do we, until the end, when the film unveils the message, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" did with the unforgettable 'there's no place like home'.Now, at that point of the review, I'll keep this simple and say that ""Spirited Away"" is also a visually rich experience full of Carrolian elements, such as animal-creatures and food with shape-changing power. It is populated by a vast gallery of characters, humans, toad-looking creatures, a boy named Haku who knows Chihiro's name but suffers from existential amnesia as well, there's also a spider-human hybrid working in the boiler room, helped by minuscule black minions (the closest to comic reliefs in the film). Miyazaki drained his imagination from Japanese folklore but he creates his worlds with an instinct in detail and harmony in the drawings that would make any foreigner feel 'at home'. Some elements will certainly be lost in translation, but it's like Kurosawa's movies, the core is universal.The clear line that became the trademark of the anime elevates the animation to the level of a noble art, one that creates realities of its own, or worlds that speak to our own perception of reality. And using his poetry and his delicate artistry, Miyazaki reprises the same themes than in ""Mononeke"" with a few variations: the former was about the battle between men and nature but this time, it's about the inner battle, causing men to disrespect the environment, forget about their identity and embrace life like money-driven robots or faceless ghosts. And it's not much that the film is about this stuff but the way it is. The effect on environment is demonstrated through a wonderful sequence involving the washing of a putrid creature, and the lure of gain is conveyed by the ""No Face"" character who gets anything he wants in exchange of gold nuggets.Things get easily out of control, until Chihiro refuses the gold nuggets because she didn't need them. All she wanted was to save her parents. As the movie progresses, you can fell the change going on, she's not the shy little girl who couldn't even climb down stairs, she became strong, mature, confidently walking on a very tight metal pipe, symbolically coming to age after a harrowing journey. A tale about modernity set in a traditional Japanese setting, ""Spirited Away"" belongs to that breed movies that embrace weirdness with such majestic confidence we can't feel more deceived when we get back to our flat and boring reality, speaking for myself, after watching two ""Miazaki"" in a row, I feel instinctively bored just thinking of the 'regular' animated movies.","

"playerazzi","12 July 2004","OK, the animation per se is great. But that's it. This is a romping, non-stop fantasy that takes us from one station to the next with no map in between. Wherethehellarewe?It is actually a scary movie, and I didn't understand the point in it.Our protagonist, Chihiro (sounds like Tihiro in the movie), is moving to a new town, which will bring a new school, and new friends, and she's not sure she can handle that. When their parents take a wrong turn, and Dad gets out of the car to explore the landscape, they end up in a ""trap"", in which her parents are tempted by delicious food, and turned into pigs. With me? Hold on. Now, Chihiro is befriended by Haku, a young feller who should be a romantic interest for her. But this doesn't really pan out, maybe because she is so young. Haku befriends her, and instructs her in how to get her parents back. She must do this by passing many tests. One of which is being able to identify her pig-parents from amongst the many pigs in the sty. What's the point here? Dunno. So, she's got to go through this bath-house where spirits come to get washed up. Huh? Yea, well, hold tight there . . . Seems the lady in charge (with a really gross huge face reminiscent of - yes - the Queen of Hearts of Alice fame) is a witch by the name of Yababa (sounds like I'm-baba in the movie), and for some reason she can get Chihiro out. But she first steals her name. OK, nevermind. Hoo-boy. If you are American or European, forget it. Especially if you don't like fantasy (I don't, can you tell?)What I *did* like was seeing hints of Japanese culture, such as:* They drive on the left side of the road. * The new town is in the hills. Where are there NOT hills in Japan?* They eat with chopsticks. Cool. * Protocol - ie, how you behave and manners - is very important.Chihiro doesn't know when she is going ""inside"", and so when she forgets to leave her shoes she is reminded that she is going inside. 'Nuff said.* This is the best - the most horrible monster is a Sludge Monster, who brings sludge and guck into the bathhouse. This is the most frightening thing - not a thief, not a drug pusher, not a rapist, not a murderer, no, no, that's not scary. The most frightening thing is to get sludged and all dirty. To the clean-conscious Japanese this must be a horrible prospect indeed.* When Yababa steals Chihiro's name, she does so by taking four of the five Kanji characters used to spell ""Chihiro"", and leaving one, thereby spelling ""Sen"". I do not read Japanese, but this was clear to me. Super Cool.* Trains are used for important transportation, as they are in Japan.* Chihiro and Len sit down and eat this Japanese food that looks like falafel, wrapped up all neat. Anyone know what it is?* Finally, and this I learned by reading the posts here, Shinto, the Japanese religion, is animist. This means that inanimate objects are imbued with a ""spirit"" . . . . <***SPOILER***> ------------------------------------------ Chihiro says she ""knows"" Haku, and apparently Haku is not a feller at all, but a river spirit re-incarnated into human form. Well, he's occasionally a dragon. He's a switch-hitter. First time Chihiro sees him as a dragon, she knows it's him, but why this is so is never made clear. Anyway, Haku the river spirit once saved Chihiro's life when she fell into the river at one point. Bottom line: just BORROW the video, don't spend a dime on it. Or a yen. Whatever.","

"tfrizzell","28 May 2003","The Best Animated Feature Oscar winner of 2002 is an odd cinematic product that makes very little sense and seems interminable at times (running approximately 125 minutes total). The film comes from Asian writer/director Hayao Miyazaki, a noted animator who has been in the medium for over 30 years. ""Spirited Away"" concerns a young girl who is moving with her parents to a new home, but a detour along the way forces the youth to grow up quicker than expected. An old abandoned theme park is discovered and soon her parents have turned into pigs and she is forced into a mystical world of large frogs and other strange creatures. Now she must find a way to get her parents back to their human forms and return to her rightful place in the world. Overall the animation goes beyond the Toonami realm and is technologically impressive. Also the musical score is reminiscent of that from ""The Last Emperor"" and it gives the film an added dimension that it desperately needed. The look and sound of the movie definitely save the day as the story is a pure mess. ""Spirited Away"" is too long and dull for children and is much too disjointed for most adults to get anything out of. Still an interesting movie, but far from as great as many would lead you to believe. 4 stars out of 5.","

"Puke Bag","16 October 2002","This is a film that deserves a much wider release than it is currently getting.  Taking a cue from Alice in Wonderland and Wizard of Oz, Hayao Miyazaki takes the fairy tale conventions and gives us one of his finest works yet, beating the pants off everything he has done before.In a world where Japanese animation gets a bit of a bad rap for its adult-content (despite the fact that it's no worse than North American mainstream cinema), comes a film that both adults and children can enjoy. It's best that you walk in with no expectations as I did.","

"b_havag","29 December 2008","Domo Arigato (thank you very much) to all the voters who gave this feature such an high score and guided me to see how superior ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" is even to the best Disney and Pixar films. To be much better than ""Ratatouille"", ""The Lion King"" and ""The Incredibles"" is quite an achievement. I had never thought that I would see animated features better than those. Cause I really like Disney/Pixar though it seems almost boring next to this.Chihiro is a nervous little girl who's on the move with her parents. When they're on the way to their new home, they get lost on a road into the woods and ends up in a tunnel who leads to something they think is an abandoned amusement park. When the parents start eating from a table full of delicious food who just happens to be on a table in this place, the day turns to night, her parents turn to pigs and the world changes to something scary, weird and completely different...This tale is the work of geniuses. I have never seen such an always captivating film filled to the brim with wonderful and unique characters, as well as an original, exciting and constantly surprising story. The feature contains an amazing mixture of adventure, action and drama with some drops of cream comedy on the top. I simply couldn't take my eyes away from the screen a second of the two hours, two hours who felt more like 30 minutes. It is such extraordinary entertainment to watch Chihiro using the power of courage and love to save her loved ones. I could keep going on with the superlatives but you have probably taken my point by now. I definitely recommend this movie in Japanese with subtitles. It simply feels much more natural that way than it does dubbed. All in all ""Spirited away"" is the best animated feature and even one of the best films I have ever seen. I nearly never give movies 10/10 but this time I simply must.","

"aleclemlij","17 April 2009","I'm a huge Ghibli fan and admit this was a great movie and deserved every single prize it won. Had some cute ""Ghibli treats"" like the Susuwataris (Totoros Dust Bunnies) but overall, and maybe for the first time, I didn't felt the originality Ghibli has everyone used to: Whole concept of being trapped inside a new world and trying to save it before returning to their own reminded me a lot of Neverending Story. Could be coincidence in there, but then you see that Chihiro must protect her identity and name before she forgets it. Exactly the same happened to Bastian. Haku can turn into a flying dragon (although his hair reminds me of Atreyu), Neverending story has Falcor the luck dragon. I read the book and watched the movies as a kid, I see a heavy influence here. Spirited away is a great film, I just didn't saw anything new. Not Ghiblis best. Probably number 3 next to Princess Mononoke and Grave of the fireflies. (I'd give this title 5 stars, you can thank NoFace for the extra ones)","

"mastercheif77","25 September 2004","As a child, i have distinct memories of watching ""My Neighbor Totoro"", at the local movie theatre. I must say, that this movie is reminiscint of that feeling. It might just be the dazzling collaboration of computer animation, and the classic anime animation, but this movie is eye candy. That isn't the only great thing about it though. It has a very compelling story line, that goes up there with some other great films, that will forever hold a place in our hearts. Another dazzling feature in this movie, is the music. It perfectly mixes, classical, European music, and Japanese music, it its glory. I must say, that when i first saw this movie, i had no idea that it existed. That isn't in any way a problem though, considering that most originally Japanese movies aren't very well known in America. Overall, this movie is simply brilliant, and actually made me feel like a better person. It also includes many different, deep ideas, that actually caught my attention, and my heart strings, much more than anything that could come out of ""The Matrix"" or something. So, indeed, this movie is one of the greatest, which i have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I would completely recommend seeing it, and i am giving it a perfect 10/10.","

"Bored_Dragon","13 April 2018","Although I don't like the anime style of animation, it didn't bother me this time. The story, if it is literal, does not make much sense, the characterization is lousy, and the motivation of the characters' actions is completely unclear. If the story is symbolic, maybe I did not understand it. One of the reasons for this may be that there was no script for the film, but it was written along the way. There is also a cultural gap between the East and the West. The authors were aware of this, so English-language synchronization contains more text than the original Japanese version, in order to explain to the Western audience some of the things that the Japanese perceive. But I was watching the original Japanese version, so I was deprived of these explanations. Based on what I have written so far, it looks like I didn't like it, but it's not so. All objections are negligible before the unique beauty of this accomplishment. Rationally, I would impose an average grade of five, or perhaps six, but this film does not aim at reason, but wins at a much deeper level. That's why in 2003 it won the award that suits it the best - Best Movie for Grownups Who Refuse to Grow Up. In addition, it won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, as the first anime ever nominated in this category. It is also one of the two animated films that have ever won Japan Academy Prize for picture of the year, and it holds the 27th place on the IMDb Top 250. Deserved.8/10","

"fedtho","6 July 2004","I distinctly remember that, on the way out of the theatre, I realized I had totally forgotten about the film being an animation!I couldn't remember, and still can't, when I was that drawn into a movie and into the world of an author. Certainly very subjective, but I felt that this work speaks to the child AND to the grown-up in me, and I didn't experience that so often...The incredibly intense moods, particularly some very calm moments where nothing happens, almost no sound... beyond words at its best moments (which, to me, is: most of the time!), though I admit - to give it the honesty it certainly deserves - having being a bit lost in the overwhelming diversity of caracters and events some times...But that's really nothing compared to what this film gave to me (I didn't even say ""film"" on purpose...).Not the one to watch if you want to get violently distracted... (Mission impossible 1 & 2, Terminator 1 - 3, and so on).Definitely worth watching, I'd put it in my top ten of the past ten years.How do you describe emotions? This movie shows what pictures and sound can do when a master is using them to let his soul speak...","

It leaves me with a huge list of questions I cannot answer. Is it a real experience? Is it a dream? Is it a magical spell? What really happened? Are the characters symbolic or allegorical? (Should I study Japanese mythology to learn more?) Chihiro is moving to a new home. A spoiled brat, unhappy in the back seat of her parents car, she is taken, unwilling, into a strange world when her father takes what he thinks is shortcut that becomes a dead end. Tired of driving, he wants to explore. Chihiro is afraid, but she is more afraid of being left behind.They find what seems to be an abandoned theme park, where her hungry parents come on a restaurant. They sit down and start to eat. Chihiro is too nervous to eat, so she wanders off. When she comes back, her parents have magically been turned into pigs. And so the magic begins.You don't need to write a master's thesis on this movie to enjoy it. You don't need to answer any of your questions to enjoy it. In fact, this movie stays with you. Its scenes will wake you at night with insights and beauty. The music will haunt you, though I challenge you to remember a single musical theme.I have experienced genius here. I am in awe.","

"baseballfanjm","21 August 2003","Possible spoilers ahead. When I rented ""Spirited Away"", I was unsure about all the hype I've heard about it, about it being an utter masterwork. Hayao Miyazaki's ""Princess Mononoke"" is one of my favorite movies and I didn't know how he could top it. But did he ever. I'm at a loss for words. Mastery doesn't begin to describe this. It's too bad that this is Miyazaki's, I believe, last film. Today, CGI is all the rage, and many believe that the days of traditional animation are coming to an end. But ""Spirited Away"" is a movie that could never be done with computers. Sure, it'd be crisper looking, technically ""better looking"". But CGI would ruin the subtlety, thesimplicity that makes it so brilliant. Don't get me wrong, CGI has rightly earned a place in the film industry. But I hate the idea of all animation being CGI.
Anyway, back to the movie. ""Spirited Away"", is so remarkably beautiful is somany ways. On shot that got to me in particular was when Chihiro, after being shown what has happened to her parents by her friend, Haku, is walking away.After crossing a bridge, she looks back, and Haku has transformed into adragon. We can see him, but only at a distance, like how we'd see a majesticeagle, framed against the sky. This shot is too simple and beautiful for words. Nothing in this is too bombastic, nothing overdone, and for two hours and takes us on an amazing journey that only a master of animation, like Miyazaki, cantake us on. I'll never forget watching ""Spirited Away"" and I beg anyone who has bothered to read this review to watch this movie as soon as possible. I doubt you'll forget either.","

Since I need to have a certain number of words I will just put a few things in even though I could go on and on about this movie. First of all this movie above all else looks fantastic. It looks like nothing else and really understand that film is a visual medium that can be used to tell a story and introduce a viewer to characters that they are able to become invested in. I do not know how much I relate to Chihiro, but I was completely invested in her adventure. There was so much character growth shown in obvious actions and behaviors, but it felt genuine and never forced. No Face will always be one of my favorite characters of all time and that is because of what he achieves with so little time on screen and almost no dialog. I love everything about this movie and there are no weak points in the film. This movie will always maintain a special spot in my heart and is truly one of the finest films ever made in my opinion.","

"gomaster88","8 July 2005","Here I find myself again reviewing another great Miyazaki movie. Spirted Away in my opinion is probably the second best Miyazaki movie to date with Grave of the Fireflies in first and Naussica in third. Spirted Away is a great movie for kids and adults alike. I found that it was not very scary, but some moments your kids might find more frightening then others. In this film it doesn't seem to have much of the nature mixed in with the plot, though when Chihiro meets the River Spirit he has tons of trash inside of his body, which is what Miyazaki saw in a river my his city while he was walking. It is rated PG for scary image. I give it a 9.25 out of 10.","

"deastman_uk","7 October 2003","When the heroines parents turn into pigs as punishment for their greed, leaving a young girl to solve the problems of the fantasy world she has entered, the viewer is immediately sucked in too.This animated feature is both vivid and entertaining, and while there is no attempt to be in original in the overall plot, the fantasy world depicted is certainly novel. The story is told in detail, from beginning to end, with charm and wit. While there is no doubt that this is Japanese, the film is on the whole Westerner friendly - the myths and fears pervading the story are ones most people are familiar with. This is a very good time for animation - with the array of styles available to producers (the Animatrix displays many of these) writers can get on with their job and let the animators do their job. The result is films like Spirited Away. I think a lot more writers who previously would not have considered animation must now be taking a second look.",NA

Start eating the food with the intent of settling later, or (b.) abstain from eating--regardless of the temptation--because it was wrong. In the film, two out of three respondents answered (a.) and were transformed into what they behaved as: pigs. Such starts out Hayao Miyazaki's finest work to date, ""Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi."" (""Spirited Away"" in US theaters) This is the finest animated film I have ever seen and is near the top of my list of films of any genre.The main character of the story, a 10-year old girl named Chihiro Ogino, is a normal child thrust by her parents into a strange world and is immediately left to fend for herself--as she was the one out of three who chose the correct course of action by not eating the food. Throughout the remainder of this beautiful film, she is faced with numerous choices--each crafted by Miyazaki to emphasize the importance of living a virtuous life. While the specific cases use things from Japanese folklore, traditions, and culture (and Miyazaki's incredible imagination), the fundamental virtues apply Universally to all.One admonition: the English-dubbed version, though touted as being true to the original, actually changes the nature of the film slightly.The original Japanese language release, subtitled if necessary, is a truer rendition of Miyazaki's imagination.On a scale of ten, I'd give this one an 11.",NA

"ragg_adam","22 April 2005","I recently bought this on DVD for my 11 year old sister as a birthday present. The only real background info on it I had at the time was that it was an anime in the vein of Alice In Wonderland. However, in all aspects, (including the one that is most often in contention among anime fans, the English dub,) reached and then exceeded my expectations.Chihiro is a little girl who is unwilling to join in with her gung-ho parents who are setting off to live in a new town. However, when her father's bad driving has them at a dead end in a forest glade, they discover a tunnel that leads into what seems to be an abandoned theme park town. However, when the sun goes down it becomes clear that this is a ghost town of a different sort, a place where spirits return each evening to relax and refresh themselves. Chihiro finds herself working at the towering Bath-house of the Spirits and trying to find a way of getting back to her home, encountering many incredible creatures along the way, including the brave water spirit/dragon Haku, gruff but kindly boiler-man Komaji, cranky witch/owner of the bath-house Yubaba and the mysterious wraith No-Face.On the strength of the US English dub, it is an enjoyable and exhilarating film, with a well-written story, fantastic dialogue and, given the nature of the film, totally believable characters. Daveigh Chase is marvelous as Chihiro, and brings across her complex emotional states brilliantly. The supporting cast, including many Disney regulars, are on top form, and whilst it has no real stars on board, the skill of those involved proves it isn't necessary. I often found myself wondering if Wendee Lee was one of the cast members, but on discovering it was Susan Egan I felt like a complete dolt. David Ogden Stiers, the Peter Sellers of Disney, is a treat as Komaji, and Jason Marsden and Suzanne Pleshette are fairly engaging as Haku and Yubaba/Zeniba respectively. Bob Bergen and John Ratzenberger both make good cameos as well.The visuals and sound are crisp and clean and unpretentious, the story is accessible whilst still being quirky and inventive. Whilst at the time of it's release I was repelled by the fact that it seemed a tad too Disney-ish, I now think I can safely say I was wrong. This isn't Alice In Wonderland; it's in a whole different class.And by the way, my sister loved it too.",NA
"sme_no_densetsu","4 October 2008","Coming into this film I had recently watched a trio of Miyazaki's earlier efforts and was looking forward to seeing his most highly regarded film. I can now say that I have never seen anything quite like this, though the unbridled creativity turned out to be a bit of a double-edged sword in my case.Outwardly the story is simple enough as Chihiro and her parents stumble upon a seemingly abandoned amusement park and unwittingly trespass into a world governed by spirits. It is then up to Chihiro to gain passage for herself and her parents back to the real world.The story's characters and events are probably not as original to Japanese viewers but as a North American viewer I found the content to be exceptionally weird and imaginative. In fact, I found it so original that I was half the time slack-jawed, saying to myself, ""What is going on here?"" Thankfully, by the end of the film the world of ""Spirited Away"" made a bit more sense.The voice cast (for the Disney dub) is fine but unremarkable. There's no-one worth singling out, either for a stand-out performance or a particularly lackluster one.The visuals are top-notch, as is typical of Studio Ghibli. I don't know if Disney meddled with the score like they did with other Miyazaki films but, if they did, it is none the worse for their efforts.If you're looking for originality, look no further.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","9 November 2009","While I have not yet watched an awful lot of Animé, I can say that this is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. The animation is crisp and gorgeous, the style is excellent and with the right amount of motion to it, and design is impeccable, with beautiful, grotesque and amazing images presented for us to take in. Lighting and color palette are broad and well-chosen. An immense amount of imagination and creativity went into this, and you can feel it from start to finish. We are presented with a fascinating, strange world, an our trip to and around it is engaging. With a running time of just over two hours, this is the longest of its kind. However, it has spot-on pacing, never boring or overstimulating the audience members to the point where you take a break from your viewing, in spite of the odd, and once or twice even disgusting, things that this shows us. It is also open to interpretation. And in spite of that, it also tells a story so that anyone, of any age, can follow it. Not everyone will understand everything that's going on, but we can all enjoy it. I can only comment on the original actors, as I did not choose a dubbed version; their work is marvelous, and that goes for every performance. The dialog is well-written. Apart from some potentially scary and/or disturbing content, there is nothing offensive in this. The DVD comes with 18 minutes(!) worth of trailers for it, and, on the second disc, the whole movie in storyboard form, with a commentary track, subtitled in English, a well-done, informative and entertaining 47 minute making-of featurette made up of behind the scenes footage, concept art, clips and narration(in Japanese, subtitled).

"Laserwolf65","9 June 2010","Some call Hayao Miyazaki the Disney of Japan. In regards to this movie, I would like to offer my own analogy: he is the Don Bluth of Japan--he's an amazing animator, but a horrible storyteller.The story starts out with Chichiro and her parents. They stop off at what looks like an empty carnival and the parents begin eating. This show of gluttony and greed transforms the parents into pigs, and as night falls, the spirits that inhabit this place come out. Chichiro winds up trapped with the spirits and winds up being captured by a witch who steals her name and forces her to work in the witch's bath house. Now it's up to Chichiro to get free and save her parents.There are obviously more characters that I have not mentioned, but that in a nutshell is the plot. The problem is that Miyazaki doesn't want to develop it. Instead he opts for what seems like 1000 different sub-plots.One deals with a river spirit, one deals with the witch's sister, another deals with a spirit called No-face, and the list goes on. The main plot is essentially forgotten until the very end of the film, and is resolved in the most trite of ways.This is really the movie's big problem. It's as if Miyazaki and crew came up with a million ideas, and rather than pick one or two, they picked all of them. It doesn't only affect the plot, but also the look of the film. I understand that many of the creatures are traditional Japanese spirits (and I'll be the first to admit my lack of knowledge of Japanese culture), but there were simply too many weird creatures that serve no purpose. The witch for example has a baby that fills an entire room and three severed heads as assistants. Why? Because they could.I honestly hated this movie. When it was finished I felt flabbergasted. It was uninvolving, nonsensical, pretentious, and boring. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I honestly cannot understand why this movie is so well-loved. In my humble opinion, it is complete and utter drek.",NA
"Bing5253","31 July 2006","Spirited away is definitely one of my favourite animated films of all time. The main character is Chihiro, a girl that has moved away from her old home and school. On their way to their old house, Chihiro, her mum and her dad stumble across and abandoned theme park. Or at least, they think it's abandoned. Soon, Chihiro is ends up in a world of magic, evil witches and strange creatures. Spirited away keeps you gripped from the very beginning. It is one of Miyazaki's many masterpieces and a movie that you will be able to watch several times. Also, this movie is not just for children, I'm sure that adults will love it too.10/10",NA
"Stampsfightclub","24 January 2010","When her parent's spirits are consumed by their own greed, Chihiro must work in a bath house to find a way to rescue them, only for her to become sidetracked in a troubled place The first anime film to win an Academy Award brings together a collection of vivid imagination and collective youthful experience and innocence from acclaimed director Hayao Miyazaki that is certainly worth seeing for numerous reasons.This film to me has a somewhat emotional impact. When I was young I loved watching the Pokémon series along with Card Captors and others and having been absent from such animation for many years, watching this film revives that love of careful and beautiful cartoon styling with an exuberant fantasy and imagination that is irreplaceable.This was partly the reason I watched it but for a better reason reviewers had critically acclaimed this picture as a work of genius and it is easy to see why.Pixar are the current global kings of animation seemingly unbeaten in box office records across the world. Creating stories revolving around real world issues but containing imagination adds to their appeal, none more so than Toy Story and Wall-E. Spirited Away follows a similar attraction, bringing in many traditions of its Japanese maker.The film is a spirited fantasy that creates wonderful illusions of possibilities. There are brilliantly designed soot like spiders, a humungous Granny typed villain, pig parents, a gold given anything eating no faced monster and a floating train ride. The design is something otherworldly that can' be explained unless seen. However it is what these pictures and designs symbolise in the stories' context.The greedy self obsessed parents, the contemplation of thoughts and a slowdown on the train, the impact of friendship against adversity and the manipulation of gold and other riches in a working environment. This is not just fancy showy art this is meaningful and picturesque entertainment.Whilst the same could be said for Pixar this 2001 release has in my opinion one of the finest scores to grace an animation. The complete juxtaposition of music and moment may bring tears to your eyes. The train scene near the end is the best moment as signs fly by and the day turns into night and people move on, a heavenly scene of pure movie magic.On first viewing I was astounded by the film's conformity to many ideologies such as magic, parenthood, slavery, love, lust, youth and manipulation. Come the final showdown there was a multitude of quick fired ideologies that mashed everything together and left the film hovering for the viewer's personal interpretation.There are a few unanswered questions and a few eyebrows may rise and that's also part of the beauty as this, without a shadow of a doubt, contains all the necessary elements to entertain anyone of any age, truly brilliant.",NA
"alexduffy2000","27 August 2003","I've never seen an animated film like ""Spirited Away.""  It's a great, unpredictable story, you will root for Chihiro all the way.  Miyazaki creates a spirit world that is so removed from everyday reality that I wanted to believe in it so much, I wanted to visit it, even though there are dangers.  See this wonderful, original work of genius!",NA
"sweavo","26 September 2003","I promised I'd post a comparative review of the dubbed version and, I hate to say it, the subtitled one is better.  The dubbing rather than being a faithful translation and interpretation actually changes the exposition and employs the hollywood lump-hammer to drive 'subtle' points home.  I can't give an example without spoilers, but what she says when she's on the bridge and sees the squiggle in the sky loses a lot of subtlety.  It seems to reflect on US adults giving US kids less credit for intelligence than Japanese adults give their kids.Also, the moment when Chihiro first weeps is completely robbed of its significance by bad voice direction allowing far too much emotion to come out too early.  What in the japanese version comes across as anxiety comes across in the dubbed version as anguish or anger.Sorry, I tried to leave my ""brie"" at home!",NA
"KnightsofNi11","19 August 2011","Unprecedented creativity and imagination abound in this glorious fantasy adventure from acclaimed director Hayao Miyazaki. Spirited Away tells the story of a little girl named Chihiro who finds herself reluctantly moving to a new home with her parents at the beginning of the film. On the way they make a stop at a mysterious ghost town and Chihiro's parents indulge themselves with some food left out on a counter. This causes them to turn into pigs and Chihiro runs away in fear, only to find herself in a strange new world full of gods and spirits all coming across the river to visit the luxurious bath house that Chihiro must find work in if she is to stay safe in the other world. In this strange fantasy land she meets gods of all shapes and sizes, evil witches, giant babies, and even dragons. It is an immaculate and beautiful film, but it is also an incredibly touching story that gleams with love and compassion. It's a true work of visual and emotional art.It is amazing how much the great Hayao Miyazaki can immerse us in his fantasy world. There's something so incredible about the look of the world and just how every last bit of it stays true to a unique style that Miyazaki has assigned it. Every creature is as astoundingly awesome as the last, which is saying a lot because of the vast diversity of every character and creature in this movie. You have everything from the employees of the bath house which look like offbeat crosses between frogs and humans, to the shadowy No Face who is, in a way, just a black blob with a mask, but is also fascinating to watch because of the unique flare which presides over the entire atmosphere of the film. Even the characters that serve no real purpose to the storyline and are in a way just animated extras look amazing. The bath house is full of these strange looking characters that never become uninteresting to look at.It's also nice that these fascinating characters fit in with an amazing story and a great concept. The whole idea of a bath house for the spirits just baffles me as to how they came up with that. And the way the concept provides such a great backdrop for the rest of the story is perfect. The story is incredibly unique anyways, but making the main setting a spirit world bath house is, to me, ingenious in all sorts of ways. I'm not sure why it works so perfectly, but it does.The film also has an excellent sense of humor that is totally appropriate at all times. It never distracts from the story and only adds a charming and lovable quality to the characters and the concept of the film. There are plenty of great moments that received a great laugh from me and in just the right quantities, never impeding on the rest of the film's brilliance. It is always a joy for me when I can laugh so hard and yet be moved so much. That is the precise effect Spirited Away has on me. There are absolutely beautiful moments of this film that possess a kind of sophistication and eloquence that rivals that of a more adult oriented film of this calibre. Spirited Away isn't just good for a kid's movie, it's just plain good.Hayao Miyazaki is nothing less than a genius. His imagination is so powerful and so influential that to not be astounded by something he has accomplished would make me question your humanity. Spirited Away is undoubtedly one of his greatest triumphs, and for good reasons. There is practically nothing wrong with this film. It is a masterpiece that will surely stand the test of time and be hailed as a classic for years to come. It is so creative, so beautiful, so touching, and so fun. It's everything you could ask for in a film, plus a little more.",NA
"jace_the_film_guy","31 July 2023","How in the world did I not see this movie until now? The film is full to the brim with absurdities, but not in a crude or immature way. It takes that which is strange and elevates it to a maturity unknown in most animated films.The characters are unique, the setting is complex, and I am constantly drawn back for more. It has quickly become a comfort film and something that I want to watch on a rainy night.My biggest gripe with the movie is the central plot direction. I was intrigued during the first hour, curious about where the story was heading. Ultimately, the story doesn't go much of anywhere. It's not a bad thing, it just left me wondering about the vision and purpose of certain characters. That being said, there is so much to love about ""Spirited Away"" The filmmakers' approach to illustrating pain, change and fear is incredibly well done. Plus, I could listen to the score on repeat for days.Best Character: Chihiro

"Aaron1375","2 March 2009","I saw the movie ""Re-Cycle"" not that long ago and people on boards for that film talked about two scenes that resembled each other so I wanted to see this one. I have seen another film made by this company ""Nausica"" and I could tell there were similarities in music and animation style. Well the bridge scene was a bit similar, but my girlfriend says there are a lot of tales in Asian culture of holding your breath so the spirits can not see you so it really was not to a like. Actually, I found this movie while a bit flawed here and there for my tastes more entertaining than that other film and much more whimsical. A girl and her parents are driving to their new home and get detoured along the way and end up at what appears to be the entrance to a long abandoned theme park. Well the daughter, named Chihiro has a bad feeling about this place, but her parents just have to explore. Suffice to say the daughter's bad premonition about this place turns out to be correct as the parents stumble upon a lot of food in one of the buildings in this place and proceed to eat the food like Goku eats in Dragonball Z. In the end the girl ends up trapped in what is the spirit world, and this theme park which is actually a bath house for the spirits. The girl ends up getting employed by the witch who runs the bath house and has her name basically stolen by her as she goes from Chihiro to Sen, a boy named Haku at times seems to want to help her and at others seems cold to her. Her parents are pigs, a strange creature seems to really like her and she gets to meet all sorts of interesting new chaps. The problems I found with the piece you ask? Well despite a rather lengthy runtime of 125 minutes it still feels like it needed more. Many interesting plot points wrapped up with not enough development, like No-Face. The twin sister's strange turnaround in they way she acted and treated the girl. The way she gets back seems a tad rushed too, however for the most part this movie was simply a delight.",NA
"derfybarfy","11 January 2006","What this movie does so well, and why i love it so much, is because it takes me to a completely different world, so beautifully drawn and so magically in every single aspect and filled with wonderful characters that makes this film, like no other film, leave me with an inner joy that is indescribable.The only thing i truly hate about this film, is that I'm always so disappointed when it's over, and I'm left in this boring inferior world called ""reality"" again.Anyways, if you for some weird reason haven't watched it yet, i got one advice for you:Watch it. Now.",NA
"sweavo","22 September 2003","I wouldn't go so far as to say I ""followed"" this but I certainly enjoyed it. The world pierced right down into my subconscious and some of the images have stayed with me for over a week now.  I watched it subtitled and enjoyed it, though may have missed some of the visuals and dialogue.  Those who found the dubbed voice ""uncharming"" might want to check this version. Going to see the dubbed version soon and will follow up with a comparison.Masterpiece?  Well, I'm not sure the plot was *all that* but the visual spectacle and the raw creativity that went into the world and characters were top notch and very refreshing.  You just better pray your 10-year-old doesn't ask you questions about the film afterwards because you won't be able to come up with satisfactory answers!There are many great messages in the film but nothing is driven home with the customary lump-hammer the American movies often use to make points on childhood, growing up, responsibility, confronting your fears, care for the environment, honour, hard work... I need to watch this again to get more from the symbols used.",NA
"rainking_es","14 March 2007","To find stories such as ""The journey of Chihiro??"" , full of magic and fantasy, of real values and good vibrations it's quite difficult nowadays. Finally we got a quality product for the children (and for those who are not children too!), just like the ones of the good ol' days, far away from the Disney stuff and its prudiness. Those who were children in the 80's will find in ""Chihiro"" some reminiscences of Michael Ende's ""Neverending story"".As for the animations, some of the characters are much m ore expressive than most of the young Hollywood actors!! The best fantasy movie in years, no doubt about it. For the younger and for the older.*My rate: 8/10",NA
"benthelazar","26 March 2014","If I were to watch one movie as I lay dieing, it would definitely be Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away (2001). I would like to die right at the moment when Chihiro and No Face are the last ones on the train. But in all honesty, any moment in this movie would be a great final sight. It has some of the most impressive animation in the history of the art, but it also tells one of the greatest stories in movie history. It's a basic coming of age story, but with such imagination, emotion and well made characters that it is one that will be watched and enjoyed a hundred years from now, that I have no doubt.The story follows a ten year old girl named Chihiro and her quest to save her parents from a bathhouse running witch named Yubaba. If that does not hook you, I don't know what will. Add some beautifully drawn river spirits and bizarre creatures that would shock even Lewis Carroll, and you've got the makings of a great movie.Besides the fantastic story and characters, the thing that makes this a masterpiece is that it's a tremendous labor of love that is. Not that it was difficult to make, considering the fact that Miyazaki is animated gold, but that there are hundreds of unnecessary little details that cement the movies beauty. The way water moves and reflects, for example. It is so realistic that we became totally engrossed in the story. Or look in the windows of the bathhouse. You will find whole stories that have no connection to the central one, but they give such a feeling of busyness and movement that I couldn't imagine the movie without them. Most backgrounds in animated movies are very still, they can't distract from the story. But the ones in Spirited Away demand your attention. It's a good thing that the story is so compelling.The story is a basic coming of age type deal. But most of us take a long time to make the progress that that Chihiro makes of the course of the movie. Sometimes we wish there was an event like this one that would inspire us to take action. But usually a single event that causes maturity is a tragic or traumatic one, where as Chihiro's is one of spectacular adventure. Scary, yes, but she faces it with great bravery so that the trauma questions that usually pop up in the back of my head in movies like this never come up in Spirited Away.I mentioned fantastic creatures, and this movie delivers them, I think more than any other movie. They are powerful creatures of few words, who let their very existence be their power. My personal favorite is the Radish Spirit. He looks vaguely like Meat Loaf in Fight Club (1999) and does little except for ride in an elevator with Chihiro and do a happy dance. But the tantalizing possibility of the existence of such an incredible creature has elevated him to one of my favorite movie characters. The most affecting is Stink God. I remember a tremendous feeling of sadness hit me when he slimed in the rain towards the bath house. He was so alone and hated, you can't help but feel sympathy for him (plus, he inspires a great reaction from Chihiro). But the most memorable is No Face. He is one one of the great misunderstood monsters of the screen. When Chihiro shows him a little kindness, he tries to repay her in any way he can, which involves hurting some people on accident. With minimal noise, he inspires great sympathy and awe. He is also a wonder of animation, disappearing from scene to scene, rapidly changing in size and seemingly texture.As the story draws to it's conclusion, it's an interesting to note that we want Chihiro to return to the human world. This is a snag that many children's movies hit. Why would you want human friends if you have Totoro or why would you go back to Kansas if you have Oz? But there is enough peril in the bathhouse and Chihiro is human enough that she needs to return to the human world; she has no place with the spirits.Consider the title. Nobody ever says that in the movie, in fact Chihiro takes her entry into this fantastic world very rationally. But the title is directed to us, the audience. We are spirited away to a place beyond the imagining of mere mortals. Miyazaki lets us in on his mad dreams, and we couldn't care less.",NA
