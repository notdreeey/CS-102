"planktonrules","26 March 2019","""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is a fantastic film but might be a bit overwhelming for some viewers. It's filled with blaring hip-hop music and the animation is beyond splashy...it's competely intense! Now these are NOT criticisms...more a warning if you hate these sorts of things or if you or someone you loves has challenges, such as Autism....as the film might really be overwhelming. Still, I'm nearly 55 and loved the picture...and I think most will if they have an open mind and want something different. That DOES strongly apply to me, as I've gotten sick of superhero movies because there have been so many recently and there's a certain sameness about them...but not this Spider-Man film!The story is told with breathtaking CGI--with a look that is nothing like any other film I've ever seen. In this world is a young man who sees Spider-Man killed and is also bitten by a spider and becomes the next incarnation of Spider-Man. But instead of taking the time to enjoy and learn about his new powers, this young man finds himself in the middle of a weird apocalyptic occurance---and all the various incarnations from the various universes come together to save the day.Overall, amazingly creative...there's nothing else like it. This is more than reason enough to see it. Sadly, however, the film loses a bit on home TVs...even big ones as the scale and size of the film needs the big screen.","

"Hitchcoc","19 November 2019","So many have commented, so I will be brief. From an intriguing plot to wonderful characterizations using drop dead animation, this film works. About ten minutes into it it thought, ""This is just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman."" But the main character is suddenly thrust into a world which he must learn quickly to manage. The canon takes a turn here toward incredible creativity. I avoid mainstream animation, but this has restored my faith.","

"matthewssilverhammer","21 December 2018","The worlds of superhero movies and superhero comics are not as similar as they seem on the surface. Currently, film studios are all about the ""extended universe"", seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise (Avengers, X-Men, Justice League), making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. Comics have this as well, of course. However, they also have something modern movies haven't really tapped into yet: story one-offs, a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. Spider-Verse gets to do just that, while playfully taking on the fun (if convoluted) absurdity of extended superhero universes.
Listen, I hear you. ""How could we possibly need another Spider-Man movie?"" Spider-Verse understands that question and has a take on it. Yes, Peter Parker is here. In fact, there are two Peter Parkers. There's also a Spider-Woman, a Noir Spider-Man, an anime Spider-Girl/Robot, and a Spider-Pig. At the center though is Miles Morales, an Afro-Hispanic Brooklyn teen who must help these other Spider-People get back to their own planes of existence. He fights with his cop dad, he adores his shady uncle, hates being simply the smartest kid in the room, and just wants to do something that matters. Being Spider-Man wasn't his idea, but hey, when a radioactive spider gives you powers, what choice do you have?
Look, I don't have any sort of hot take on this movie. It looks great, the humor pops with surprises, the voice casting is beyond perfect. It's simply a stylishly exciting and refreshingly unique take on the superhero genre, and sometimes that's more than enough.","

"eaglescout910","17 December 2018","A movie worthy of Stan Lee's approval. Incredible animation, great story, great message. This film lives up to the hype and honestly surpassed my expectations. The only reason I think there are some negative reviews is because you can never please everyone. However, for the vast majority of viewers, I believe you'll find this film to be great. Highly recommend seeing it in theaters just for the amazing animation style.","

"cafesmitty","21 December 2018","Have you ever sat through a film and you knew that films would never be the same going forward? For example, Terminator 2, Star Wars.. the first Toy Story... Iron ManWell this is one of those. This is a almost rather perfect film. Let me just say the the stylished animation is just top notch. It as if the comic book leaped off the pages. I've seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.And the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.Plus our the villains are so well done..But I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.It's been awhile I seen something so unexpected and so cool.","

"BandSAboutMovies","26 December 2018","The thing I hate about superhero movies is the origin story. After a multitude of Spider-Man stories, do we really need another retelling of his origin? That's the first - of many - things that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse does right. Much like how Grant Morrison retold Superman's beginnings in one page in All-Star Superman, this movie tells you everything you need to know within one minute and goes right into the action. It expects you to know the expected, but then once it makes you feel comfortable, it tears the rug out from under you.Here's the low down for those of you that don't read comics: there's more than one reality and more than one version of Spider-Man, who may not always be a man. Written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who left Solo due to creative differences, this movie is pure joy from start to finish. If you know and love the characters, it's so amazing to see them treated properly on the big screen. And if you don't, it's so much fun to meet all new versions of a character you already love.Beyond the Spidey you know and love, there's Miles Morales, a gifted teen who struggles to fit into a new school. He loves Spider-Man, is often at odds with his parents and looks up to his uncle Aaron. While working on graffiti, he's bit by a radioactive spider and suddenly has the same abilities as his hero.After a tragic incident when the real Spidey battles the Kingpin as that baddy tries to uses a particle accelerator to bring back his lost wife and son, Miles must take on the mantle of a hero while working alongside the Spiders of other dimensions: Spider-Gwen, Spider-Man Noir, Peter Porker the Spectacular Spider-Ham, and Peni Parker and SP//dr.The voice talent in this movie is absolutely amazing: Lily Tomlin is the best Aunt May ever, Nicholas Cage steals the show as Spider-Man Noir, who is from a world where it's always black and white and smells like rain and it was great to hear comedian John Mulaney as Spider-Ham.There's so much of this movie that perfectly translates the language of comics in a way that few films have succeeded in accomplishing. Ang Lee's The Hulk came close, but the animated styles of this film are constantly moving and even more alive than real action.It's also the first time I've seen a teenage world in a superhero movie that feels vibrant and now. Nothing feels fake, phony or forced about the school scenes. And the music is just as powerful as the film.Of all the Stan Lee cameos in the Marvel films, the one here feels the most organic and perfect. It brought a tear to my eye when he sold Miles the costume and told him that all the costumes eventually fit. Kudos to the producers for remembering both Lee and Steve Ditko at the film's end.In case you didn't pick it up, I give this movie my highest recommendation. While Infinity War may be the best Marvel movie ever, you need to have seen every single Marvel movie ever to get that. This is the kind of film that Becca could watch and enjoy without needing to open a single comic, which is just how she likes it. It's not only the best animated movie I've seen this year, it may be the best movie overall.","

"soulsplosion","20 December 2018","There's hardly anything I would improve about this film. The visuals, concepts, soundtrack, characters, pace, humor and animation are all some of the best I've ever seen in any film; I was worried the hype would ruin it for me, as it always does, but not even the group of kids in the theater who wouldn't stop loudly talking could ruin it for me. It is visually engaging and beautiful in every scene, not to mention with an incredibly unique art style, and is honestly something other animated movies should have to look up to for a long time. The only real issue I can think of is the flashing lights, which really alienates any epileptic audience, but even then it's done so in a beautiful and artful way.","

"rannynm","12 December 2018","What would you do if you could be a superhero? What if you have no choice? From the very beginning, Spider-Man: Into the Spicer-Verse is very energetic and captures your attention. This animated film has impressive visuals. The music creates a fantastic rhythm. And you just want to watch more.The story follows a high school student named Miles Morales, who just changed school. He goes into an abandoned subway station with his uncle Erin and gets bitten by a radioactive spider. Ever since that day, Miles starts sticking to everything he touches. Then, he meets Spider-Man (Peter Parker), teams up with some friends from the same dimension and they attempt to save the world from the villain Kingoin.The story is very original and makes the impossible possible. It takes all the abilities of Spider-Man to far and beyond with its action scenes. The film also shows a very real family atmosphere and the humor is smart. I love the non-traditional characters and how they embrace diversity. And yes! Spider-Man is Latino and surely does speak Spanish! There are also some fun new characters.With this film, Marvel has created a film that celebrates comics, film and visual arts. Of course, it celebrates Spider-Man and makes this super hero relevant and contemporary. It is absolutely eye-poppingly beautiful and really pushes the boundaries of the genre with its colors, textures and camera movements. There are several different forms of animation in one film. You feel as if you are actually reading a comic book or the comic book is coming to life.Naturally, the film does a very touching tribute to genius Stan Lee. I feel the filmmakers took some risks bringing new ideas to this iconic character which as been adored for over 50 years. The result is a must-see family movie that is even more appealing to new generations. I also love how this film is animated. It's so different. I've never seen a film like this one. I think it's very unique. Be sure to stay after the credits to see something very special, including another set of credits at the very end.This film sets a new era in animated movies. I recommend it for ages 5 to 18, as well as adults. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and include it in my Oscar predictions as a very possible winner. This is the film parents will love their kids to watch and kids will enjoy in many different ways.With great power comes great responsibility and we all can be heroes. This is the idea behind Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - inclusion for all in the vast universe and the idea that we can all be heroes by making the right choices and doing our best helping each other in our everyday life.Reviewed by Zoe C., KIDS FIRST!

"thinslicing","21 December 2018","Updated review 4-9-19I've now watched this movie 10 times since getting it on digital and then Blu-ray and can safely say this is a rare, near perfect movie. This is of course my opinion and I understand why this movie isn't for everyone. Let's break down a few of the reasons why for each of these points.If we had a list of everything that can be done to make a near perfect movie, this movie checks every box. The visuals have been talked about endlessly. It won an Oscar for them. We know they're great.The story is great, giving us a new Spider-Man with his own skills and personality that he brings to the table. The script is tight and the production is executed with laser precision.The voice acting is nothing short of top notch. This is easily the second best thing about this movie right behind the glorious visuals.Shamiek Moore has quickly grown on me over the ten times I've watched this movie. His range is as good as any veteran actor and he injects so much life into Miles Morales. He IS Miles Morales.Chris Pine did not phone in the short amount of lines he had whatsoever. Just superb casting because he and Jake Johnson sound pretty similar. And oh boy, Jake Johnson.I never understood why JJ had gotten so wildly popular over the last several years. With this movie I finally understand. I get it. It clicked. From the moment he pops up in this movie around the 20 minute mark till the end, Jake turns in one of the voice acting performances perhaps of all time. He succeeds in bringing a past his prime Peter Parker to life and runs the gamut of dramatic, sincere, intense, but above all FUNNY. Every single comedic line never fails to make me laugh out loud. Many of the gags pop into my head while I'm working or doing something else and I'll chuckle and repeat the line to myself.I've always enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld and she shines in this movie along with all the supporting cast.The greatest thing about this movie also happens to be its weakness. For me, the visuals are second to none. Another review title summed it up perfectly. ""The most visually stunning movie I've ever seen"". Absolutely agree. And while it takes a little time - usually 10-15 minutes - for your eyes to adjust to the frame rate, some people apparently can not adjust to this. I can imagine how poor that viewing experience would be, too bad really. Another thing is since they didn't use actual motion blur, but instead chose to animate blur-like artifacts and tricks to make it seem like blur, or having images doubled and overlapped for a ghosting effect, it confuses some people into thinking they're seeing the 2 images of the 3D version without the glasses. And lastly, the sheer intensity of some of the rapid action sequences combined with visual aesthetic pushed just beyond the breaking point and then dialed ever so slightly back by the direction team, it's just simply too much for some people. I get that.As far as continuity/plot holes and things of that nature, I think the movie could actually stand to be about 15-20 minutes longer. There really aren't many issues though so maybe this is just me being greedy for more visuals.Original review: Sure, we can dissect and critique and praise using any number of words we choose, but in the end to actually appreciate truly great art, it simply must be experienced in the medium in which it was created. For this movie, it was lovingly crafted in 3D, and so in my opinion can only be fully realized by the viewer in 3D.What is a comic book movie, and what makes it great? From the original Superman where we first saw a comic book hero fly, to Burton's dark and stylized Batman, to the graphic novel style Sin City, live action ensemble X-MEN, Spider-Man, Iron-Man, The Dark Knight, the entire MCU....all of these are comic book movies, and depending on your personal definition probably range from good to great. And they're all live action with varying degrees of special effects, and some with animation. If you had to pick ones that 'feel the most like a comic book', you'd probably pick Sin City for the overall look, and the phase 3 MCU films for a combination of visuals and capturing the tone and spirit of the comic book story arcs.But they aren't literally animated comics. The closest to that would probably be the animated movies, right? Like Mask of the Phantasm or any number of the Marvel animated movies. But again those are really 'just cartoons', and I don't mean that in a bad way. They're simply cartoon versions of comic books.Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is quite literally an animated comic book, and yet it is so much more at the same time. It's an explosion of comic book ink and paper, a dizzying palette of superbly rich colors, a jaw dropping display of digital artistry melded with living, breathing characters we care about, a story that is perfectly derived from the very medium in which it is being created and yet not for one single moment ever feels forced or hollow, a soundtrack fused with an endless exploration of a massive city, staggeringly sized scientific chambers, gigantic forests, and neon-electric-digital-dreamscapes of action set pieces that whir and click and come to life exactly as they do in the minds of children reading them on paper.This movie is breathtakingly good in every aspect. Like-I'm-questioning-my-sanity-is-it-really-as-good-as-I-think-it-is!?!? Yes. Yes yes yes.Remember the old Sega game Comix Zone? And how it was like ""oh wow! It's a comic book come to life!""? This is like that, with modern technology, cranked up a thousand times.But here's the most important part - *it was all done in the right way, by the right people, at the right time*. It feels like this project was greenlit and handed to the very people who created comic books themselves with a ""here ya go, you have full creative control. Oh and by the way you have an unlimited budget! And resources! Have as much fun making a great movie as you possibly can!""My first job was working in a movie theater. I took full advantage of being able to see free movies. I've built a decent surround sound system with all the creature comforts and have a growing library of movies. From the re-release of the original Star Wars trilogy, to each of the prequels and to the ongoing trilogy today, T-2, Titanic, the original X-Men, Avatar, The Dark Knight, Avengers, Avengers: Infinity War and so many more...I've gone to many, many big movie theater events for the experience. And I can safely say hands down that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 3D is the best moviegoing experience I have ever had. It's that great.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","4 July 2023","Even if you're not the biggest fan on Earth of animation, I'd urge you to give this film a try. It has such an incredibly broad appeal, it really does push the boundaries, and perhaps at the point in time that it was made, raise the bar on animation.The story is great, and Shameik Moore does a cracking job as the central hero, but the deal success comes with the animation, it is quite remarkably good, with subsequent viewings you'll spot more and more, it was clearly a labour of love for the team behind it.It is a dazzling, dizzying affair, there is so much happening on, but it's all cohesive, it's not one of those films that leaves you confused and bewildered, it really does come together nicely.Plenty of action, plenty of surprises, I urge you to watch it, and then definitely get and see the mind-blowing follow up.9/10.","

"vancewinstead","15 December 2018","This movie was absolutely incredible. From the animation, to the storytelling, to the characters this movie is completely one of a kind. It is easily the best looking animated movie of the year (no surprise there), but what really caught me off guard was the story they were able to tell in such a short amount of time. Each character has their own distinct personality and is given their own separate characterization without making the movie feel bloated. I knew I would end up liking this movie, but this movie has completely exceeded my expectations. If you enjoy superheros or animation you should 100% definitely watch it in a theater.","

"FairlyAnonymous","4 January 2019","As much as I enjoy this movie (and as an animator/storyartist I love the visuals!) I have to honest and say it is a bit of an unfocused mess. The reason why you should see this movie is because it is the first in what will hopefully be a trend of innovative and creative animated movies that aren't just looking over the shoulders of what Disney and Pixar are doing. This movie is its own creature and I think it deserves to be seen just for the visuals and the opportunity to hopefully support this trend...However, I would only say that if the movie has some substance to it.... which it does. I recommend people see this movie, but it should be noted that I think this movie may be getting the ""Kubo"" treatment where an animated film is visually impressive to such a degree that people gloss over bad writing because everything they are looking at is so cool.The first half of this movie is brilliant. I think just about everything in the first half works really well and is super effective. Miles Morales felt like a real kid with some real kid issues, Peter B Parker was funny, tragic and fleshed out, and Gwen... existed (we'll get to her later). My eyes were glued to the screen and I was excited for where the story would go as I was genuinely surprised at a couple twists and turns in the story.Then, a certain moment happened in the movie where I was taken out of the film and went, ""Wait... oh shoot this is going downhill real fast."" It was the introduction of all of the other spider-verse characters. At that moment the film shifted gears into an entirely different film from the first half. Does Miles Morales fit in with the professionals? Can Miles Morales impress them? Everyone seems to hate him due to his lack of experience! Can Miles Morales take a leap of faith (which he already did in the beginning of the movie)??!?! Is Miles Morales even relevant to the story?!?!?!?! All of these sudden new themes and plot developments completely derail what the first half of the film was setting up to such a degree that it felt like a giant schism cut through the film and the second half of the film was waving goodbye to the first half.I'll be clear that I have no issue with other spider-verse characters sharing screen-time in the film, the issue is that they don't add much in terms of character development or interaction with Miles. The characters should serve to help Miles grow, but in this movie they just seem like another pair of fists to punch bad guys, and there is no better example of this than...Gwen Stacey.Gwen Stacey has the unfortunate issue of being completely irrelevant to the story when she should be an important and vital character to Peter B Parker's/Miles Morales' character growth and should have an arc of her own. This is a character who witnessed Peter Parker (her best friend) die and Peter B Parker is someone who witnessed Gwen Stacey die in her universe! WHY DON'T THEY DISCUSS THIS!!! Peter B Parker should be surprised and excited to see someone he knew as dead alive again and she should be happy to see her best friend once more! Instead, the two characters just... punch bad guys... like everyone else. No growth or development between the two.To make matters worse, Gwen doesn't even really work to help Miles Morales develop as a character. In the beginning of the film she is built up to be one of the main characters, but in the second half she doesn't develop any further than she did in the beginning. She experiences no character growth nor does she help develop any other characters. She just exists in the film.I could go on for a while about all of the different weird pacing issues in the second half of the film such as Miles Morales suddenly getting super powerful and skilled out of nowhere (it's odd that people complain about ""Mary Sues"" in film but don't complain about Miles Morales going from zero to hero in one scene), or a single cut from a comedy scene to a tragic ""friends splitting up"" scene, some loose character threads such as Miles' dad telling cops to chase spider-man but we never see them do it, and many other instances of odd pacing choices and poor juxtapositions of emotional story beats.But, I will end this on a positive note: All of the characters are enjoyable when they get their moment and I think the writing on the father was really good. He wasn't your typical ""larger than life"" father but a very honest, strong, but stubborn dad who has his flaws yet is very likable and reasonable. I wish him and Uncle Aaron had some scenes together and their dynamic was a bit more fleshed out, but as is I still like them regardless of the additional scenes they deserved.Go see it if you want to support innovative and risky animation, but be warned that it is not a perfect film (other than visually).","

"bob the moo","22 September 2019","There was a lot of hype about this film, which surprised me because when I first glanced at the trailer I just dismissed what I saw as a direct-to-TV film. The hype gave me pause but at the same time made me wait so that it had time to settle into reality. Coming to it outside of the hype and awards, I was open to what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. What pleased me was how creative it was in several areas of production. In terms of narrative it took the risk to be silly with its alternative Spider-Men, but was able to balance that with an engaging and reasonably serious core narrative. It managed to be funny, fun, engaging, and enjoyable all the way through.Animation wise it mixed many styles and approaches very well. Even when it felt OTT with the visuals, it still somehow worked and I didn't feel beaten down or tired as sometimes can happen with visual overload. The overall design of the film added to this, with good use of music, shot framing, and animation to make it feel very cool and fluid throughout. Production-wise, it felt like it ""got"" the sense of humour of the script and made that work more than it otherwise would have done. Voice performances also seem to get this, and everyone plays their characters well.Overall, it is creative, funny, engaging, and exciting for those that get into it and accept it on its own terms.","

"mahmus","21 December 2018","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one of the most beautiful animated movies I've seen and possibly the best looking superhero movie of all time; with its bright neon colors combined with its comic book asthetic, it creates a world unlike anything I've seen since the LEGO Movie.
The characters are all great. Miles Morales is a fantastic protagonist; understandably scared at the prospect of being Spider-Man, but excited to learn. His relationship with his father and Peter Parker are some of the most emotiinal scenes in the movie. Gwen Stacy is also a great supporting character, as are thr rest of the spider people.
The villains are fun and the action is jaw dropping.
It's also tear jerking tribute to Stan Lee.
This is the best Spider-Man movie by far.","

"Anurag-Shetty","16 December 2018","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse tells the story of Miles Morales(Shameik Moore). When Miles becomes the Spider-Man of his universe, he meets various versions of the wall-crawler from parallel universes. Now, all the Spideys must team up to put an end to a danger, that could alter reality in terrible ways.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a mind-blowing film. Directors Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman & writer Phil Lord, have given us the best big screen adaptation of Spider-Man & that's saying something. I love the fact that this movie, makes us feel nostalgic about the previous big screen adaptations of Spider-Man. The animation is awe-inspiring. The comic book format of the animation is unique & is perfect for one of the most loved comic book characters. The 3D is amazing(watch this film on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX). The action set pieces, the humour & the emotional scenes are perfectly balanced, throughout. The voice-over work is unforgettable. Shameik Moore is spectacular as Miles Morales. Moore brings that much needed vulnerability to his character. Jake Johnson is outstanding as Peter B. Parker. Hailee Steinfeld is brilliant as Gwen Stacy. Mahershala Ali is perfect as Uncle Aaron. Brian Tyree Henry is excellent as Jefferson Davis. John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn & Nicolas Cage are awesome as Spider-Ham, Peni Parker & Spider-Man Noir, respectively. Kathryn Hahn & Liev Schreiber are superb as Doc Ock & Wilson Fisk, respectively. Lily Tomlin, Luna Lauren Velez, Zoe Kravitz & Chris Pine are great as Aunt May, Rio Morales, Mary Jane & Peter Parker, respectively. Everything about Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is jaw-dropping! A must watch. Swing by your nearest multiplex, immediately!","

"chriscarlisle25","15 December 2018","I knew that this movie would be good from the first moment I heard about it last year, and it did not disappoint me one bit. It met all of my expectations, and then went above and beyond them. The animation is a blend of CGI, stop animation, pop/comic book art and realism. The vibrant colors pop out at you, and the action sequences really enthrall. A very captivating and beautiful piece of art is this movie, and the writing choices leave nothing to be desired. The story is that of the traditional starting superhero with a bunch of twists thrown in. The movie itself actually follows past comics for the most part, with some minor changes here and there. A true Spider-Man, or comic book fan in general, will not have anything to criticize in this movie. Everything that fans want to see out of Spidey(s) is in this movie. There are multiple different variations of Spider-Man in the film, and all of them have their special moments to shine. The end credit scene just rockets this movie up past my already positive expectations, and it gets a 10/10 from me! The movie can be enjoyed by both young and old alike, and trust me, it will blow your mind! Best animated film of 2018, and one of the best superhero movies ever made. It deserves any and all awards and kudos it will surely garner.","

"educallejero","25 February 2019","The movie is visually spectacular (with the exceptions of a handful of blurry scenes filled with blues and reds, maybe for 3D purposes?). The colours and character designs are gorgeous. The dynamics of the action and the camera work is superb. All of this is ""all time great"" level.But... The story is ultra basic, therefore quite boring for about 45 impossibly predictable minutes. The jokes, while clever for a movie for kids, just didn't make me laugh. Not even one time. I'm not sure why. Also, the story lacks all kinds of depths. It's literally no sense, but I don't think is the focus of the movie, because...What really works is the theme of the film. Everybody can ""wear the mask"". And they proved it by showing it, not depending on melodramatic and cliched monologues, but with the story itself, that included different versions of totally different people ""wearing the masks"".The emotional bits also work well and kind of justify the boring preparation for it, developing Miles Morales origin story and his family and problems really well. Simple, but well done.
For last, the villains and its plans are just almost pointless and beyond under developed. There was probably no enough time to give them better and more coherent plans.
A good movie, visually superior with a well done and coherent message that actually works in the story (sometimes these superhero movies contradict themselves and they are about the ""problem with violence""... by using violence to solve the problem. No here. Spiderman is not white, black, female, old or young. It can be anybody. And they are good).","

"jackgdemoss","17 December 2018","This film was phenomenal for so many reasons. First and most importantly, it was the most visually impressive film I have seen to this day. The animation style alone had such a mystical and wonderous quality to it. The animators didn't stop there, however. They added so many little fun details that made me feel like I was watching some sort of blend between comic and movie. In addition to the gorgeous visual nature of Spider-Man, I was impressed by both the humor and the meta references. The reference to the cringey Spider-Man 3 scene and the post-credits meme reference were my personal favorites. There were tons of little details that I am sure I never truly appreciated because I have never been a consumer of comic books, but I have to imagine that this film is even more special to Marvel comic fans. The only gripe that I have with Spider-Man is that it failed to keep my attention in act 3. It was longer than it should have been, and it would have benefited greatly by cutting down 10 minutes. With that being said, this is the best movie I have seen in a few months and I hope that my review reaches someone who was not going to see it and urges them to reconsider.","

"kjproulx","11 December 2018","Growing up, I grew an appreciation for the character of Spider-Man that I've never been able to develop for any other comic book character. It was Sam Raimi's original live-action trilogy that hooked me and had me scrounging for more. Watching countless episodes of every cartoon iteration, and even starting to read a few of the comics, I found myself becoming a huge fan of this generational icon. Once Spider-Man 3 hit theatres, the character had lost all hope on the big screen, until Andrew Garfield took the role from Tobey Maguire, which didn't last too long, and also crashed and burned. Finally, he found his footing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, played by Tom Holland, but none of that matters when watching Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Not only is this the best that this character has been in a while, but I believe there's a real argument to made that this is possibly the greatest feature-length film based on this character, period.In this film, which is loosely based off of storylines that are very similar to how this movie plays out, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse follows Miles Morales as he's bitten by a radioactive spider and develops the same (and more) powers as his hero, Spider-Man. After an event opens a portal, it's revealed that his universe isn't the only one. There are endless dimensions out there with parallel characters and creatures, all with similar backstories. From Spider-Gwen to Spider-Ham, this film explores the classics as well as the bizarre, which I fear will probably turn off some average moviegoers who haven't experienced these characters yet, but if you can't embrace a film like that, it's probably not for you anyways.From the very first teaser trailer, I was very intrigued by the look of this film and how different it looked from most animated films out there today. With only a couple of notable films in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Arthur Christmas, Sony Pictures hasn't had the best track record in terms of releasing animated movies theatrically. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has given new life to that notion, because this isn't only the best they've ever produced in my opinion, but it's the best animated movie that has come out all year. The unique style leaps off the screen and made me find another layer to love, on top of the fantastic storyline and characters surrounding it.Yes, the origin story of Peter Parker is the one that everyone knows. That is very much present here again, and nearly every one of these characters share similar backgrounds, but it feels as though the filmmakers expect the audience to be in on the joke of that. This movie is very meta at times, and it works very well if you're invested in the movie as a whole. At the emotional core of this movie is how these characters differ from one another and how certain circumstances can be worse than others. There are some fantastic life lessons to be learned by children here, and for that, I only loved this movie even more.In the end, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse impressed me on many levels. It gives you the Spider-Man action that you've come to expect from this character, as well as giving new life to it. The character of Miles Morales has just as many layers to his story as the classic Peter Parker one, but the inclusion of each one of the side characters here fleshes him out even more. This is one of the best superhero origin stories I've seen on the big screen in years. Filled with heart, emotion, plenty of action, and eye-candy as far as the eye can see, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one of my favourite films of the year.","

"TheMovieDoctorful","18 December 2018","I've waited 4 years to love Spider-Man this much. From comics to movies to video games, the last Spider-Man related story that I truly loved was the divisive Marc Webb movie, The Amazing Spider-Man 2. However, 2018 has really turned things around for my favorite Marvel superhero; from his groundbreaking video game for the PS4 to the brilliant Nick Spencer taking the reigns from the incompetent Dan Slott in the comics. Hell, even the MCU's depiction of Spider-Man (Which I despised in both Civil War and Homecoming) was surprisingly enjoyable in Infinity War, despite my thoughts on the rest of the film. The resurgence in quality Spider-Man stories continues with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse; perhaps the best superhero film since 2004's Spider-Man 2.The voice cast couldn't have been better. I've been saying how Shameik Moore would make a perfect Miles Morales ever since I saw him in Dope and he doesn't disappoint here. Much like Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn or J.K Simmons J.J Jameson, Shameik Moore IS Miles Morales as far as I'm concerned. He nails Morales ambition, his selflessness, his emotional vulnerability and his overall shyness in one of my favorite comic book movie performances ever. You could not have picked a better actor for this role.Jake Johnson as an older, more broken (But still witty) Spider-Man who's lost his way was unexpected, but really interesting. Johnson is funny and charismatic, but has a real emotional pathos to him that takes his performance to the next level. He may actually be my favorite cinematic acting performance for Peter Parker He's a surprisingly complex character for a more family-targeted Spider-Man film and Johnson handles Parker's ascent from washed up has-been to the Spidey we all know and love wonderfully.Nicolas Cage as Spider-Man Noir is a joy to listen to whenever he's on screen. His deliciously hammy New York accent firing off witty 1930s one liners is something never knew I needed so badly. I found myself smiling pretty much every time he spoke. It's a smaller role, but by God, Cage absolutely does his thing and it benefits this wacky, incredibly imaginative movie wonderfully.All of the characters here feel so real and human. Miles' strong sense of honor and commitment to the ideals of his role models make him such a likable and easy-to-root for lead. Long before Miles dons his iconic red & black hoodie costume from the comics, he fully embodies the selflessness, compassion and empathy that make Spider-Man such an inspirational and iconic character. I can totally understand why his kindness and capacity for good inspire Jake Johnson's Spider-Man to return to his heroic and altruistic ways he had long since abandoned. The film really does an excellent job of testing Miles' will power, the sincerity of his innate goodness, putting him through the ringer emotionally as he suffers insurmountable, but staggeringly human, losses. This is the kind of Spider-Man that I wanted to be when I grew up. The character journey that Peter Parker goes through here is easily the most nuanced and layered he's experienced in a movie. From the deadbeat loser we see in the first act, to the hopeless martyr of the second to our Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man we witness in the third, the sheer depth (And natural pace) of Spider-Man's development here is something I honestly never thought the screenwriting duo of Lord & Rothman were capable of. Even with villains and minor characters like Kingpin, Uncle Aaron and Miles' father Officer Davis are all characters whose hopes, dreams, fears and ambitions are all things I could easily describe.Much like Suicide Squad, the film makes the wise decision of using its vast and diverse gallery of characters to bring in a wondrous array of different visual styles. We have the urban graffiti style of Miles Morales, the 60s Marvel style of Peter Benjamin Parker, the Marvel Now! style of Spider-Gwen, the Golden Age comics style of Spider-Man: Noir, the Acme style of Spider-Ham and the anime style of Peni Parker. It's no secret that the film's core message is that anyone with a big spine and a bigger heart can be Spider-Man, but what makes Into the Spider-Verse so impressive is that, like the best comic books, it conveys this all visually. Every one of these different styles gets their own spot in the sunlight and I feel that every viewer will find a style here that really touches them on a personal level, just as each viewer is likely to find a Spider-Man here who they can relate too and resonate with emotionally. Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse isn't merely a great comic book movie, it's a comic book brought to life.I'll always have appreciation for soundtracks that really capture the musical tastes of a specific generation. They almost act as cultural time capsules of the time in which they were released. Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse very much fits this description, featuring some of the best and most atmospheric songs of Post Malone, Juice Wrld, Seezyn, XXTentacion, Swae Lee and Annuel AE's careers. I haven't loved a soundtrack to a comic book movie this much since Spawn. Just like that film, Into The Spider-Verse's soundtrack really captures the musical atmosphere of the late 2010s. It just set such an emotional tone for the film, one that's very much earned with this excellent and moving screenplay.Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse is easily the best superhero film of 2018 and its place as the 2nd best Marvel film to date is unlikely to be unseated by anything else. It's a must see for anyone with even a remote love for the character and it completely makes up for the terrible depictions of Spider-Man in both Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man: Homecoming. It's nice to see my faith (Or, relative faith over Marvel studios, at least) rewarded.","

"jeannefrancoise","15 December 2018","Dear Marvel fans, since I knew Spider Gwen is dubbed by my idol Hailee Steinfeld, I really wanted to watch this Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse movie. Then happily I did watch it and my review is just short: This movie is a fascinating graphic that please your eyes! Take a very big applause for artistic department and all team that make the idea of parallel universe could be combined with the original story of Spiderman. The identity, friendship, battles, family relations of Peter Parker became clear enough for the whole story of Spiderman series itself. How we ever knew about him, what is going on in his world, and when Spiderman transform himself to be a hero, is explained more here, and with the special appearances of Kingpin and his villain team, the director could lead the plots into the fun way for everybody. This is not just ordinary cartoon, but the highly qualified design graphic with the exact scenes, special effects, and bubble conversation like a moving comic-book. Every details in this animation is clearly edited by professional film-makers with any mistakes, nor any flaws. Even for Spiderman fans, this movie is so fresh to be watched and stays in his original starting point. No matter how many Spiderman movies could ever be made, this Spiderverse perhaps the first sci-fi animation I've ever watched and what a fascinating graphic to win Golden Globe very soon. And yes, I listen carefully of what Spider Gwen said because it is dubbed by my idol, Hailee Steinfeld, who will win many awards ahead. Thank you producer, director, casts, and crew to deliver this amazing movie to us.","

"tavm","10 January 2019","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and his adult nephew. We all were enthralled by the tale of the various Spider-Heroes depicted in this film especially the main one of Miles Morales. Some of the backgrounds looked like what a 3-D movie would look like without wearing the glasses which confused me to think I needed them but then the front scenes were clear so I then knew I didn't. Great visuals and story. Also, nice extended cameo by co-creator Stan Lee and touching since this was released after his passing. Nice of the credits sequence to also dedicate the movie in memory of him and other co-creator Steve Ditko. So that's a very high recommendation of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.","

"Zephrey","13 December 2018","I'm blown away, this movie is absolutely beautiful. The animation is stunning, the soundtrack is amazing and the dialogue and storyline is so heart-warming.
The characters are memorable, they all bring their own emotions rubbing off on the audience, and the humor is right on, its daring and hilarious and doesn't seem forced like you might see in some of the MCU films.
There's been 7 Spider-Man films in the last 16 years and this might be the best one yet, its pays its respect to the past films while driven on its own storyline adventure, being such a known character the movies still comes out as original.
The cinematography and animation are gorgeous, definitely oscar worthy. I'd say this is one of the best superhero origins movies ever made. Then there's the numerous amount of easter eggs, be on the lookout for those.
I can't say the movies underrated cause its be treated just as it should be, but if there's one thing that its underrated its the soundtrack, the funny thing is the soundtrack is the exact type of music Miles Morales would listen to, so I guess you could say there's a touch of realism.
In the end all I can see is go see this movie for yourselves, the visual experience is amazing, its touching and serious, funny and witty, brings more emotion than some of the superhero movies you'll see today and best of all if your sick of superhero movies this is a complete different and fresh start of the genre. (Don't forget to wait till the end of the credits)","

"Thekeybaldemasterrises","7 December 2018","Edit: I see a lot of people have already thumbed down this review because it sounds like people are playing the race card with this movie. ""Peter Parker is the only Spider-Man!!"" Look watch the movie for yourself, or don't see it at all. If you're really that bothered by a black Spider-Man in this movie then why are you here reading reviews? You still have the Rami films and heck you still have the Garfield films if that's what floats your boat. If you really care about good storytelling and good animation then hear me out.
Into the Spider-Verse is the hour of redemption for Sony's animation studio. I haven't been particularly happy with their recent films ranging from endless Hotel Transylvania sequels, constant remakes of the Smurfs, and of course the god awful Emoji Movie. I kept asking myself, when Sony? When will you actually use your creative talents and give us something worth our time? And folks, this is it. This is their baby. Into the Spider-Verse is not only one of the best animated films of the year, it's one of the best Spider-Man films period. I was skeptical at first too, the high ratings, the complex story, the studio, but thankfully the reviews were right on this. What this movie does so well is how it constantly engages its audience through visual storytelling. It reflects the same methods Stan Lee/Steve Ditko used when they wrote their comic stories all those years ago. You can tell the filmmakers did their homework and really captured the comic book esthetic to a whole other level. It's colorful, it's full of amazing textures, and the action is just amazing to watch. Now if the movie solely relied on this I probably would've given it a lower rating but thankfully they wrote a nice story here. We get to finally see Miles Morales come to life and while I didn't think he had the most interesting personality compared to say Peter Parker, he worked as a vessel for the audience. We got to see his Spider-Man journey in a very unique and interesting way that feels nostalgic but fresh at the same time. I do have to add that I didn't quite feel the emotional weight in this film with Miles' character arc like I did in Tobey's Spider-Man 2, but it was still emotionally satisfying for this film on its own when you don't compare it to previous films. In the end, this was still my favorite Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2. It's funny, fun, and full of heart. I would be ok with Sony owning the license to Spider-Man if they kept making movies with this animation style but still carry some depth and passion in the storytelling. Because this movie honored the most endearing thing about Spider-Man's story, and it's that anyone can wear the mask. It's that universal trait that Steve Ditko and Stan Lee created all those years ago that make this character so mythological and so palpable. And this has one of Stan's best cameos yet I promise you that. If you're a Spidey fan, or just a comic fan, or even just a fan of animated films. YESSS GO SEE IT. This is my favorite animated film of the year, if not in years, and might potentially creep into my top 10 films of the year. PLEASE GO SUPPORT THIS. 9/10.","

"DarkVulcan29","21 December 2018","The film is like a comic book come to life, I mean that's the look the filmmakers where looking for. Attempts to be two things at once, a Spider Man film and a sort of parody of a Spider Man film. It does have heart, and never goes to far into silliness. The animation is really amazing, takes the audience into this world. And I was wondering when we where gonna see the other Spider characters, and here we finally do and it was worth it.
I hope we more movies with the characters of Spider Gwen, Miles Morales, and Spider Man Noir to name a few. It has a great story, telling us about things in case we get stuck in sub plot. Now I it differs a little from the comic. But I expect a lot of times in comic book movies. Hope to see more Spider Verse movies in the future.","

"darthakam","21 December 2018","Heads-up: I'm only going to be talking about Peter Parker in this review. I'll make a separate one for the film laterm I just feel like he deserves his own review. That's how great Peter is in this film.Into The Spider-verse reminds us why we love Spiderman so much, and does so in an original and humane way.I used to love Spiderman as a kid. I got obssessed with the cartoons he starred in as well as the original movie trilogy, one that actually helped me get interested in the character and marvel as a whole. But my love for this character, as most things, dissolved and it never got around to build itself up again, even after constant remakes and wonderful performances. I never felt that spark again, that love I felt for this charming dude was gone, dead.Then Into The Spider-verse came, and my whole world turned upside down. I felt a fire inside my stomach. There it was, that long-forgotten love for Peter Parker, one that I thought I would never experience again, expanding continuously as the movie progressed, hitting me in all the right places.I'd even dare to say that this movie made me understand the reason as to why spider-man is universally loved:He's an everyday guy with super powers, that's it. He's flawed but pure at heart. He's relatable. He belongs to the people. He's one of us.This movie's fresh take on Peter Parker is exactly what we needed to fully grasp that, how compelling this character can be without using any of his super powers. This version of Peter Parker is fat, subtly depressed, and tired, yet he's the most charming and lovable version of this character yet. It's something we haven't seen in quite a while, the genuine humanity that makes Peter Parker such a charismatic character, and one can only be thankful for it.Spider-man is cool again, but in a totally different, and perhaps even better, way. Just your everyday dude taking a leap of faith, giving the audience who relates to his struggles courage to do the same. This is what Spiderman can be and what he should be. A character that's ours, a character that teaches you that anyone can be a hero, that's the real Spiderman. This is the true Homecoming. Spiderman is freaking back! Welcome home!","

Everything about this film, the beautiful animation, voice-acting, character development, and music are top notch. You can tell that the people behind this movie actually care about Spider-Man and care about their craft. From hilarious references to touching storytelling, this movie is just a joy to watch. It's such a unique addition to the genre and indicates that as long as talented people are involved in making these films, the superhero genre will continue to reinvent itself.","

"ninjaboyballer","19 December 2018","I gotta day I thought this movie was going to suck because of that awful emoji movie by Sony. Boy was I wrong. This probably my favorite spider man movie. It as great characters, great comic book action, great emotional moments, great animation. I also liked in some particular scenes they were down for using violence. In the movie a character gets crushed and another one gets shot. Although it didn't actually show any blood or anything, it's still a bit over the top for a PG movie. But I'm glad they had the balls to do that. It also feels like your watching an actual comic book. Like they have those sound effects like when spider man thwips his webs and when characters punch and kick each other and explosions go off. It feels like a panel of a comic come to life. I also like how they make peter and Gwen's backstories hilariously sad. This is actually a pretty funny movie. I was suprised that this movie was funny. I also like they have journeys for the two main characters that are wrapped up by the end of the film. This film also shows how the character of spider man is so inspirational and important. How he matters not just to the marvel universe but how he relates to people who read his stories. And the post credits scene is probably my favorite of this year. Wait till the end to see it. I pretty much loved everything about this movie except probably Kingpin. He was underdeveloped a lot and I wish he was given more to do. Overall though, Spider man into the spider verse is a blast of a film and I am going to give it a 9.7/10","

If you are not really familiar with spiderman, other than the movies and MCU, like me, are you gonna like it? Well.. I certainly did!This was amazing on almost ever level! There was a great story and character arc about accepting the responsebility, not having to do everything yourself and that failure comes with the job! I got quite emotional a couple of times! I enjoyed the characters and villains as well! They have motives we can understand!However.. despite all that, the most groundbreaking part of this movie, has to be... the animation! This movie looks absolutely amazing with some out of this world shots! The style reminded me of Arcane at times! It seriously looks so damn good and they pull no punches in terms of creativity!

"OnjiMooteDaMarle","15 March 2019","It started of well and I knew by the trailer what I was going to expect. I was waiting for something beyond my expectation but when it became weirder it definitely became a lot weirder. If you have seen episodes of The Flash, this film's story feels like meh. Apart from the dialogues, it's definitely bad writing. The main character is completely clueless about being spider-man but when the writers need him to use his skills, voila!, he knows it all, like the back of his hand.People who say this is the most visually stunning film they have ever seen are those who haven't seen films. All those who have given this a rating standing at 8 point something have been blown over the visuals of this film which is great but every film's basic foot lies in it's screenplay. This is sloppy writing. Aunt May being kind of Iron Man and all. There is a moment in every new super hero film where the hero falls short of confidence and then a few scenes or a lot of scenes later the confidence is regained. Here it happens in the very next scene. What a load of BS. Spider-man sticky web sticks to his hand easily and is a disturbance for him but it is conveniently easy for the villain to break that sticky webAnd Nicoles Cage..Are you kidding me...His way of talking makes it irritatingly meme funny. Depressing. His character was a complete waste.But definitely much better than Captain Marvel.
This film is visually stunning and the animation is excellent. Kudos to the animation artists. But the writers need to write better.","

"classicsoncall","2 January 2019","Uh-oh, I feel a 'here I go again' coming. As I write this, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is ranked #29 on IMDb's list of Top 250 movies of all time, right there in between ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Léon: The Professional"". Among the eighty plus comic-book based super-hero movies I've seen and reviewed, it comes in at #2, right behind ""The Dark Knight"", which means viewers give it a higher rating than ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", if any of you Marvel fans care about that. I don't know, I just think there's just something askew about that, instinctively telling me that in this case, it's not the quality of the movie that places it so high in the rankings, but the overall popularity and buzz that attaches itself to the film. But enough of that.I actually thought the film was OK, not great, but OK. As far as animated movies go, I thought it was exceptionally rendered with bright, vivid colors and an interesting cast of characters, some of whom I was familiar with and others not. I actually do remember Spider-Ham from the dark recesses of my memory long ago. As far as the story line goes, it wasn't particularly new or innovative, how many threats to reality have you encountered over the course of your movie viewing lives? If it sounds like I'm trashing the flick, I'm not really, I think it's great for kids and fans of animated movies. Speaking of which, and relative to my argument above, the picture is outranked by the Japanese anime ""Spirited Away"" on the current Top 250 at Number #27, so I'm not bashing the picture for not being live action.My biggest kick out of watching the movie, and I make this statement a lot about Marvel based comic book movies, was seeing writer and artist Stan Lee drawn into the film as a store clerk named appropriately enough, 'Stan'. With his recent passing at the age of ninety five, it saddens me to know that I won't be seeing him in those ubiquitous cameo spots that I always look for in a Marvel super-hero film. As one of the original creators of Spider-Man along with Steve Ditko (who also passed away in 2018), I'd like to think that Stan Lee got his own special preview showing of ""Into the Spider-Verse"" before he entered Valhalla. He is one that will be missed.","

Kingpins latest dastardly scheme is tearing the fabrics of reality apart and alternate universe versions of Spiderman have all ended up in the same universe. I'm sure you can work out what happens next.So the animation style is a tweak on Pixar, it plays out like a comic book and call me weird but that certainly didn't work for me. The animation doesn't flow fluidly, it looks hokey, disjointed and I found myself frustrated by it.The plot is a novel concept and I liked it, the delivery however I did not. Certain aspects make very little sense, sure it's a Spiderman film so I'm not supposed to think about it too much but I did and my conclusions were migraine inducing stupidity. Did I say stupidity? Oh the stupid doesn't end there sadly, I get the multiverse concept of anything is possible but their Spiderman variant choices were bafflingly dumb and what you'd expect from a Saturday morning cartoon not a blockbuster film!It tries to be heartfelt, but comes across half-assed.
It tries to be funny, but comes across childish.
It tries to be action packed but the style of animation didn't allow it to be done justice.Okay I'm slating the film right now so it probably sounds like I hated it, which I didn't. 6/10 is a fair rating and suggests its above average and it is. But I'm annoyed at the acclaim that's it's been bathed in.8.6 rating on IMDB are you kidding me? And the Oscars have lacked credibility in my eyes for years because of their ridiculous bias and genre-snubbing but this right here is the last bit of credibility up in smoke. I'm not saying a superhero movie shouldn't be Oscar worthy, but this silly cartoon simply isn't (And neither is Black Panther but I'll resist the urge to rant).Into the Spider-Verse to me is no different than all the straight to DVD Marvel and DC efforts we see a couple of each year. The only difference here is the animation style, nothing else sets it apart.I just don't get the appeal.The Good:Some great writingGreat ideaThe Bad:Animation hardly flowsUnexpectedly sillyPlot holes that are unforgivably stupid","

"andrewroy-04316","6 April 2019","I think this one is mostly ""on me"", as someone who never read comic books growing up and enjoys the ideas that movies leave me with, not the visual experience as much. Spider-Verse is undeniably creative and unique, particularly in its animation, which I think is the best I've ever seen, and the premise is a self-aware and original breath of fresh air in the superhero genre. The voice acting is good, and the comedy is pretty good (though I found the jokes revolving around Miles being young and being goofy in learning his powers to be trite and overplayed). While I was ready to love it, many plot points left me scratching my head and there was no sense of any real stakes. Among the frustrating plot points to me were the absurdity of the 3 new spider people, especially Porky (why? How does that make any sense?); the uncle coincidentally being the person working for Kingpin and tasked with chasing down Spider-Man; Kingpin's backstory scene, where we are following Miles escaping and out of nowhere cut to a memory of Kingpin's family dying after having no background on him at all, just felt very out of place and poorly edited; and other minor points. The story was quite predictable and followed a rote story arc, which contributed significantly to the sense that the outcome was never in doubt, keeping my emotional investment and engagement low throughout. In classic deus ex machina form, Miles struggled and gradually is improving in using his powers, and then right after his dad talks to him he magically has complete control and can win all the fights, is a beast out of nowhere? It had done such a good job of showing his struggles in being valued and succeeding in his tasks, so the flipped switch of him effortlessly and suddenly being powerful was a disservice to the rest of the movie. Thematically, it didn't feel like anything unique, as a standard coming of age story and with a message that anyone can be a superhero. It pays obvious and honest homage to the comic book form, more genuinely adapting the style than any movie I've seen before. It did many things really well, but the various plot point frustrations and the lack of emotional investment due to the lack of stakes made it a forgettable, if pleasant, movie experience for me. I certainly recommend it to others, as at minimum you'll get a fun, amusing and visually gorgeous movie and if you like the comic book style, it could be an all time great.","

"sweidman-28016","15 December 2018","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse Review:Into the Spider-Verse is a new Sony animated movie about Miles Morales, a Spider-Man, who discovers multiple versions of Spider-Man from different dimensions after an experiment gone wrong. I absolutely love Spider-Man. He is my favorite character of all time so I was super excited for this. I loved Into the Spider-Verse! Everything was definitely thought through very carefully, taking into consideration all the comics and backstories for each character. The story was amazing. It was trippy and just fantastic. It wasn't really predictable for the most part which is really good. The voice acting was really good. Shameik Moore as Miles was by far the best part. His emotion was really good and you could feel for him like you knew Miles. Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker was really good. I thought that Spider-Man was funny and just enjoyable. Mahershala Ali as Uncle Aaron was very good. Mahershala is just a really good actor and if was cool to hear him voice acting. Brian Tyree Henry player Jefferson Davis and he was a great voice actor for Miles's father. All the characters had great development. There were three Spider-Men that came later on that I really liked but didn't have too much exposition on them, but it made sense for them not to have to much. Throughout the film when we meet all the Spider-Men they do exposition on them and they do it in a comedic way and for those three they didn't need to go too deep so it worked. Also the villain of the story, King Pin, had a great design and looked like a good villain but he kind of failed a little. I could see his views after his backstory was revealed but I wanted just a little more out of him. This film had some of the best animation I've ever seen. They made it like a comic book and it looked beautiful. Also the movie is a bit trippy so some of the scenes were just beautiful looking. I could talk about this movie for a long while but I don't want to get into spoilers. If you love Marvel and Spider-Man there is no way to be disappointed. I would recommend it for sure. It'll be nominated for Best Animated Feature for the Oscars (it was nominated for the Golden Globes). It's now hard to say if this or Incredibles 2 will win. This movie has higher ratings but Incredibles 2 is Disney and they almost always win. Once again see it! I absolutely loved Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse!!!My Grade: A","

"ThunderKing6","14 December 2018","What a superb Movie.In coming into this movie I was blank. I know much about Spiderman but I don't know enough. Not sure if any of this movie is accurate or not although this movie was really good.This movie is about Miles becoming a new Spiderman, adapting to his ability and trying to get the other Spidermen back to their universes.The animation was only a problem at the beginning for like 30 second then i got use to it.A few popular spiderman villains show up. The main Lead Villain is none other than the Kingpin who is basically trying to do what Cable did in Deadpool 2 movie but he is more sinister because the movie portrays him like such. He was able to over power 3 spider mans while giant Green Goblin struggled.Pacing in this movie was great, time went by fast because it was such a great film.We got to see various spiderman's from other universes. 2 Of which I think were forced in my opinion.The scene where Miles find out about the Prowler is probably the best scene in the movie.To conclude great movie. One of Sony-Marvels best since Spiderman 2. Its a fun flick for children who would understand the concept of universes and Spiderman fans.Again I know enough spiderman but not enough to say I'm a spiderman fan. Iunno which parts were accurate or not to the comics if that matters.9 out 10 because 2 of the spiderman's seemed forced.","

"masonsaul","16 December 2018","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse is an absolute masterpiece and easily the best Spider-Man film of all time. A funny, emotional and fresh story that plays with the tropes of an origin story to great effect. It also maintains clear focus on Miles yet still manages to give all the other Spider-people plenty to do whilst exploring the inspiring message that anyone can be Spider-Man and of course, redefining animation forever.Shameik Moore imbues his version of Miles Morales with a loveable awkwardness that matures into a crowd pleasing confidence, resulting in one of the most satisfying character arcs of recent memory. Jake Johnson is perfect as Peter B. Parker, with an equally satisfying arc as well as a humour and vulnerability that make him one of the best renditions of Spider-Man.Rounding out the main trio is Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy, closed off without being cold and the most mature of all the Spider-people. The rest of the cast are a lot of fun with John Mulaney and Nicolas Cage being the most memorable, playing exactly to the strengths you want them to.Rodney Rothman, Peter Ramsey and Bob Persichetti craft a beautiful film, the animation style is so unique and full of detail in every frame whilst staying true to its comic book roots as a comic book come to life. The pacing is also extremely impressive, managing to balance all these characters as well as a rogues gallery and do it all in under 2 hours.The music by Daniel Pemberton and the score are both incredible, both are given the time to shine at the right moments without overshadowing the other and Pemberton's score is unlike anything you've ever heard previously that starts strong and never gives up.","

"SnoopyStyle","23 February 2019","Peter Parker has been happily the one and only Spider-Man saving the city over and over again for the last ten years. Miles Morales hates his new school although he is taken with fellow new student Gwen Stacy. His policeman father tries to keep him away from troubled Uncle Aaron. He stumbles upon a battle between Spider-Man and Wilson Fisk with his henchmen, Green Goblin and Prowler. A portal is opened between the Spider-Verse.I really like Miles Morales. He's great with Gwen Stacy. The hair bit is hilarious. I'm over the moon for the first act. My first instinct is to have Jake Johnson play both Peter Parker. He's better acting as a slacker but if he could play the first Peter Parker, it would more compelling to see the change. The other issue is Gwen Stacy. She shows up before the incident. The movie explains it away as time travel but it would be better if it simply switched a couple of scenes. Overall, this is fun, imaginative, and glorious animation. It is also a great introduction to different Spider characters and holds potential for the live action movie world.","

"Semisonic","10 March 2019","Most of us have dreams. Not the ones about having a billion bucks or getting that girl, but the night time ones. So most of us would agree that in that twilight zone our brain unleashes its creativity, no longer bound by the constraints of reality, and that allows us to dream the most crazy and amazing stuff. And most bizarre and incoherent also. Especially if there were some substances consumed beforehand.In that sense, I'd agree with those who say that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an animation film we could dream for. I'm far from the comic book culture, but even I can admire the visual style of this film, made so that any still out of it could actually pass for a real comic book's frame. That aesthetics is brilliantly done, no questions about it.The rest of admiration, however, heavily depends on how much you are into TV cartoons, comic books and Spider-Man himself. This film loves to reiterate over and over again that it's based on an established universe, so there's an abundance of Spider-Man movie references and other allusions. If such things make you gasp in awe and maybe even shed a tear of nostalgic affection, you'll love it all. But for me as a non-Spider-man-acolyte, this soon became somewhat boring. I wanted to see something new, something unexpected.And something new I did receive! In the form of a slapstick action multiplied by the pseudo-scientific stuff as grotesquely absurd as it was far-fetched. And I can clearly see how Sony was inspired by the likes of Big Hero 6 and its outright fusion of the Western and Eastern kid entertainment culture, and of Ant-man and even Dr. Strange and their abundance of moving colored specks and nonsensical words in lieu of common sense. The deeper we go into the Spider-Verse, the more bizarre it looks, feels and acts, until we're forced to accept that there are no rules anymore to cling to and that pigs can indeed fly, just as trains.I do appreciate bringing a new stylistic vision into the world of full feature animation. But I can't say as much about bringing a popcorn bucket of LSD along with it, turning everything into a final battle from Final Fantasy, with its constant sparkle and rush and a muffled feeling that it used to mean something, but now you can't remember what exactly and it's way too late to stop and think about it.It was a fascinating trip while it lasted, but praising it as something more than that would be like retelling your dreams to someone else: you'd end up realizing how little sense your words make and feeling embarrassed about the whole idea.","

"The-Sarkologist","6 November 2021","I'm not really all that much into the animated Superhero films, but apparently this one was supposed to be pretty good so I decided to check it out. Honestly, it didn't really grab me all that much, no doubt because there are already quite a lot of Spiderman movies out there, and as such another one, in particularly an animated one, isn't really going to grab my attention. Look, it was okay, but in a way I do feel that there are probably too many Spiderman films around as it is.The story is that we follow a kid named Miles who happens to be starting up at a school for the gifted. He really doesn't want to go though namely because all of his friends are at a local public school, but he has won a scholarship there so his parents pretty much force him to go. The thing is that Spiderman is already running around, however one night when Miles is out with his uncle, he gets bit by a spider and starts to develop spiderman powers.Miles decides to go back and check the place out and discovers Spiderman fighting a nasty monster, and also attempting to turn off a device that Kingpin has built. The device opens a gate to the dimensions, and the reason that Kingpin wants it open is because he wants his family back (they were killed in a car accident).With the gate open, we suddenly have multiple spiderpeople coming from multiple dimensions, including a Peter Parker who is not only much older, but also has had his life pretty much head down the drain. Sure, he wants to stay, but the problem is that because he is from another dimension, they only has a limited amount of time here until they die.I'm probably giving too much away here anyway, but the thing is that in part the animation was nice, but it also became rather esoteric in places, especially the final battle with Kingpin. That actually makes me wonder whether we are actually going to see Kingpin in any of the films, particularly the MCU ones. Then again, there is apparently only one more Spiderman film being released, so what happens after that is yet to be seen. Anyway, that certainly doesn't look like Kingpin will be appearing in that one anyway.So, this film was okay, but it certainly didn't grab me the way some other films have.","

"CubsandCulture","16 December 2018","This is among the best films of the year and I really don't know what is the best part of it. The screenplay deftly interweaves a compelling origin story for a hero while deconstructing the notion of the monomyth while grappling with the cultural weight of Spider-Man. The screenplay is sharp, funny and emotionally resonant. Miles is a great character. Not a mere clone of Peter Parker but a person in his own right with unique foibles and desires. The screenplay does a lot to demonstrate the particulars of representation lead to different tonalities. It manages to make a really obvious twist hidden in the process of doing that as well. The story is great.But it is also realized in some of the most vivid, alive animation I have ever seen. The film's CGI is expressive in ways that CGI rarely is. The directors lean into the stylistic implications of the story, each of the Spider-people have a different look for example. But they manage to make the film feel whole and unitary. Best of all the mainstay of the animation feels like the bright marvel style of the 60's mixed with the vibrant world of street art. (Miles does graffiti). Comic panels, lettering, action sound text etc all make appearances. It was a massive risk that pays off. The visual scope of this film is amazing; it is simply incredible how alive this film feels despite the stylistic artifice.This is a film that truly works in every regard.","

"drael64","3 March 2019","The visuals, while extremely ADHD are beautiful and help mask the usual uncanny valley physics that plague CGI heavy movies. That said, what is actually happening in some scenes is pretty vague, generally it's too busy.The story telling is competent, when the writing isn't tripping over itself with overly concious lines, or progressive character tropes. At least unlike most such movies, the messaging doesn't entirely overtake the plot, and there is actual character development.And even with those progressive tropes, there is some messaging around courage, and tenacity, typical of heroic movies that are often absent in the more wish forfillment progressive typical story telling.Although for a hero origin movie, there is very little trace of self sacrifice, which is it's essential nature. Still, whilst it is somewhat hamfisted message fiction, they manage to wrap it into a plot that makes the film servicable and tucks the messaging into places where a less observant eye might miss it.In general, it's safe to say this is pitched at kids. Which makes me not the target audience. It's neither good, nor bad, whilst the comic book graphic style in itself is worthy of some praise.","

"RforFilm","17 December 2018","We've got Peter Parker. We've got web-shooters. We've got a group of villains called ""The Sinister Six"". Yep, we've got a Spider-Man movie again. It used to be we would go several years between the further adventures of New York's web slinger. Now were going months. In fact, Spider-Man had a big part of the MCU epic Avengers: Infinity War back in May. So what's going on in December that requires an additional movie? You'd be surprised by how vast the comic world is that does justify another movie.Like how many people have played a particular superhero, many people have played Spider-Man aside from Peter Parker. One popular addition is of another New York kid named Miles Morales. He garnered phrased for being the first half African-American, half Puerto Rican character to play a superhero. He was also noted for taking Spider-Man back to a youthful demeanor as Peter Parker in the story was getting a little old. But it doesn't stop there. There's also Spider-Woman, Silk, Spider-Noir, and even an anthropomorphic pig called Spider-Ham who operates on cartoon logic. While we don't exactly get all of them, we do get a bunch of them, along with an origin story for Miles in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.Young teenager Miles Morales (played by Shameik Moore) is adjusting to a new life at a prestigious boarding school academy, at the insistence of his cop father Jefferson (played by Brian Tyree Henry) who wants a better life for his son. Miles wants to impress his parents, but finds comfort in his more free spirited uncle Aaron (played by Mahershala Ali). One night, while the two of them do some graffiti art in a hidden area of the subway, not only does Miles get bitten by a spider, but also witnesses a battle and death of the popular Peter Parker Spider-Man while spotting Kingpin (played by Live Schreiber) working on a large machine that takes affect.Like Peter Parker's story, Miles starts to notice changes like sticking to walls and spider senses. He visits Peter's grave to think about what to do next. Its here where an older Peter Parker (Played by Jake Johnson) meets him and asks for help to help him return to his own dimension. While uncovering plans from Kingpin to open several dimensions, Miles also comes across Spider-Gwen (Played by Haile Steinfeld), Spider-Noir (Played by Nicolas Cage), Peni Parker (played by Kimiko Glenn) and her robot, and Spider-Ham (played by John Mulaney) who all help figure everything out.As you can see, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse juggles a lot and almost makes the mistake of cramming too much for one movie. Amazingly, the script not only keeps every character listed above in check, but also makes it a great story for young Miles Morales. If your worried that this is another origin story, this is one that puts a lot of focus of Miles and his relationship with his father and uncle. I can't disclose why, but it really creates new pressure that Peter Parker never had to face.In terms of the rest of the characters, I really like this side to Peter Parker that we had yet to get from the other adaptations; a Spider MAN. A man whose gone through so much and had his heart broken several times, that he's more of a broken hero that needs fixing himself. His story balanced out well with Miles. He also gets a good scene involving the aunt May of this universe, almost like seeing a living ghost that was very sweet. While I don't want to give too much away, each Spider person gets their own arc as they navigate their way through Mile's world.Let's talk about the animation, which looks great. Rather then going for a Pixar/DreamWorks look, this Spider-Man story has a comic book-look that takes advantage of that fact, along with that it's also animated. Unlike a lot of live action movies where use of computers can occasionally be distracting if not done well, it all blends well, especially with the action sequences. The angles remind me of the comic pages I still turn, given the use of color and word bubbles, that never become annoying, and are used accordingly to amplify the drama and comedy. This is a movie with the rare distinction where it's all it's own.I'll give this ten Spider-Man comics out of ten. This was a fun and different Spider-Man movie that we needed, even more then Spider-Man: Homecoming. It could come off as too weird for some, but given the story's focus is still on this kid's growth as a hero and a teenager, it never felt overwhelming. It was an odd example of everything accidently fitting into piece. This is an absolute recommendation. Swing in and go see it.","

"jakebirkel","19 December 2018","This had better win some Oscars.Okay, from the beginning: this movie is excellent. It is a thrill ride from start to finish, from being inventive to charting a new story to introducing so many good characters. Miles Morales' story is unique, emotional, and above all, fun.Performances: they're voice performances, so at first glance there isn't much to consider, but once you get further into the movie, you hear these actors truly commit to their characters. Shameik Moore's voice embodies Miles Morales perfectly, and Jake Johnson finally finds a character that's not a stoner; he does have fun with it. Haliee Steinfeld is exhilarating and perfect as Spider-Gwen. The rest of the cast... they're all fantastic, I just don't have time to talk about it right now. Go Spider-Ham!Direction/Writing: with three different directors, you'd expect this to come off as jumbled and incoherent, but it is not that at all. The scenes are well executed, the fight choreography is exhilarating, and the way they blend animation is simply stunning. The writing was soooooooo goooooooood. Phil Lord really had a story he wanted to tell, and he didn't skip out on any opportunity; somehow, we'll be laughing one minute and bawling the next. He really left it all on the field, especially with all ridiculous avenues he decided to go down with characters like Spider-Ham, Penny Parker, and Spider-Man Noire. The best part is it all works! The villain, Kingpin, is a bit sidelined, but it doesn't matter in the end because the story is about Miles and the people in his life. There's a moment in the trailer where Miles jumps off a building and we get this beautiful upside-down shot, and that moment is somehow even more satisfying given everything that leads up to it. The combo of story and characters truly does work.There's so many things I could talk about, from the immersive world to the killer soundtrack to the fact they use sound effects that correspond to the character's respective universes. You can feel the amount of time and effort that went into this movie, and you can feel that feeling of satisfaction that it paid off. It's a truly unique movie and inventive experience that is a sight to behold. (10/10)Seriously, Academy, look at this movie. And give it like all the awards.","

There's just too much of everything all the time. The creators should take more time and build ambience and atmosphere. The constant visual fireworks feels like an ADHD nightmare.The overabundance of childish slapstick comedy gets old really fast. Too bad the creators didn't have more ambition for more compelling writing. Miles Morales is a one-dimensional and uninteresting character. Then again, that's Brian Michael Bendis' fault.","

"ThomasDrufke","19 December 2018","We've gotten to the point in this golden-age of comic book movies where studios are starting to feel more comfortable taking storytelling risks. With Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Sony not only took a huge risk with the animation style, it's lead character, and bold story choices, but it's actually a very good film in its own right. Blending a heartfelt story, well-timed humor, and a bold animation style, Spider-Verse is the best Spider-Man film to date, and one that should garner all sorts of accolades. If it wasn't for an ending that gets bloated with hectic animation, it could flirt with some of my favorite animated movies of all time list. Either way, it's fun, infectious, and shows that the superhero genre has a long way to go before it runs out of unique ideas.8.9/10","

"martimusross","4 April 2019","I so want to agree with everyone that this movie was amazing and fantastic and perhaps the best thing since the invention of sliced bread, but when you look closely there are significant problems.Let's start with what was good;1, the comprehensive construction of Miles as a personality, from his dialogue to his jokes from his singing to his clumsiness, this was realised in micro-gestures and facial expressions as was Miles' father and uncle, a brilliant piece of animation.2, the movie created a comprehensive atmosphere and style and was planned and executed to an inch of its life.3, you were gripped from the start, whilst watching the movie there was a great dramatic impetus, you were desperate for a conclusion.4, the music, graphics and minute detail was all brilliantly realised.What was not good;1, if you take out the character development, that must be secondary to the story, we have boy infected by spider, trying to stop the Kingpin from using a machine to bring back his dead family, this is hardly a substantial story.2, if, and I believe it is the case, that the story above was incidental and that the ""real"" story was ""everyone can wear the mask"" this is using or abusing the vehicle of Spider-Man to advance forward a political agenda.3, if we had a parallel dimension then Spider-Man would be the same in each dimension, just as New York was the same in each dimension, if we had a alternative dimension then nothing would be the same so there would perhaps not be a Spider-Man, this was jumbled thinking at its best, which is it?4, we had blatant gender and racial appropriation and a whole array of divisive stereotyping that was used to underpin a political agenda, it was perhaps even gross tokenism, let's say no more.It cannot be right to use a movie to promote ideologies of globalisation, political correctness and identity politics and embed this within the core of a movie and this needs to be called out for what it is, this is indoctrination and liberal authoritarianism bordering on brainwashing.I did enjoy the movie whilst I was watching it but afterwards I felt I had been cheated, preached at and manipulated to a political world view, that is the latest Hollywood fashion trend, that places identity above everything and we are all citizens of nowhere.","

"grantss","7 October 2019","Miles Morales has just started at a new school and is struggling to fit in. Then he is bitten by a radioactive spider and he obtains certain powers, similar to those of Spiderman. He doesn't know what to do with the powers, or how to control them, so naturally he turns to Spider-Man for advice.Had some potential, initially, to be an original take on Spider-Man and comic book movies in general. The story doesn't follow Peter Parker, so is not the same Spider-Man story that's been told over and over before. Is animated, so original in terms of production (ironically, considering what comic book movies are based on...).However, despite these differences, it ends up being pretty much same old, same old: a linear, action-based story. Character development is token: everything is just a set up to get to the next action scene. Plot, what there is, is what you'd expect from a comic book movie: rambling, basic. Quite unengaging.Is fun at times, but certainly no more than your average comic-book movie.Hardly revolutionary, despite all the hype that says it is.","

"MooWoolf1","23 February 2019","I had no great expectations at all. Let's start with that. I haven't seen a single picture of the movie, so I had no idea what I was going to watch.I've seen the great reviews of it, some stating that they were expecting something super overrated and it turned out to be the opposite.
So.Here I'm. Long story short, I accept the fact that the majority of the people who have seen this have low needs. That's why movies such as Roma for example generated only $3m at the box office. People in general need easy movies, don't have to think at all, more colours the better, some silly jokes and there you go.
That's why they don't make movies like the Fight Club today. Those kinda movies don't get the money to be made because people wouldn't watch them. Sick and might be hard to accept for some of you, but it's true. De Palma and many others states that people tasted Cola and now they only want to drink Cola.This movie was predictable. I didn't like the style of it, but it was ok. New, but not good. It had it's silly jokes, many nonsense things. TONS of PLOTHOLES.
Also it was easy. VERY EASY. If you have seen any Spider-Man movie, series or something, then you have already seen this movie. Literally.I was just waiting when comes that moment that will lift this movie up that would make it to deserve it's score. I was truly hopefully waiting until the ending. Every scene somehow just kept bringing more and more nonsense things into the way, not even caring about the rules of the movie itself. Then at the end we had a Clark Kent moment, when he puts his glasses on and nobody can recognize him and the movie ended.Visually wasn't good. Have seen far better visuals in an animated movie.
The best thing about the movie was the uncle's theme song. I liked that.Otherwise this movie is no different from the most of those that take place in the top250.Not even close to The Lion King, Your Name, Spirited Away, Grave of the Fireflies. Even Monster Inc. had more in it.It is currently no. 26 and with it the no1 animated movie. Which is funny because it had 1 Oscar nomination only. WALL-E had 6. Toy Story 3 was even nominated as best feature. Both of these movies and better by far.So, in my opinion this movie is just a great example of what people need today and how easy it is to impress them. It was far harder before.It is going to win it's award for the same reason. But it wouldn't even deserve to be nominated. Hollywood is full of people that don't know what a movie is or should be, they just take part of making one trash like this.","

Not really, a standard origin story with a slight bit of 'zest' it's a surprise this film was so good given that the marketing is a bit underwhelming to be perfectly honest but that's beside the point. As a film this is fantastically executed and written to a degree where a million plates are being spun and not one falls in terms of narrative strands. Solid characters, moments of emotion and horror and an excellent clash of art styles and look there's something in this for everyone, from soundtrack to costume and everythkng between I recommend you watch","

"oscaralbert","21 December 2018",". . . and especially because they each opened in American theaters on December 14, 2018, viewers have naturally wondered whether MORTAL ENGINES and SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE tell the same story. The quick answer to this question is a simple ""Yes."" Let's examine some of the areas of congruence . The makers of MORTAL ENGINES and SPIDER-VERSE strive mightily to make their characters more ""diverse"" than a United Nations picnic. This is quite ironic, because these flicks emanate from New Zealand and Japan, two of the LEAST diverse, most homogenous places on Earth, with immigration policies that make the USA's current White House Occupant seem like a spiritual brother to the Statue of Liberty by way of comparison. However, SPIDER-VERSE deserves a higher satisfaction rating than MORTAL ENGINES because it celebrates a hallowed past (even after ALL of its end credits have rolled), while the latter flick runs out of gas desperately seeking to set up sequels which will rival HEAVEN'S GATE II, HOWARD THE DUCK QUACKS AGAIN, and ANOTHER ISHTAR when it comes to audience demand.","

"Richarduck4077","20 December 2018","When first saw the trailer for this I was not planning on it being this fantastic but I was so unbelievably wrong this Is the best Spider-Man movie ever in my opinion. This movie understands what Spider-Man means to people and and the universe it's build. The story features Miles Morales a character never seen in a movie before and it's captures his personality straight from the comics. The movie also features Peter Parker as a side character to make room for a new Spider-Man and I love this part of the story and how it introduces so many characters but doesn't feel crowded. The animation is also very beautiful, fluid and unique you'll never be bored. It's also very funny for kids of all ages to enjoy. It doesn't Matter your interested in comics or animation or comedy or a heartfelt super hero movie this movie is a great flick for all ages you should definitely see.","

"RuriGokou","9 April 2022","The word meandering sums up this movie very well. It just takes so long for the story to get anywhere. I'd say it takes about an hour into the movie for it to start moving. I kept reaching for my phone from time to time because I just couldn't focus. The humor is very hit or miss. There are some things inserted obviously for a younger audience. While some of the jokes did make me laugh, some also made me cringe or feel awkward.I liked the animation style but then again I'm a fan of anime. So I didn't have a problem with it.I couldn't like Miles very much. He was at least A LITTLE more likable in the PS4 video games. I don't understand why people are saying Peter was made out to be an idiot to prop up Miles in this movie. Miles acted like a weakling and a coward for a GOOD portion of the film. Despite the other universe Peter's circumstances, he at least was fighting. Besides, I think they made him that way to act like the fallen hero/mentor cliche.The female characters were more interesting than the male characters. Why don't they get there own movies? Gwen's story sounds a lot more interesting than Miles. And how she obviously was a ballet dancer and uses that in her fighting. It's interesting. But, I guess people of color trump a white woman?Overall, it's okay. But I don't see what all the fuss is about. Young kids will probably love this. But if you're always watching movies like me. You're not going to be impressed and just see all the flaws as you watch.","

"nancyldraper","15 December 2018","Disappointing. I was looking forward to this movie for two reasons: a great voice cast and the whimsy of multiple Spider Man/characters from varying dimensions. But instead of building interesting characters (heroes and villians) I was presented with a number of long, chaotic action sequences robbed of dramatic (or comedic) tension by the lack of well articulated characters and interpersonal dynamics. There was also a production anomaly that was puzzling - there were times when the animation was blurry as if drawn for 3D (there was a 3D version, but that wasn't the one I was viewing), so, I hastily put on my 3D glasses, which I happened to have at hand, and it was still 2D, just blurry ... odd(?). I hoped for a better story and entertaining character interactions but I was disappointed. I give this film a 5 (meh) out of 10. {Marvel Animation}","

"Phil_M_A_Kerr","19 December 2018","Using misaligned colour templates, like 3D without the glasses, for portions of the screen that were out of focus was a bold step. Bring them together and our eye is drawn to that now sharp part of the screen whilst everything else goes out of focus, or rather misaligned. What a different way to direct the audiences' eyes. Maybe a subliminal nod to the existence of parallel realities.
Like all good PG animations, the creators build a bit more depth into the narrative which makes the film a coming-of-age tale, leading the young viewers into the world beyond. Despair and faith, loss and hope, and all those adulty type themes are threaded through this three-dimensional ... no, MULTI-dimensional tale.
It is a silky-smooth incorporation of comic book panels, colours, and shading into a big screen motion picture.
The city slicker wit had me laughing out loud aplenty although it is occasionally too clever for this semi-rural simpleton.
This was a Tuesday night 9:30pm session with about a dozen adults and no kids so it was probably wasted somewhat without its target audience. Nevertheless, it is good to see the PG-rated teen animated epic is in capable hands.
When I was a lad we had epics like Watership Down, the Mouse Trap to enthrall is over the Festive period. I hope Into The Spiderverse delivers just as well to the current generation.","

"BenWollmuth","19 December 2018","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an ambitious film. Sony's last few attempts with the character of Spider-Man have been underwhelming to say the least. I haven't seen a good Sony owned Spider-Man movie since 2004's Spider-Man 2. Luckily, Spider-Man: Homecoming turned out to be a pretty good film, but that was mainly Disney and Marvel Studios, so I still had low expectations. However, I am happy to say that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an awesome Spider-Man film, and an amazing film overall.
Instead of following Peter Parker like every other Spider-Man film out there, this film instead tells the story of Miles Morales and how he handles being Spider-Man. This is a bit different, however, because instead of skipping the learning and the suit making, we see his struggles firsthand. Miles makes a promise to his world's original Spider-Man that he would put a stop to Kingpin, but he has no idea how to control his powers, so he has a hard time.
Luckily, Kingpin's fancy collider machine happens to bring in some other Spider-Man, as well, so that Miles can get the help that he needs. The best part about this film is the way the characters are handled. The writers understand the character of Spider-Man, no matter what dimension he/she is from. They all have different personalities and art styles that make them stand out from each other. They did such a great job that I now want to see spin-off films for all of the Spider-Men in this movie.
Into the Spider-Verse is a lighthearted film, and is able to mix seriousness with comedy for the perfect effect. From the comedy aspect, the film, as I said before, understands Spider-Man. He is a funny character and knows how to stay calm in any situation. He cracks goofy jokes and says witty one-liners. With this movie, the different personalities of the different Spider-Men mixing together brings the comedy. On the other hand, the serious family issues bring some conflict to different characters, but in order to keep this spoiler free, I will not go in depth.
There is one issue I have with the film, but it isn't too big. Okay, the character is too big, but the issue is not. Kingpin, I feel, needed more characterization in order for me to think of him as a good villain. We learned some things about his family, but that was really it. He was a just a large man who wanted to conduct an evil plot. I can look past this, however, because the movie wasn't really focused on Kingpin. It was more focused on the Spider-Men, and most importantly, Miles Morales. Since this was done so well, I can forgive the film the Kingpin issue.
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was a film that was much needed on Sony's part, because it shows that they still have good things they can do with the character. Animation, I feel, is the best format for Spider-Man, but that might be because I grew up watching the Spider-Man animated series. Overall, this is an awesome film, and definitely deserves a watch. If you are a Spider-Man fan, I believe you will truly adore this movie as much as I did. If you are a heavy critic who doesn't know much about the character of Spider-Man, I think you will enjoy this movie too. If you just like movies in general, go out and see this movie. It's worth it.","

"kosmasp","25 November 2020","If you are going to go animated, why not just go all the way with it. And while Nicolas Cage will not ever become Superman (at least real action life in movies), why not give him something else to really dig himself in and just relish ... having fun with it and sharing that fun with us.The movie is quite self aware. From the whole origin story, to what happened before (even making fun of the Spidermans before - the ones Sony did, not the Marvel Cinematic Universe mind you). And it all works out fine, while being culturally appropriate and adding to the mythology. The dialog feels fresh, the story is cool and we get so many funny things thrown our way ... not just for fans of the previous movies or comics ... this really is great. And I say that as a big MCU fan myself, but it makes me happy that Sony will continue to do their own thing too! Especially if they stay as creative as this! There can be more than one! This movie is all the evidence you need for that ...","

I feel bad for the other animated films this year, because Into the Spider-Verse blows them all out of the water. It's hard to believe this is the same animation studio that made the smash hit The Emoji Movie. Spider-Man: Homecoming is still my favorite from the hero, but this one is not far behind. My only, tiny complaint is that the villains weren't very fleshed out, but with the multiple Spider men and women needing adequate backgrounds and screen time, I can easily look past it. This is a superhero movie for the typical fans or the oblivious viewer, creating the always beautiful message that anyone can wear the mask. We're all a lit bit Spider-Man.","

"shawneofthedead","13 December 2018","THE LOW-DOWN: Does the world really need another Spider-Man movie? In just over 15 years, we've already had three different Peter Parkers, each one with the same basic origin story. It's a reliable formula that's been run into the ground... hasn't it? And yet, Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse will have you clamouring for more. This fresh, funny, fantastic film proves that there's entire universes of mileage left in all things Spider-Man - introducing us to brand-new hero Miles Morales, while also dissecting (and reinforcing) our love for good ol' Peter Parker.THE STORY: Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) is a high-school kid just trying to figure out his purpose in life - which sharpens somewhat terrifyingly into focus when he's bitten by a radioactive spider and finds himself literally climbing the walls. Suddenly, he's forced to assume the mantle of Spider-Man, battling to save the world from the heartbroken insanity of Wilson Fisk (Liev Schreiber). It's a tall order for a half African-American, half Puerto-Rican kid from Brooklyn but, fortunately, Miles soon discovers that he isn't alone in the universe...THE GOOD: Where to even begin? Into The Spider Verse is a delight in practically every way. First and foremost, it's remarkably refreshing to see a character like Miles - a young man of mixed-race descent - get his own superhero origin story. It helps enormously that the screenplay, credited to Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman, is equal parts sweet, sharp and snarky. Some superhero movies (*cough*DC*cough*) can take themselves too seriously, but Into The Spider Verse skewers Spider-Man's cinematic history with a cheeky charm that's impossible to resist. Miles also leads a cast of enormously appealing characters, including clever twists on fan favourites like Peter Parker (Jake Johnson), Aunt May (Lily Tomlin), Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) and Doctor Octopus (REDACTED).THE NOT-SO-GOOD: There's almost too much going on, all the time. Into The Spider Verse is stuffed to the brim with multiple characters, multiple universes and multiple plot-lines - so much so that the emotional weight of Miles' fraught relationships with his dad (Brian Tyree Henry) and uncle (Mahershala Ali), which should tear audiences apart, comes close to getting lost amongst the shift and shuffle of the plot. It's hardly a deal-breaker, though: the narrative beats are all there, ready to be savoured and rediscovered on a rewatch.THE GLORIOUSLY GEEKY: Comic-book fans, rejoice - this one's for you. There's a soul-deep love for Spider-Man lore threaded through every gorgeous frame of this movie. Naturally, it's right there in the plot, as alternate universes collide and truly cult characters tumble into Miles' life. But it's the medium of animation that makes the real difference here. It's why Into The Spider Verse can embrace its comic-book roots in a way that live-action movies can't. In some of the film's most visually arresting sequences, Miles leaps and soars in and out of frame, trailing sound effects and narration in his wake. This living, breathing comic-book effect is the crowning achievement of Sony's animation arm - not only is it fluid and stunning, it's ridiculously inventive, mixing and matching animation styles to further plot and develop character.WATCH OUT FOR: Easter eggs galore! Spider-Man and Marvel aficonados should keep their eyes peeled for references peppered throughout the film. The late Stan Lee's cameo will break and warm your heart in equal measure. Meanwhile, Brian Michael Bendis and Sara Pichelli, who co-created Miles Morales, are name-checked, as are concepts and terms well-known to fans of the comics (Earth-616 and all). Stay through the credits for a series of of wonderful, silly rewards, including a song off Spider-Man's novelty Christmas album and some intriguing scenes that hint at where this new animated franchise might go. (A sequel and spin-offs have already been greenlit! 🙌) ALSO, this film features possibly the best use of Nicolas Cage in a movie since National Treasure!*RECOMMENDED? YES. Into The Spider Verse isn't just the best Spider-Man movie that nobody asked for - it's one of the best Spider-Man movies ever made, period. It's also a top contender for best animated film of the year.*Okay, fine, having Cage voice Superman in this year's Teen Titans Go! To The Movies was genius too - a nod to his life-long goal to play Superman. Maybe Cage should stick to voiceover work... 🤔","

"Aleta_Nook","8 December 2019","The main character is a little aloof brat! I could not stand 10 minutes of this little brat whining and arguing and ignoring his father! He is so disrespectful. Maybe he gets better and I don't know what the original Miles was like but I don't care to watch anymore. I don't know why everyone finds him so likeable, he's so overrated. I know you two have different worldviews but be like Flint Lockwood and at least be more caring and try to respect your father, Miles.","

"piggulu","16 December 2018","Overall, I found the whole thing underwhelming. While the animation and comic book style is excellent, the movie suffers from a monumental case of identity. Excluding the parallel universe concept, it initially presents itself as grounded/realistic. Average kid just wanting to be a kid, etc. But then it heaps on unspectacular one-liners/physical gags reminiscent of old cartoons (Kingpin's design and Peter Porker) I felt like I was watching a Dreamworks animation film, and although I easily classify myself as ""young at heart"" and am always a fan of classic Looney Toons(Tunes?) I didn't find much particularly funny here. Which leads to the question: who is the main audience, young/older adults or primarily kids? It doesn't really play strength to either. Is the movie an ensemble film? Not really, Miles is so much the main focus that the rest of the could've been left out entirely or just appeared at the end and it probably would've made a tighter film. None of them get to personally shine or have a memorable moment. One can argue that's part of the charm of ""Anyone can wear the mask"" but I disagree.Honestly, if it wasn't for the eye strain from the 3D then I most likely would've fell asleep.","

"WisdomsHammer","2 July 2019","Ok, first of all, if you are ages 8-11 and like super hero movies I think this maybe might be your thing. Maybe. I think it's aimed at more like 15 year olds but they forgot and made most of it a silly cartoon. Oh well.Overall, I did like this. I had fun and thought it was entertaining. But it's not a 10. It's a 7 probably. There are too many things that don't work for me.Probably my biggest beef in this thing is that our hero goes from zero to hero in ONE SCENE.Not exaggerating, he goes from a kid so dumb that he plays in traffic, refuses to tie his shoe, can't walk down a hallway without bumping into people, and just stands there with his mouth open most of the time (this happens so often in the first three quarters of the movie that it's repetitive - they really want to pound it into us just how dumb Miles is) to a courageous superhero in complete control of his faculties and sophisticated superpowers - IN ONE SCENE.Come on! Where's the training montage? They tease a training montage in several wasted scenes and never give us one. Training montages have worked since kung fu movies and Rocky! Are we not doing those anymore? I think that's a mistake. But whatever.And when exactly was his ""with great power comes great responsibility"" moment for making mature choices?Where the hell did that spider come from? Why did it take so long to bite him? Why did it crawl over his entire body (without him feeling it) and then decide to bite his hand in particular when it could have bitten him anywhere? To give a two hour movie 5 minutes of padding?What audience is this aimed at? We've got some great mature themes, coming of age themes, and we've got Spider-Pig. I guess they just decided to scattergun this thing and try to hit everyone. It's surprising that it works at all. Pixar does wide audiences well. This thing has individual scenes aimed at different audiences and it feels disjointed to me.What worked for me:
The animation. Incredible.The voice acting. Loved the performances. Disney does this very well.Half the writing: Peter B. Parker's story in particular, Miles' relationship with his father and his uncle, Spider-Gwen (would have liked to have seen more of her and I bet we will).All the easter eggs, from the comic books to the stupid theme song to the Gwen Stacy moment to the dumb finger pointing meme after the end credits and more.The overall plot and storylineWhat didn't work for me:
Half the writing: How dumb they made Miles through the first three quarters of the movie, and putting him in complete control of his powers in a single scene in particular. Pace it out a little more!Spider-Man NoirSpider-HamAunt May is apparently Spider-Man's version of Batman's Alfred now? NO.Most of the silly slapstick cartoon humorThe character design and seemingly indestructable qualities of KingpinIndividual storylines that seemed to be aimed at different audience demographicsThere's more I suppose, but this is a good enough run down. There are a lot of reviews out here so I'm doubting many will read this. I'm kind of writing this for myself to remember what I thought of this thing if I ever watch it again.7/10 for me but I'm rating it 6 because there are WAY too many 10s here.","

"andresromerocompain","23 December 2018","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a masterpiece. It is by far the best Spider-Man movie today. It's such a refreshing and creative take on a Spider-Man movie while at the same time doing something completely different and incredibly creative with him and very fascinating. The animation in this movie is beyond amazing, and it was so cool and interesting to see the way this movie was animated. That is really the highlight of this movie. Especially adding on to the fact that all the acting is fantastic, the dialogue is wonderful and rich, the characters are awesome and funny, and the story is fantastic and fresh. This by far is the best movie of the year, which is shocking and so unexpected. This beautifully paced, action packed, heart filled movie is the one you must see in the theater this Christmas. Also cause it did manage to be the best Spider-Man movie and Marvel movie today, how mind blowing! Not only that, the people who made this have proven they truly have an understanding to the character of Spider-Man.","

"Ch4ndler_B1ng","7 January 2022","Spider Man: Into the Spider Verse is one of the greatest and most original movies I have ever watched! It has a completely fresh and different style compared to any other comic book movie I've watched, now I don't just think this is the best animated movie ever, I think it's the best Spider Man movie ever, the best superhero movie ever and one of the best movies ever, which is a massive accomplishment. Considering the Sony movie that came before it was The Emoji Movie, most people were skeptical, but leaving that theatre, I have no doubt in my mind people were blown away! The idea of a multiverse is sick, but it's even sicker when it is executed like it was in Into the Spider Verse, it is often considered the best Spider Man movie of all time, even by Raimi trilogy fans (such as myself) and it definitely deserves that title. It balances seriousness and comedy without falling down, and that ""What's up Danger?"" scene is magnificent and one of the best scenes in cinema history!All the people from different Spider-verses are likeable and hilarious, every scene could be made into a poster because of how aesthetically pleasing the entire movie is. The background stories for each time we are introduced to a new spider-person are excellently done and the villains are also done really well. This is a rare example of superhero movie perfection.","

"generationofswine","29 December 2018","I'll be upfront, I'm giving this 1 star because of the treatment of Peter Parker.They didn't do the Andrew Garfield thing and turn him into a bully. But they did do that Modern Marvel Comics thing and turn him into an idiot screw-up in an effort to alienate the fans and somehow make Miles better by mocking Peter.And I'm not a fan of that. Parker is a dork, he's got a smart mouth...but he's really smart, a genius, totally heroic, and well, the call him ""The Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man"" for a reason. He cares, specifically he cares about the average working schulb.This kind of just took Peter Parker and almost mocked him and, honestly, I can't get behind that. i couldn't get behind it when they turned him into a bully in the Garfield movies, and I don't care for it when they mock him here.","

"derk144","14 December 2018","The best animated film of the year. It just goes to show you that you can have a superhero film with 6+ heroes, 6+ villains, with plenty of fan-service & cameos that still is easy to follow while telling a compelling story. Comic fans can enjoy the amount of details included for them, while general audiences still understand who the good guys vs the bad guys are without a huge backstory for each character. The different Spider-People (Persons of Spider?) could all carry their own films, showing off drastically different art styles & a great voice cast. The animation is some of the most uniquely stunning visuals I've seen on screen, looking like comic book pop-art brought to life with newsprint texture, dialogue bubbles, & fluid motion. The writing is tight with plenty of heart & tons of laughs. It's a coming of age tale about a teenager who doesn't necessarily want to be a hero but feels that he's the only one who can in his realities time of need. I hope to see more from this animated Spider-Verse in the future.","

However, on the other side: linear and one-sided characters, which are not properly introduced, and I still doubt, why some of them were in the film. Like, if you remove them NOTHING will change.
The last thing to say: I belive the film is overvalued. Yes, it is beautiful, new generation, so to say, BUT, I can't agree that this film has the right to stay in line with one of the best films in the World. It is always easier to draw a cartoon full of emotions than to show emotions of a real person.","

Let me start with what I found to be its strengths:Amazing animation and production design, and good performances on the voice cast.The faults were clear as well: a bit of a messy script with much focus on aesthetics, very fast pacing and not much investment into the character arcs. Example given: King Pin was never really an unstoppable force, nor very threatening when encountered close-up.All in all a treat and original in its visual style, but fundamentally lacking a mature script, as well as well-developed character arcs.","

There is enough humor, action, dazzling visuals, drama, and most importantly... H E A R T in this film for FOUR MOVIES. If you like any of the aforementioned characteristics, you should go see this movie on the largest screen possible.
Now, for my fellow fans of the wise cracking wall crawler....this was a dream come true!!! All the character variations....all the classic villains....a nod to the TV shows, a nod to the previous films, a very touching dedication to @therealstanlee and Steve Ditko, all while telling an original story that was an absolute BLAST to watch.

"lahejarishabh","15 December 2018","There have been so many spiderman films, each of which was cut off from a sequel and rebooted over and over. However, this could alone stand out to be a much better spiderman film in comparison to them all. Into the spiderverse takes you on a sci-fi adventure of multiverse, a spiderman film we have all been waiting for.The animation alone stands out to be the best feature about this film. This new style of comic book animation is top notch and a must watch especially for comic book lovers. The efforts taken in creating and rendering this film was worth it. The film is innundated with so much of high quality design, byzantine animation, one can't take their eyes off the screen and even afford to miss a scene.Even though it has a small run time to it, as most animated films do, this film offers a good character development and good storyline which is unpredictable at times making you shout out ""wow"" especially if you are a spiderman geek.There is an adequate amount of humor. The humor is not forced at all, it has good one liners that makes you enjoy the film from the very beginning. Into the spiderverse is a fun, fresh take on the spiderman story filled with excellent quality content, brilliant animation, lots of humor and exciting action sequences.","

"TheHoodOfSwords","16 June 2020","So like... going into this film I was incredibly optimistic and excited. Because the last time I saw this I gave it a 9/10 and the only reason I didn't give it a 10/10 was because I thought Miles got too good too fast. Then I realized, all the Spider-Mans have that happen. This one though actually focussed on the teaching part which I really enjoyed. Miles isn't a god at web-slinging immediately, he grows and has to overcome his arc. It's his origin story, and surprisingly even with a gigantic cast of characters, 4 villains and 6 Spider-people the movie still feels like Miles's story and he never feels shifted to the side for anything.One thing that I think this movie absolutely nails is the fluidity of Spider-Man. They move with such elegance and grace (Most of the time at least) In a way that animation can really bring out and show. Ever flip and roll all feel incredibly fluid and it moves from one scene to the next with such grace. A lot of the time during movies I do what I like to call the three pauses. 1 at 20 minutes, which is usually me deciding if I want to actually watch the movie, one an hour in to see how much is left and then one more at an hour and a half because I feel that length elapsing. In this movie I didn't pause once (With the exception of a sync error) I had to pee so incredibly bad for the last 20 minutes but I was so captivated by the colours and story I didn't want to.The villain and soundtrack in this movie were good, I say villain but this is one of these movies where, not to sound corny but you can say that the main villain is just growing and evolving as a person. Struggling to find your place in the world. The pop hip hop soundtrack didn't blow me away but I don't think that's the intention. It elevates what Miles is feeling a lot of the time and it never overstays its welcome.Yeah man... the colours in this film are brilliant. It's like if you took Thor Ragnarok and multiplied it by a thousand billion million trillion. For a movie set in New York which I can say from experience does not have a lot of colours this movie really makes you feel immersed in a kaleidoscope of colourful mess. But not mess in a bad way, mess in a way that's so comforting.This movie also made me cry, it's the second to ever do that. Just wanted to mention that.If a superhero movie is like a grilled cheese sandwich this is like if you threw that sandwich out the window, made a 20-course meal using every atom from that grilled cheese in a way that nobody has ever thought of before. For a movie that feels so much like a comic book superhero movie, it's somehow so incredibly refreshing and brilliant. Can't wait for the sequel and can't wait to see my crush Gwen in the next movie. Please for the love of god watch this movie. WATCH THIS!!!","

One other thing that spoils things in a massive way..... why is Spider-Man, Superman, Hulk etc special??? ..that's right, because there is only 1 of them.

"elicopperman","16 December 2018","If there's one notable superhero with a very hit or miss track record when it comes to their film adaptations, it has to be Marvel's iconic Spider-Man. Whether they be the right blend of goofiness and emotional drama with Sam Raimi's trilogy, or the embarrassingly lackluster Amazing Spider-Man series, the web slinging hero has been through as many duds as successes. However, there has never really been an animated feature with this hero or any incarnations....until now. Ever since the first trailer dropped last year, the buzz for this particular film blew up, mainly due to it focusing on a new Spider-Man, Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales. After finally seeing it, I can officially confirm that the wait was beyond worth it.The main storyline revolves around Miles Morales becoming the next Spiderman after getting bitten by a radioactive spider. However, the evil Kingpin creates a portal to other universes that goes haywire and ends up pulling distinct versions of Spider-Man into Miles' world. Upon meeting Peter Parker, Miles now has to take Kingpin down and bring those incarnations back. With all that said, the film rests on Miles' shoulders to lead, and he is one hell of a protagonist. Alongside being very likable, the film does a great job of establishing his relationships, personality and even emotions. I also like how he only grows accustomed to his powers after many trials and tribulations with all the craziness going around. Even his interactions with Peter Parker feel like that of an apprentice learning from a master, they're so much fun to watch.In addition, the film happens to be a great blend of self referential humor and emotional drama. Screenwriters Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman cram in plenty of in-jokes for hardcore Spider-Man fans in a subtle manner without losing newcomers, making them feel connected within the narrative. As for the emotional weight, it stems from Miles' different bonds between his father and uncle Aaron, and both are well woven into the plot. There are even scenes with the two around Miles that one would never expect from a film like this. For a film with several villains, they all have just enough screen time to be memorable, especially Kingpin, mainly because his reasons behind making the portal are more elaborate than first assumed. Never has a superhero film managed to squeeze in the right amount of humor and pathos to work well as a part comedy and part drama since The Incredibles and The Lego Batman Movie.As for the other characters, Peter Parker is established as the pessimistic hero turned failure, yet his relation with Miles gains him more confidence to get back into the swing of things (no pun intended). Throughout the film, we really feel for the guy and want him to succeed as much as Miles, making him come off as a sympathetic albeit charismatic mentor. Gwen Stacy is also appropriately placed within the film's narrative, as rather than being a Mary Sue, she plays as a voice of reason to Miles and hopes the best for him, like a real partner should do. As for the multiple dimensions featured, there's the 1930s serious dramatic Spider-Noir, the goofy and comical Spider-Ham, and the bubbly anime girl Peni Parker. While not given as much attention as Miles and Peter, they still end up stealing the show with their distinct quirks and charm, and their voice actors, especially Nic Cage, bring them to life as much as the script and animators do. It's rare when a film is able to squeeze in so many characters yet still manages to give them enough presence to leave an impact.Lastly, the animation is incredibly versatile, vivid, colorful and even grim, really emulating the feel of a graphic comic book. The characters are all uniquely designed based on their appearance and personality, especially the Spider-Man incarnations looking distinct based on their physical appearance. Spider-Noir is black & white with shadows all around, Spider-Ham is very cartoony and bouncy, and Peni Parker is every anime girl ever made cranked up to 11. Not to mention, the action scenes are fantastically well directed, as the stakes really rise up with a lot of well choreographed fighting moves and a briskly paced flow. It's also worth praising how the film conveys its emotions through the color scheme depending on the scene, saying way more than any amount of dialogue ever could. My only issue with the animation is that it can look a little blurry at times, but that's more of a nitpick as it's intentionally built that way.Overall, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has got to be my absolute favorite addition in the Spiderman film franchise. It also might be the most imaginative and innovative comic book film on screen in years thanks to its wonderful stylistic choices, humorous antics, well woven drama, and characters you will never forget. If you are yet to see this, please give this film as much support as you can, it's definitely a blast to sit through. We rarely get superhero films like this nowadays, so giving it the attention it deserves will mean more sequels and huge cult status for years to come. Sony Pictures Animation has only scratched the surface with what Miles Morales can do, so here's to more great adventures with the new up and coming Spider-Man in the future.","

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","13 December 2018","***(Spoilers Ahead)***Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is so much better than anyone expected it to be: it's the kind of film people don't realize they want so badly, and when it comes, it's a breath of fresh creative air. This film's the best kind of crazy: alternate dimensions, cartoony-drama (family issues and dying mentors) mixed with humour (cartoon pigs, film-noir cliches and Japanese mechas), culturally remixing Spider-Man into a living and breathing idea; anyone can be him, and what makes them different defines their own Spider-Man.Spider-Man is still one of my all-time favourite characters: he's tied with Batman and Superman as far as I'm concerned, and it was high time that Spider-Man got his own theatrically released animated feature. Spider-Verse honours the character and then some with its wholly unique animation style, its star-studded voice-actors and the whole thing feeling like the sort of thing Stan Lee would have wanted to see on the big screen. Stan unfortunately passed away before the film's release, so hopefully he got to see an early screener copy of the film. Who knows? It sucks that he's gone now; but his creations (his brain children) live on through the endless stream that is modern pop-culture. This movie's definitely a zeitgeist piece for Spider-Man: a self-aware love-letter to a character whom both comic and non-comic fans know and love openly.This film delves into the origin story of Miles Morales: and how he became Spider-Man after Peter Parker is killed by Wilson Fisk (The Kingpin). We see Miles' dilemma of being himself play throughout the movie, and when the Spider-Men from the multiverse come into his reality, they help overcome his deep-inhibitions. This movie doesn't gloss over the dramatic stuff easily (Kingpin's family die in a car-crash) and it somehow manages to balance out the humour with the serious stuff ridiculously well (Spider-Ham and Spider-Gwen compliment the comedy-drama duality of the film). Spider-Verse is the comic book movie people have wanted since Frank Miller's Sin City: it's got that same to-the-T comic-book styling to it; and I don't say that lightly at all. It's something amazing to behold on the big screen.If only animated cinema in general could acknowledge that it's okay to be as aesthetically liberal with animation as people can (and do) go with live-action cinema through endless variations of stories, genres, styles and motifs. I think movies like Spider-Verse show that Disney's animated fairy-tales (while still being very enjoyable) don't represent what animation CAN be like Japanese animation does, but films like Into The Spider-Verse represent what animation inevitably WILL be: a varied landscape as diversified as any medium in life can possibly get. The 2010s have been a rather progressive time for American animation and I'm more than happy to see Hollywood tackle things outside the 'Disney fairy-tale comfort zone'.I loved every second of this movie and I'm stoked for the sequels and spin-offs! This movie was a SUPER-BLAST!P.S. Stan Lee, Steve Ditko: you both made the world a happier place to be thanks to your genius creation.","

"namashi_1","27 December 2018","Spider-Man movies have been really good. The ones helmed by Sam Raimi were particularly impressive, as those films focused on the idea of the boy beneath the mask, Peter Parker. The ""Amazing Spider-Man"" movies seemed lazy and hence 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse', being an animation tale, seems to be a risk.But let me tell you, 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is nothing less than Blockbuster Entertainment! Yes, this is the Ideal Christmas film, that is high on action, emotion and comedy. And of course...soul! I don't remember having so much fun at a Superhero film since Black Panther!'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' Synopsis: Miles Morales becomes the Spider-Man of his reality and crosses paths with his counterparts from other dimensions to stop a threat to all reality.'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is a joyride from the word go. Miles is an interesting protagonist with his own demons and powers that he comes to realize, but this film brims in Magic and brings in too many Spidey's from other dimensions to offer us a blockbuster in its truest sense. I won't give away much spoilers, but this is a film, that deserves to be viewed with your entire family. Its got the bite!Phil Lord & Rodney Rothman's Screenplay is superb all through. Running high on energy while also focusing on soul and substance, this Animation film never runs out of breath. While the action is simply amazing, the emotional connect among its primary characters is what really stands out. Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman's Direction is excellent, as the animation gets enough scope to leave your eyes fun-filled. A special mention for Daniel Pemberton's Score and Robert Fisher Jr.'s Editing.The Vocal Performances are top-notch all across the board. Shameik Moore as Miles Morales / Spider-Man hits all the right notes, giving us a hero who must explore his own voice. Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker / Spider-Man is absolutely fantastic. Nicolas Cage as Peter Parker / Spider-Man Noir does a remarkable job and seems to be having a ball. Kathryn Hahn as Olivia ""Liv"" Octavius / Doctor Octopus and Liev Schreiber as Wilson Fisk / The Kingpin, voice the menaces to perfection.On the whole, 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is a winner all the way. It's a blockbuster that has heart and soul. What else could you ask for?","

A beautiful blend of 3D computer animation and 2D elements. Occasionally aspects are ripped directly from the pages of the comics too, with sound effects written on screen or occasionally splitting the image in to panels. It's a unique and dynamic experience. That would be for naught though if the script and story wasn't up to much, so fortunately the film excels here too. The story finds a legitimate excuse to drag the various Spidys together and actually gives them something to do. It's funny too, self-referential to the universe, to the medium and to the film itself. The highlight of the humour is probably ""Spiderman Noir"" a 1930's detective version of the web slinger, whose whole world is monochromatic and is voiced with laconic style by Nicolas Cage.It does have some darker moments though, a couple of deaths that would be a bit much for some of the younger children in the audience. Stan Lee's cameo too, though nothing specific about the cameo is sad, it still pretty emotional for his first one since he passed (if you ignore ""Ralph Breaks The Internet""). Also, at least in the screening I saw, occasionally the image seemed to .... Duplicate somewhat ... as if you were watching a 3D film without glasses on.But those minor detractions won't take away from a magnificent film that I'd really like to see more of.","

"jon.h.ochiai","24 December 2018","""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is astounding stylized state-of-art animation with the look and feel of 3-D Japanese Anime. The animation is visually shadowed and soulful with vibrant pastels. Not just mesmerizing eye-candy, team of Directors - Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman craft a fresh rites of passage narrative of immerging Spider-Man, half-African American Miles Morales, voiced by spirited and smart Shameik Moore. Although in Phil Lord (""The Lego Movie"" and ""22 Jump Street"") and Rodney Rothman's screenplay, Miles is one of several 'Spider-Men' and 'Spider-Women' intersecting in this Marvel superhero, sci-fi, family mashup.Turns out that villain ""Kingpin"", voiced by malevolent Live Schreiber, the blockish hulking bald cartoon figure used his invention - the Super Collider to collapse the multiverse. To what ends? Honestly, I don't think even Phil and Rodney know. That might be beside the point. Because, ""Into the Spider-Verse"" is just raucous fun with a warped sense of humor and a big heart.Directors Bob, Peter and Rodney introduce the Spider-Man in New York that we all know and love: Peter Parker, voiced by whimsical Chris Pine. He's the guy, who was bitten by the radioactive spider that gave him his amazing strength, agility and 'spidey sense' as in sixth sense. After an extended Superhero career of 22 years including his failed marriage to the love of his life Mary Jane, voice by Zoe Kravitz, Spider-Man dies as a Hero, doing what he loves to do: Saving others.Miles is a teen attending a college prep school on scholarship: The brilliant computer geek, who chills to Post Malone. His Dad Jefferson Davis, voiced by stalwart funny Brian Tyree Henry, is a police officer, who not a big fan of Spider-Man and his ""along with great power comes great responsibility"" dogma. Somewhat self-absorbed, he unconditionally loves Miles. Jefferson even coerces Miles to say, ""I love you, Dad."" - in front of his entire school.At school Miles is sweet on pretty smart blonde Gwen Stacy, voiced by wonderfully aloof Hailee Steinfeld. Their attraction is mutual. Miles derives security in his relationship with his Uncle Aaron, voiced with street gravitas by Mahershala Ali. Aaron and his brother Jefferson Davis are estranged, given Aaron questionable shady dealings. Yet, Aaron is the cool Uncle, who encourages Miles's distinct gift as the street tagger of amazing urban spray paint murals. While working one of his masterpieces, Miles is bitten by what looks like a radioactive spider. Consequently, Miles acquires his Spider-Man powers.At the same time Miles meets his alter-dimensional persona in older paunchy Peter B. Parker, voiced by funny, mildly cynical Jake Johnson, who teaches Miles the ropes of Spider-Man's web-slinging. While escaping from Kingpin's facility and swinging through the snowy forests, Peter and Miles encounter sleek white suited Spider-Gwen - Gwen Stacy (Hailee). Turns out too, that Gwen is the Spider-Woman from yet another dimension. Like Peter, she also needs to return to her home dimension.So it's up to Miles, who must wrestle control of Kingpin's Super Collider, to forge the dimensional pathway back to their respective dimensions. Meanwhile, Miles meets Spider-Men from other dimensions. Black and white Spider-Man Noir, voiced by off-the-wall Nicolas Cage, is from a past dimensional era. There's Warner Brothers-like cartoon Spider-Ham, voiced by hysterical John Mulaney. Life-size Japanese Anime Peni Parker, voiced by quirky Kimiko Glenn, is from the 31st Century sporting her advanced robotic Spider-Man. As Peter says, ""This could literally not get weirder."" Balancing this phase-glitched universe are versions of Spider-Man's villains: Green Goblin, Scorpion, and a few others that I don't recognize.There is a whole lot of nonsense running amok in ""Into the Spider-Verse"", yet the directors resonate in asking, ""What makes a Hero?"" With surprising poignancy, cartoon Spider-Ham tells emerging Hero Miles, ""You can't save everyone."" Otherwise, the great responsibility and power become a curse.When Miles has doubts that he can become the Hero, Peter tells him, ""Take a leap of faith."" Believe in the hero that's within all of us. Our Heroes arise from our belief from within, and from the love those who believe in us. For Miles that's the world-weary and wise Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker, and brave and compassionate Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen. Radiant Shameik Moore makes us believe that his Miles shall discover his own greater than self within.""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is about summoning the Hero within all of us. Even more so than the amazing animation, that narrative makes ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" one of my favorite movies this year.","

"kirstyabuchanan","23 December 2018","Finally an animation with suspense and drama. With the other animation that came out this year I didn't have high hopes for this but to my surprise this roller-coaster of a story was amazing. The animation was spot on everything looked great. Very well picked voice actors. I'm looking forward to see where they take this next.","

With several super-hero movies a year, I know this is the movie I'd remember from this year!This is a masterpiece with a nice balance with music, graphics, story telling and thrill.

Super fresh story, incredible animation style, characters that we'll hardly see on the big screen soon, plenty of fun moments and tons of comicbook references.Absolute joy, especially if you're comicbook nerd. It has already been confirmed that there will be a sequel and honestly, I can not wait.Go and see for yourself. One hundred percent you'll not be disappointed at the end...the very end.","

"AdrenalinDragon","6 December 2018","Man I'm shocked to like this movie as much as I did. I never would have guessed it would have been one of my favourites of 2018. I expected the usual standard Superhero CGI Animated movie, but looking at the credits now and noticing people behind The Lego Movie wrote and produced it, it all started to make sense.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse could very well be the best Spider-Man movie ever! The animation was very stylish with mix of CGI and Comic-Book style art. This is a movie that did not take itself seriously at all, and with many different universes of Spider-Men it just went crazy and gave us a real packed 2 hours of entertainment. The use of music was decent, there was alot of heart to it, surprises, good gags, and it all felt fresh and interesting to the series.Overall, a real standout for Sony Pictures Animation and a very high bar set for Animated Superhero movies, giving other Animated movies a run for their money.8.5/10","

"Horst_In_Translation","1 July 2019","""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is an American animated movie from 2018, so still relatively new and fresh and actually this was the dominating film at awards ceremonies last year from the genre. It won the BAFTA, Golden Globe and eventually Oscar as well, not to mention managing a rare clean sweep for all its nominated categories at the Annie Awards. I will spare you the names of the many writers and directors here, as you can check them out for yourself, but the voice cast sure was spectacular. Lead actor Moore is not too famous and Johnson (who voices Peter Parker) is probably also only known to New Girl fans, but Steinfeld, Ali, Tomlin, maybe Pine and of course Nicholas Cage (Kick-Ass anybody?) should really be known to non-film buffs too. Maybe a few others as well. I mean there wasn't a voice performance that really stood out, but they were all rock-solid. Maybe American viewers will recognize them better. In terms of their voices. Or won't because they did such a great job.Let me say initially that I watched the version that runs for under 2 hours slightly and not the one that gets closer to the 2.5-hour mark. Still a fairly long movie for the animation genre. But it never feels that long, it rolls really smoothly thanks to a good story at its core, constant comedic delight and distraction, memorable characters as well as great attention to detail. There are only minor criticisms I have here. One would be that the father-son story struggled for a long time to really become as significant as they wanted it to be, even if right from the beginning there are solid comedic moments like when he takes him to school and says something like ""I love you"" in front of everybody and towards the end, it is also nice as well. Another, maybe my biggest, was that really how he developed his strengths and talents felt way too sudden. There should be a slow path to his craft where we see him struggle and fail with using his webs, his invisibility, his electric shocks etc. but it was fairly rushed. Oh yeah, and I was a bit confused Gwen Stacy was also the alternate universe Spider Man really. Or the part about his dad hating Spider-Man.So much for the negative, now for the positive: This film was looots of fun all in all. Many highly enjoyable sequences and those that did not do too much for me, like the big battle scene vs. Kingpin towards the end were at least visually on a truly high level. You can also see that the film does not take itself too seriously although it had the right to do so. Kingpin's looks are the best example. And then the 4(?) alternate universe Spider Mans. I mean the anime girl was so much fun and it was actually pretty sad when she lost her vehicle near the end and also to see how they were bonding with her and understood her pain. Film noir Spidey (Cage) was a lot of fun with his Rubik's Cube. Spider Woman was good too, even if the female character that impressed me more was Olivia Octavius, maybe also because of how surprising it was they went for a female version of her. In general, the film used many interesting references from the franchise, Green Goblin has a brief presence, Doc Ock is in it for longer. The losing one's uncle part is of course a memorable parallel and still I did not see it coming. I wonder who Spidey Pig lost. By the way, if you thought Spider Pig was already amazing in the Simpsons movie, then you will be amazed by this one here. Oh God he even is a cannibal as we see on one occasion, but he has really many fun moments.The film's wit and courage can be seen so many times. The best example is probably that Peter Parker dies early on in here and somewhat ironically, this is the moment when he really enters the movie (from another dimension) and is seen constantly on screen to be somewhat of a teacher, but more than that, actually more of a friend in fact to the one who is about to take PP's place in this new dimension. This crucial story point of Miles being bitten around the same time when Parker dies was one of the best things about the film. There again it is not a special moment or so, he just pushes the spider away as if it was nothing. Funnily enough this is when it all started when he was hanging around with his uncle, later on his enemy, but still beloved. The one thing missing here was perhaps Jonah Jameson or maybe he was also in it so brief that I missed him. I think not though.I already mentioned the great attention to detail. This applies to the moments when the film moves forward story-wise, but also these small moments, be it a hommage to Stan Lee that most Avengers movies can only dream of quality-wise, the most funny pig comment with the actual pig standing right next to them or just really minor things like talk about ""great expectations"" literature-wise vs. no expectations. No idea why I remembered this so closely. I think usually these films stand and fall with the main antagonist, but this is really more about becoming a hero and defeating the bad guy on the way. Kingpin is okay, but he never truly steals the show. Also interesting his own background story why he wants to open the portal to another dimension not knowing that even if he can get his wife and son back this way, they are still doomed, so everything is lost in any case for him. Now looking at the animation, it was good overall in terms of characters, pretty spectacular in terms of special effects on many occasions and to me it did look a bit like a video game in the calmer more restrained moments. By the way, most random snippet of information, there is also an actress names Morales in here. You could also think that there is more of a focus on ethnicity with the protagonist being a mix of Black and Hispanic, but there really isn't and I certainly liked that. No need to shove any forced messages into our face here and make a cringeworthy try-hard impact to fit in with the current political climate.Instead, the film elaborates on friendship and togetherness more than anything else and another great idea behind it all is that this film does not take place in the dimension where Peter Parker is key. Or at least not after he dies. It does not take place in the dimension where we live in, even if it feels this way sometimes. Now overall, a really good film and almost a must-see for animation lovers. It is definitely better than the very overrated Incredibles sequel from last year that did a lot wrong that this film here did right. I still think it is maybe not as outstanding as you could think from all the awards recognition it received and also if you take a look at the rating here on imdb. Sure, during its best moments it is better than 3 stars out of 5, but all in all, that sounds pretty accurate to me as the really big emotions they sometimes tried to go for weren't really evoked when it comes to my subjective perception. Also not by any definition the best animated movie of all time, which it was here on imdb for a while. It is pretty revolutionary with the idea of different dimensions and the execution, but Top10 is the limit I'd say. And it's not my favorite Spider-Man movie either. That would still be Maguire's first vs. Dafoe. Perhaps it is approximately on par with the sequel there. All, in all a positive recommendation with no hesitation, just don't expect true greatness.","

"nogodnomasters","5 March 2019","They recap the Spider-Man story and this was the universe where Emma Stone doesn't die. A super collider gathers Spider-people from multiple universes to defeat the bad guy. Miles gets bitten by a spider and get special abilities.Instead of saying quantum physics, they should be discussing string theory which would have made a better pun. Stan Lee is also in the cartoon as a store clerk. Would have made a great $300 million production, except the series with Thanos has prevented it. Cute for the kids.","

"Animated_Antic","18 December 2018","Spider-Man has gone through a lot in film, hasn't he? From the trilogy directed by Sam Raimi with Tobey Maguire, to Marc Webb's two Amazing Spider-Man films with Andrew Garfield, and being in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Tom Holland. He has really been through a lot. So if you took him as well as many different incarnations of the comic book character and put them into one movie, you'd get ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"". It may seem like a really crazy idea, but here it works. And it works phenomenally well. This is such an amazing animated movie and is also a breakthrough for new animation technologies. I haven't really seen a full length animated movie like this until now and it really is mind-blowing. This seriously is such an amazing movie.Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) is a teenager living in Brooklyn who is having a complicated life. He has been accepted into a new school despite not really wanting to go and is having a sort of difficult relationship with his parents (Luna Lauren Velez and Brian Tyree Henry). He does though bond closely to his uncle Aaron (Mahershala Ali) over his passion for graffiti. One night though, Miles is bitten by a radioactive spider and then starts to develop very strange powers. It doesn't stop there though. After seeing that Kingpin (Leiv Schreiber) has built a Super Collider in hopes to reconnect with his now deceased family, he then suddenly realizes that the portal has opened up other Spider-Men into his universe including Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson), Spider-Woman (Hailee Steinfeld), Spider-Man Noir (Nicholas Cage), Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn), and even an actual Spider Pig named Spider-Ham (John Mulaney). Together they must stop the Kingpin's plans of possibly destroying the world with his Super Collider and to get the other Spider-Men home before they glitch and eventually die. I would say more that happens, but I'd rather not spoil because you just need to see the film for yourself.Last year, I remember Sony Pictures Animation making their worst film to date with ""The Emoji Movie"". That film was boring, unoriginal, unfunny, painful to sit through, and clearly a product of corporate executive meddling. A year later, they have made their best film to date as it was captivating, funny, and a really thrill ride. For an animated comeback, this really is one of the best I've seen in years. It's clear the company is heading forward as a filmmaker driven studio which allows for more creator influences and ideas and less executive interferences and I'm very happy to see that. The story's main focus being on Miles getting the hang of his powers as well as the responsibility of taking on the role as Spider-Man is the highlight of the film. Seeing him growing as a character and getting through difficulties including struggling at this new school, trying to bond with his parents, and learning from the other Spider-Men characters is what makes the movie fantastic. It's what I expected to see from a superhero movie and I think it really delivered. As for the animation, it's incredible. This is probably the closest movie I've seen that looks like a comic book and it blends traditional animation and computer animation together really well. I've seen the technique dabbled with by Disney in shorts like ""Paperman"" and ""Feast"", but never have I seen a full length feature animated movie take on this style until now. Having seen it though, I can easily say I want more. This really is a game changer. The characters in this movie were the real highlight though. Although the character growth of Miles is the highlight of the movie, the other Spider-Men characters are all hilarious and stand out. Peter B. Parker and Spider-Woman are great teachers in a way to help Miles becoming who he is and Spider-Man Noir and Spider-Ham led to some of the funniest moments in the entire movie. I'm so glad they weren't in the trailers and I dare not say them here because they're so funny. This really was a fantastic animated movie, but I can say it's not flawless. For one, the dubstep like soundtrack did grate on me a bit and kind of got on my nerves. I prefer a full orchestra over dubstep any day. Also, I thought Kingpin could've been just a little bit better as a villain. I understood his motives and thought Schreiber did a fantastic job playing him, but I don't think he was quite as intimating and evil as I wanted him to be. He did come across as threatening, but he could've been just a tad bit more for me to legitimately fear. Still though, that's really it.""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is seriously a phenomenal animated movie with a great superhero story, fantastic and groundbreaking animation, and funny memorable characters to really hold it up. This really is such an achievement for Sony Pictures Animation and I'm so happy to see that they can really make a fantastic animated movie. I hope to see some more awesome movies like this in the future because this really did blow my mind.","

"kingsgrl2010","17 December 2018","This is one of the most ambitious movies ever created and it's one of the best animated films ever made.This movie is so vibrant, it feels like you are flipping through a comic book + the pages just leap right off. Everything in this was brilliant from the script, the colors, the casting, music and overall feel. I really love the inclusion of so many different ""spider-people"" you have Miles Morales, Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and even Spider-Ham. It just made the movie even that more fun.You don't need to watch any Spider-Man movies prior to seeing this, but if you have (or read the comics) it is loaded with cameo's and easter eggs. While this movie can look flashy and have a whole lot pumped into it, this is simply Miles' story, his journey, and a joy to watch.... Stan Lee also has the perfect send-off cameo (that I may have shed a tear at).oh, and also stay to the end of the credits for this one.
it's pretty great.","

"ethan-33027","22 December 2018","It's amazing!! Go watch it now!Honestly, it's one of the best movies I have watched this year. It has one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. It's just this good. It has great character, a simple but very compelling and interesting story and it's just a really good time. Miles was great. I loved his insecurities. It's a weird thing to say but the character feels very relatable and real. You feel his struggles and the pressure that he has to face in his life, with his parents, him releasing that his uncle is working for KingPin, living up to Peter Parker and Gwen and all the other spider people's expectations. You real feel for him. As for Peter Parker, I didn't like that they killed off Peter Parker from this universe at the start of the movie and then another version of Peter just comes up immediately after that. It kinda ruins the death and sadness a little. I would have liked it more if they had a couple more scene or maybe a one day jump before introducing the new spider man. But that's just me. After the Peter J. Parker, was introduced everything just kicked in from there. The whole sequence with Peter and Miles breaking in and out of that lab was wonderfully entertaining and Gwen's entrance couldn't be better. The other spider people introduced later were less useful aside from looking cool and having some memorable moments.Have I talked about the animation yet? it's freaking amazing and watching this actually inspired me to work on some of my art projects that I have been putting off. From the details of the sky scrapers to the reflections and the whole climatic battle scene at the end is just beautifully done and just really really good and satisfying to look at.Overall, the plot, the characters, the animation and the Stan Lee (oh, yes that was good too. Rest in peace Stan Lee, the line he delivered was also really funny and emotional as well) were just spectacular and amazing (see what I did there) and I definitely recommend this movie, even if you're not a Spiderman fan, watch it please. We need a sequel to for this movie. My hope on Sony has been restored.","

"cinemawithcj","6 December 2018","Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse makes you aware pretty early on you're in for something special. The curious project long in development unsure of where it sits in Spider-Man canon makes it known that it is the Spider-Man canon.It's a love letter to every single piece of Spider-Man you know and love and even the stuff you might not. The movies, the cartoons, the comics, the character, the icon. If you want a definitive Spider-Man, I think you're looking at it.Into The Spider-Verse oozes so much style from it you can't help but be sucked into its universe. The animation is slick and gorgeous and perfectly on form here, translating Spider-Man to the big screen like you've never seen before. It's beautiful and it's technically impressive, playing with all sorts of styles (helped by the diverse supporting characters) but never losing sight of its spirit.There's never been a more true comic adaptation. Watchmen is so far back in the mind alongside every other comic book movie here, Spider-Verse uses so many techniques in it you just feel everything you expect Spider-Man to actually be. It's like if Deadpool had those yellow boxes, or if Fantastic Four had a good movie.You feel so much love for Spider-Man in the making of this film, full of everything for the hardcore fan to the most casual movie-goer. Whatever your working knowledge of Spider-Man, you're going to be impressed.The actual story and characters haven't even been touched in this review so far and that's because Into The Spider-Verse gets the groundwork just so right of course everything falls into place. It subverts expectations, it gives you the exact payoffs you want, it has such smart humour and touching emotion. It's everything great about every Spider-Man piece of fiction and almost none of the flaws.Into The Spider-Verse surpasses even the likes of Spider-Man 2 here. It's not hammy (beyond Spider-Ham), it's not cheesy, it's not full of bad CG, it's not got soap-Opera antics that don't land, it's not set outside New York, it's none of those things.Spider-Man is reinvented alongside all the references of his reinvention. It gives us an origin story that doesn't suck, because it knows you know all of that. Several times over. It knows how smart the audience is. It knows we know the stories. The beats. So instead it gives us a show. It gives everything slightly different to what you know and expect, but leaves you happy with how familiar things are.The entire cast and crew have truly made something special. The writing, the directing, the animating, the acting, the soundtrack, everything. It shows the work that has gone into it. It stands apart from most of the other animated movies of recent years. It makes yet another good case for animation needing more of that mainstream blockbuster highlight. This is better than pretty much most of the superhero movies that have been made to date.Life has been breathed into Spider-Man yet again. And it's not necessarily gone bigger and better. It's human. It's funny. It's down to earth. It takes us on the journey Miles Morales is being taken on. Things get weird. Things get fun. An all star voice cast's praises can't be sung more. None of the people involved can't be celebrated more.There's great power given when you get the reins of Spider-Man. And with it comes great responsibility. Or however the saying goes. I'm just glad that I'm in the Spider-Verse were it all goes perfectly with this movie.","

"jg_1977","17 December 2018","Wow. That's the only word that I was able to articulate after being blown away by Spider-Verse. Normally I write my reviews as soon after seeing the movie as possible, however this time, I needed to give myself a few days to make sure I wasn't just riding the high that the movie leaves you on, and that it actually was as well-made as I thought. A few days later and my thoughts haven't changed. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is not only the best animated movie of the year, it's also the best superhero movie of the year (and this is coming from someone who loved both Black Panther and Infinity War), and simply one of the best movies of the year period (not to mention the best Spider Man movie of all time). This film succeeds in every conceivable way: it's got well-written, compelling characters that are brought to life by superlative acting; the visuals are stunning and create the most immersive theater experience of the year; the action is thrilling and never gets repetitive; the story manages to be both completely groundbreaking while also paying homage to the Spider Man story we know and love; and best of all, the comedy is absolutely spot on, every single joke lands without feeling cheap or getting old. As good as this movie is across the board, I suspect it all stemmed from an impressively written screenplay. Not surprisingly, Phil Lord (and an uncredited Chris Miller), truly understands what people enjoy and relate to in the Spider Man story and brings that to the screen beautifully. What's accessible about the character of Spider Man is that he (or she) is just a normal kid who gets these extraordinary powers and learns to become a superhero. As great a character as Iron Man is, it's pretty hard for a child to relate to the hard-drinking billionaire who happens to fight crime. Spider Man is relatable because he is a superhero every person can see themselves becoming in those circumstances. And that is the thesis of this film. Anyone can be Spider Man. The introduction of the Spider-Verse actually serves this message and enhances the story, which is what made the movie so enjoyable. At no point did the multi-verse concept feel like a device for selling toys (ahem... Porgs), but instead was a natural way to set up Miles Morales. There are only two things I could think of that could get criticized in Spider-Verse, the first is its inaccessibility to people who don't like Spider Man or superheroes, and the second is its visual style might not work for everyone. To address the first issue, I suspect there will be people who think this movie is only entertaining for people who already enjoy Spider Man properties, but I strongly disagree. Taking the Spider Man aspect out of this film, there's still a lot of great storytelling at work. Within this movie is a coming of age story about a black-hispanic kid trying to fit into his almost all-white high school, a story about a father trying to relate to his son, a story about a man who has given up on life who needs someone younger and more hopeful to show him the way, and a damn good science fiction story about a multi-verse. All of these narratives work without the superhero aspect, and I think make this film completely accessible to someone who has never seen a Spider Man movie before. The second issue about the visual style I understand a bit more, as initially the visuals didn't work for me. The style is shaky and imperfect and I felt like I was watching a 3-D movie without glasses. However, I realized they meant for the look to be imperfect and rough around the edges, just like worn out comic book come to life. I think part of the problem is that in recent years, with Pixar and Illumination movies, animation has gotten so refined and smooth, that is was at first off putting to see something break out of that mold. But after about 30 minutes, my eyes adjusted and I was able to get absorbed into the world they created. In summary, Spider-Verse is a mesmerizing movie that is firing on all cylinders and absolutely succeeds. It's funny, smart, heartfelt, with a message that makes me feel as hopeful and optimistic as I did when I was a kid seeing Toby Maguire become Spider Man for the first time. If you love Spider Man, you will 100% eat this movie up, and if you don't already love the wall-crawling hero, you will by the end of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Go see this movie!","

"alcantaraj-16594","23 February 2019","First, this movie is fantastic! I would dare say that ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is perfect. There were no dull moments whatsoever.Second, the animation is breathtakingly gorgeous.Third, the twists, story, characters and direction were all flawless.Lastly, this movie is better than ""Incredibles 2"" and ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" which is why it would be a crime against filmmaking if it loses to either one of those two for the Academy Awards' Best Animated Feature!EDIT: (FEB 25, 2019)IT DESERVEDLY WON!","

"paul-allaer","24 December 2018","""Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse"" (2018 release; 117 min.) is the latest version of the Peter Parker /Spiderman story. After a clever opening montage with the Columbia/Sony/Marvel logos, Spiderman introduces himself to the audience: ""There is only one Spiderman, and I'm it!"". We then get to know Miles Morales, a teenager who admires Spiderman, and does not like attending school at the elite Brooklyn Visions Academy. His dad is a cop at the NYPD, and does not care much for Spiderman. One day Miles visits his freewheeling uncle, and while Miles is working on mural art, he is bitten by a spider. He wakes up the next day having grown taller overnight, and with a lower voice, and with strange powers. Could there be more than one Spiderman? At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: when a movie requires not one, not two, but three directors, it typically is a very bad sign, but in this case it turns out to be the exact opposite. Among the never-ending stream of comic book heroes live action fare, often with dubious quality (this week's Aquaman looks particularly bad), here comes a computer-animated film that has been freed from live-action shackles, and as a result is the freshest offering in the comic book superhero movies in a long time. The animation is dazzling, the characters are in-depth, the story line is complex and engaging. When I saw the movie's end credits, I saw all these big names for the voices (Nicolas Cage, Hailee Steinfeld, Lily Tomlin, Zoe Kravitz, Liev Schreiber, etc.). Truth be told, I hadn't recognized a single of them as the movie was playing. Look out for a cameo appearance from Stan Lee himself (sadly he passed away just weeks before this movie came out). Bottom line: ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider=Verse"" shows the way how, for me, comic books should get the big screen treatment. Can't wait for the sequel and apparent spin-offs (yes, plural!).""Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse"" was released wide on December 14, with tremendous positive buzz and critical acclaim. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely, with lots of families and kids ""from age 7 to 77"". If you are curious whether the film is as good as people say it is, I readily suggest you check it out, be it in theaters (for maximum visual impact), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","

"torrerossano","14 December 2018","So, I hesitate to say that this is the best movie I have ever seen, for several reasons, but I want people to take this review seriously, so I will just say it is every bit as good as any movie I have ever seen.I had high expectations for this movie, I love animated movies, I LOVE Spider-Man, and Jake Johnson is fantastic, and yet this movie still blew me away. The best thing I can say about this movie is that I had a smile on my face from start to finish. It was moving, relatable, funny, and the animation style may completely change the game for the entire genre.Add in the top-notch voice acting (Chris Pine, AWESOME). I loved it, I really did. I hope you will too.","

I was in awe and I wished every 5 min they would pause the movie so I can relish the artistry! This is the way you make a anime movie in 16k! Of course movie theaters can only do 2k and amc has thier digital 4k theater across the country. Eventually theaters will evolve into 8k and life will change. This is a must see but a warning for those with epelypsie syndrome this action adventure can produce flashes and fast moving dizziness so be prepared when you watch this amazing movie.","

The movie just seemed to do everything right for me and I can't think of any flaws or really anything I have wrong with it, it's practically a flawless Spider-Man movie and the best comic book film of the year alongside Infinity War and also the best animated movie of the year and one of the best of the decade.All the characters were very refreshing and a much needed change from previous comic book films and the humour and storytelling in it was just so fresh and entertaining. It was fun, creative, original and also very funny. I thought it was groundbreaking and is my favourite film of the year","

"Eclectic-Boogaloo","12 February 2020","I wasn't able to make it through the first hour of this movie. First of all - it's a beautiful looking film, one of the best looking animated films I've ever seen. And I also liked most of Lord & Miller's quips. It's pretty funny.My first problem was that the movie's opening 45 minutes were a cringey diversity checklist (and this is coming from a minority). At least make the introduction of all the characters organic for god's sake. Spider Gwen's intro was one of the most obvious in the history of comic book movies.Another even larger problem was that the constant interjection of jokes and quips undermined every single bit of drama that there was to be had. I like jokes just as much as the next person but once in a while just let the drama build. Is that too hard? There doesn't have to be a joke every single minute. This was like a Marvel movie on steroids in the absolute worst way. Very disappointing.","

"donaldricco","2 September 2019","Lots of positives in this - attention to detail, the six (well, 5 for me) alternate Spideys, and the quality of the animation! Loved Spider-Gwen and Spider-Ham! And I really liked how Spider-Man Noir looked! Super cool! (plus, it was amazing that Nicolas Cage didn't ruin it! I guess NOT seeing him makes him betterish!) I liked the name Peni Parker, but I don't like anime at all, so I could have done without her completely.
Negatives - fight scenes were boringly too long! WAAAAAY too long! And everything having to do with the machine thing was boring, lame, stupid, confusing, etc. Yes, it got all those Spideys ""here"", but it was a terrible plot point. And the fight at the end with the machine? It's length and pointlessness almost made me shut off the disc. Seriously, how long was it? 20 minutes? So, so bad.But if/when I re-watch this, I'll fast-forward those scenes, and probably have a 4, 4 1/2 star watch! And a much more compact movie!","

"Artylo","28 August 2019","To preface this review, one ought to know that review will not be from the perspective of an avid superhero aficionado but rather from a viewpoint of one with little to no exposure when it comes to the Spider-Man comic books, graphic novels or anything besides the Sam Raimi film trilogy and the 1994 animated series for that matter. As such, there won't really be any discussion as to the quality of adaptation when it comes to characters and how they relate to existing plot lines as compared to those of the film; however, to compensate, that would contribute to a more objective viewing of the picture on its own merits. Also of note, the film was viewed in 2D through the digital home release and not the 3D version in theatres.Of course, there is no denying that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one of the most aesthetically impressive animated features of quite some time. Everything from the models, to the lighting, to the shading is made with immense artistry and lends itself nicely to the diegesis of what an animated comic book would look like if one were to exist inside it. While the animation itself has its flaws in terms in terms of consistency, there was a noticeable and considerable effort put into the use of shaders in effects such as chromatic aberration, the simulation of halftone patterns in the flares of lighting and hatching instead of flat colour shading; while the animation makes use of some classical techniques, such as squashing and stretching movement, shifting between 3D and 2D through rotoscoping, and motion smearing. One could point to the visual fidelity of the film as its strongest asset - and it most definitely is; however, one could easily gloss over some of the inconsistencies, owing themselves to the bewildering amount of framerates at play in some of the scenes. The production company behind the animation process cites a variation from 24 to 14 frames per second, which some have attributed as a stylistic choice to represent a form of character development throughout the plot as movement becomes less bold and more fluid along the hero's journey. However, on first viewing, the initial minutes of the film's runtime were quite the eyesore, requiring some adjustment before being able to completely immerse oneself in the experience. Human vision still processes images individually at around the 10 to 12 mark and even if these 14 frames of animation are done ""on twos"", it feels like a slideshow most of the time. What especially makes this jarring is that two characters can be animated using two different framerates in the same scene, which would usually be a massive red flag.One other contentious aspect of the film is its music. The influence of the east coast hip-hop culture is written into the DNA of the protagonist and the film's setting, and the soundtrack reflects that by making liberal use of licensed music, featuring heavy breakbeats with an electronic flair. Daniel Pemberton's score is a more classical offering, mixing orchestral and synthesized sounds to elevate moments of humor or tragedy, but taking influence from 70's funk, as well as more eastern or ragtime infused bits from different styles of animation. The main failing of the soundtrack is the use of the aforementioned licensed tracks, as they usually play over dialogue. These tracks, coming from a style of music which values quick and high tempo vocals doesn't match with the slower more narrative pace of the underlying dialogue and ends up overpowering it, making the dialogue hard to hear. The instrumental score makes great use of leitmotifs and gives every character their own theme with about 2-3 variations, which usually get played with good timing in moments of distress, surprise or in the many comedic points throughout the film, and it usually made more of an impression than the licensed tracks that just seemingly bound the main character to a stereotype more than anything.The main weak point of the film is perhaps its plot development. To be brief, the film has too many characters to sufficiently develop any of them into anything more than a single archetype with slight variations. Even in the script (now available publicly), once can notice the emphasis on allusions to pop culture tropes and internet memes as a nod to veteran fans of the series, rather than an attempt to establish something more meaningful. In its defense, it does make strides on being free of the now clichéd origin story of Spider-Man, however it also makes a point to repeat it three more times than usual, rendering the whole effort of being brief and self-aware pointless, as it would have taken up about the same runtime as just going through with it in its entirety in the first place.The events of the film take place in two days in their entirety, including massive character-defining shifts in confidence, ability and skill as well as long term relationships forming over a mere few hours. In the end this makes any growth from any character appear as if they embody a Marry Sue/Larry Stu archetype, who develops whatever the plot requires to progress almost instantly. Tragedies take place, which feel like obvious tear-jerker moments for characters we've merely known for a whole 10 minutes, seemingly requiring at least some familiarity of the source material or a long term devotion to the series as a fan to grasp the severity of their plight. Alongside that, characters appear in and out of places at the plot's convenience, ruining any idea of continuity, especially near the end. Even so, the relationships between the characters only have an effect in the aftermath of the main conflict, uninfluenced by everything that has happened, as if these paradigm shifts in their personal lives were going to happen regardless of their presence in the events of the film. No one ever really grows in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse; the closest thing being an equivalent to a B-plot of a parent drifting away from their child, which ultimately gets played for laughs.The screenplay follows The Hero's journey to the last letter, only differing in the many references it makes to other properties of the Spider-Man franchise, which show up sporadically throughout the events of the film. Even the idea of the ""Mentor"" is present, but effectively thrown out of the window, since the trials and failures, the growth of new skills and the death and rebirth of the main protagonist happen in one single scene, skipping an entire essential quarter of the journey.Everything in the plot moves with such haste that it has no time to go anywhere. By the halfway point of the film's runtime it is still tying up the loose ends of its inciting incident. As said before, it has too many characters that get introduced too quickly and in bulk. Drama is experienced and is immediately forgotten, since there is no time to dwell upon it. Motives are not questioned and are washed away.Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a shining display of the skills of the talented artists and animators who worked on it, but they are used on a film with little to no direction, except for repeating the same clichés it aims to subvert in a franchise that is already becoming oversaturated by its own offerings in an attempt to reinvent itself for a modern audience, relying purely on fan-service and relatable pop culture references. It boasts a colourful cast of characters which it spends little to no time developing due to the haste with which the plot moves in an incredibly small timeframe of events. Ultimately, an experience that is pleasing to the eye with its skillful execution, but vapid in substance due to poor screenwriting choices. Nothing more than another origin story.","

"Russoguru","9 December 2019","The first time I saw Into the Spiderverse... no kidding, I walked out. I freaking hated it. I didn't care for Miles Morales and his stupid uninteresting family dynamic BS between him and his felonious uncle, I didn't care for the ugly, choppy looking animation, nor did I like the stupid, overly cartoony ridiculously goofy tone. I don't care that this movie has all the spidermen in it, by the time all these other guys start showing up... it's too little... WAY too late.I watched it again recently and sigh... I still hated it. Seriously, I freaking despised this movie. Why people love this movie is beyond me... and yet... it won the OSCAR for best animated feature!!!! Slow year for animated films maybe?Well, maybe, or MAYBE I'm just missing something. I just find absolutely nothing of redeeming value whatsoever in Into the Spiderverse. You've got to also bear in mind I LOVE the MCU Spiderman. I think Spiderman Homecoming and Spiderman Far From Home are really good movies. It's just very difficult for me to take this movie seriously when it's so overwhelmingly goofy. I think that's my problem.And yet... kids and adults alike SOMEHOW like this movie! So maybe I am missing something, and maybe I should concede that this just isn't a movie for me. I didn't like it at all, but hey I guess chances are you and your kids will.","

"hobgoblinlol","2 May 2019","Didn't really care for the film when it was first announced mostly because of the odd looking animation and the character Miles Morales, who I'm not a fan of, in this case screamed ""Look! black Spider-Man gets his own movie now!"" all over. But after the overwhelming praise this film got, it's every detail from animation to story-telling receiving colossal praise, I had to see it.With all the hype, I thought I was gonna watch a masterpiece that would blow me away and boy, was I wrong. The only thing I enjoyed about this film were some dialogues from classic Spider-Man and noir, Miles felt extremely generic, another story of how someone who isn't talented or capable at first BUT gets better because he ""believes in himself."" of course. The villains in this are just so bad. We have one villain for a simple emotional twist, throw away villains like the FEMALE Doc Ock, Tombstone and Scorpion. And Kingpin another attempt with the overused ""sympathetic villain"" trope who's design is absolutely horrendous, it literally looks like his head is attached to his chest, they could have at least given him his classic white suit which they of course didn't. The plot is extremely generic and predictable, it has some decent moments but overall nothing memorable. Don't get me started on the god awful soundtrack.My main problem with this film is the PC, SJW, diversity angle. It's just extremely conspicuous how there's such a HUGE amount of colored people even at a prestigious school that according to liberals are filled with the white privileged elite, it's just so ironic at this point. Even the villains. Either my standards are too high or everyone else's have lowered drastically. I love being proven wrong, I had low expectations when seeing Logan and John Wick 2 and I ended up loving those films. Either this movie is for a certain demographic of specific age or I'm one of the few insane people that think it's extremely overrated. Spider-Man 3 was at least entertaining, this is above everything is just boring.","

"MJL_Uncensored","18 December 2018","Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse is Sony's latest attempt to cash in on their license to Marvel's Spider-man franchise (like Venom), is one of the best non-MCU affiliated endeavors Sony has ever produced. While Venom was a refreshing update to the character's origin story, after the disastrous outing in Spider-man 3, it still lacked the presence of his most crucial adversary-Spider-man. With the infectiously fun Tom Holland's take on the web crawler side-lined till 2019, Sony needed to keep their only superhero franchise in the public sphere. However, this time, they took the bold step of animating the Spider-man franchise with a story centered around his multiverse doppelganger-Miles Morales.For those who are unfamiliar with Miles, he's an Afro-Latino character introduced in the comics world in 2011 as Marvel experimented with shedding their homogenous base and reached out to attract readers of all cultures. In Spiderman-Homecoming, he's briefly mentioned by Donald Glover's modest take on The Prowler. He even appears in Sony's newest PS4 Spider-man game, so the ground was tilled in advance of his arrival. Moreover, his appearance is nothing short of spectacular.Miles is a charming teenager with loving parents who are willing to send him away to ensure he receives a world-class education and the best chance at success in a dangerous world. He is the by-product of Gen-X age parents who were reared the same way. When he discovers his powers after the all-to-familiar radioactive spider bite, he has a chance encounter with the real Spider-man and soon has his entire world torn apart (literally) when an experiment by King Pin sucks multiple versions of Spider-man, into Miles reality. These multiverse Spider-people include two female versions of the acclaimed hero, two additional male versions, and a Looney Toons inspired pig version. It sounds like a recipe for disaster narratively. Surprisingly, the story works amazingly well. Moreover, that's not the only thing that works well in this film.
Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse blends the beauty of 3-D animation with the stylized look of ink to paper art. The union creates a fascinating phantasmagoria of lucid animation that will leave you in awe of its quality for the first half of the movie. When you're done being mesmerized by that, there's still room on your plate for a heartfelt story about friendship, discovering one's purpose and the love of family - all the things you've come to expect from this franchise. There's enough heart in this movie to make you care about the stakes in this film-which are felt early on and repeated later in the movie to remind you that this isn't a rated-G film.Now, it would be irresponsible to ignore Stan Lee's overriding message that the diversity of the Spiderverse (or Marvel in general) is a good thing in an era of diversity resistance. Miles parrots this, and so do all the other versions of Spider-man. Moreover, it's true. There's enough room in this world for multiple versions of this superhuman and we should all welcome updated take on the character when they're done this well.This film is a dazzling display of style and story. The tongue in cheek narration finds a way to celebrate the ups and downs of the Toby McGuire & Andrew Garfield Spiderman eras. Also, it's as much of a nod to the past as it is a celebration of the future of this franchise. Now, if Sony can find a way to make its villains as intense as they were in this movie-in their live-action films-they will be able to milk the franchise for all it's worth.","

"thebricks","19 December 2018","Saw this today thanks to AMC's A-List. It was truly awful. I fell asleep and when I woke up, Miles formed some sort of Spiderman team with some Japanese girl in a suit, Spiderman Noir(?), Spider Pig, who I actually remembered from the nineties and some other characters. This was just absolutely weird. This movie was just all over the place, I don't think Marvel could possibly have had anything to do with this mess unlike Spiderman Homecoming. I'm at a loss as to why Sony has problems making a decent Spiderman/Venom movie. Yes, I know Venom did well, but let's be honest, people only went because Homecoming was so good, so they thought Venom would be as well. They didn't know Marvel wasn't allowed to have any say on that film though, sadly.Thanks for wasting 2 hours of my time. Don't waste yours.","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","16 December 2018","Just because 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)' is animated doesn't mean it's a 'kids' film. Here, the danger is always real, with the stakes never being anything less than (on-screen) death, and the experience is all the more exciting for it. Don't get me wrong, it's not overly grim; if you, or your children, have seen any of the web-head's previous films, you're probably good to go. This one is essentially everything you could want from a 'Spider-Man' story, an accessible yet comic-conscious blast from beginning to end. It really is an incredibly entertaining time, a joy of a movie that pretty much just gets better and better as it goes along. It manages to expertly mask its more conventional (though, as yet untold) 'origin story' elements behind its bolder and more unique 'multi-verse' motifs. You usually don't know what it's doing until it has just done it, even if what it has just done is the most by-the-numbers superhero plot-point you could possibly imagine, which makes for a refreshing, constantly original and highly enjoyable thrill-ride that's easily up there with the best of its genre. On top of all that, its phenomenal animation is literally groundbreaking, a unique blend of 3D and 2D that expertly evokes a 'comic-book' look. Because of this, as well as its quick pace, it's potentially the most lively and energetic film I've ever seen. It's amazing. Plus, it has one of the, if not the, best post-credits scenes of recent memory, one that not only bookends the piece with a relatively subtle yet still intriguing tease for the possible future of the franchise but also with the feature's best joke. It's a fantastic, genuinely funny note on which to end. 9/10","

"joexrayguy","16 December 2018","Absolutely spot on. Respects the history of the characters and story, but has a totally new fresh look. Visually amazing, its hard to absorb EVERYTHING that is going on on screen. I did have to go,out and make sure I wasnt in the 3D theater; some of the background items have a double outline that gave the impression of a 3D projection. I found out this was a production choice and I was in the right place. I think the way to tell a perfect melding of voice acting and production is when you look at the character onscreen and think ""Wow, they're really giving a great performance"" then realize, it's a cartoon, not a person in n the screen. You've been drawn in...they did their jobs well. Nice tributes to Ditko and Lee can be seen.","

I have never seen an animated movie that mixes together 4 entirely different art style so well. Sony has truly produced a masterpiece. When we talk about comic book movies, we too often think of everything that MARVEL has produced in the past 10 years, but into the spider-verse reveal to us what a comic book movie can be and should be. This is a movie that's special as it is.","

"Animany94","19 December 2018","I admit it, I was a little sceptical about this movie knowing the history and reputation of Sony Animation and after I watched their live-action departent butcher the character of Venom in theaters earlier this year.But this was a stunning expirience! The company that gave us garbage like The Emoji Movie actually cared this time and stepped up their game.First of all, the animation was fantastic with lots of vibrant colours and an overall comic book feel to it unfolding when Miles Morales is discovering his new identity as his dimension's Spider-Man. Your eyes will be glued to the screen when this riot of animation gets going.We also get a well paced coming-of-age story of Miles Morales which is filled with lots of real-life struggles which makes him so relatable just like Spider-Man is supposed to be. I was so happy seeing a portrayal of him which understood his comic book character. The writers definitely knew about certain misinterpretations in the past.Even though not every character has a ton of development put into them, they still manage to make them work to serve the story. They get to tell a brief origin story just to make clear to non-Spider-Man viewers who we're dealing with. And the Spider-Man team is just so loveable and make great dynamics off of each other while they still keep both feet on the ground knowing how serious the situation is.And wait for the climax which is super intense and showcases animation's full potential in creating art and entertainment.A good coming-of-age story with amazing animation and intense action scenes that will blow your mind!","

I am 45 years old, probably too old for animation movies, however i saw those astonishing reviews and i thought, why not, let's give it a try. During the first 30 minutes it was like another reviewer mentioned, ""just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman"", i didn't love it but it was not bad so i kept watching. To my surprise, this was getting better and better. Suddenly, i was hooked. And the last 30 minutes were amazing, i had goosebumps, i felt like i was feeling when i was younger watching movies like MATRIX, almost same excitement.I can't rate it higher because i didn't love the first half. First half was crucial though, in order for the events of the second half to happen. Sorry for my bad English, i mean this was a well structured movie and everything is happening for a reason here.I watched immediately after the ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE. Yes, this is a trioumph.","

The traditional 2D animation mixed in with computer animation and cell shading technique is something that you have possibly never seen before.
The story is easy to follow because they explain it as the movie goes along, so you do NOT have to know about the comic books or much about this particular version of Spider-man.
Do yourself a favor and try to see this on a big screen such as IMAX. I saw it in 3-D and I can say it does add to the experience.
This movie is definitely in the running for not just best animated movie, but best movie of the year.","

The final act alone is worth the price of admission and again one of those very rare instances where 3D is not a gimmick but actually enhances the pleasure of the experience and has meaning to the film.","

"eparazak","15 December 2018","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is the latest movies from Sony Picture Animation and is about the coming of age of Miles Morales, the next Spiderman. After getting bitten by a radioactive spider, he gains the powers of Spiderman and after a run-in with Kingpin, he meets Spiderman variations from different universes and needs to work together to stop him from ending the universe.2018 has been a large year for superhero films and I gotta admit I was excited for this one, mostly because of the animation style. When that's taken out, I really enjoyed this movie. The animation's style looks like a 3D version of a literal superhero comic book, and the pacing makes it feel like one too. The action is fast-paced, crisp and it really made me wonder what was going to happen next. That alone makes this film stand out from any other mainstream animated movie, which feels really refreshing.Aside from that, I enjoyed the company of every protagonist. Every Spiderman variation has a different charm to them that makes each one memorable. Take the main character Miles, who has to come to terms with accepting his father's wishes in being a better person by not looking up to his uncle instead. I think that arc was handled really well. I could go deeper into come of the other characters, but that would spoil parts of the movie.If I were to name a couple small issues with the movie, I do think it contains a weakness that most good Marvel movies share and that's a good villain. Kingpin for the most part felt pretty generic and didn't seem to have much character going for him. Aside from that, I do wish they could've gone more in-depth with Miles' relationship with his father. I have no problem with the execution of it, but I would've like to have seen more.Despite this, I highly recommend seeing this for superhero movie fans, comic book fans and animation fans. It's got amazing animation, great characters, an engaging story and lots of heart.9/10","

"Tivanboven","22 December 2018","In the midst of all the raving reviews, I almost feel like a fraud giving this film such a high score. However, for me personally, this does what it needs to do and more. Let it be known that I used to watch the Spider-Man cartoon in the 90s nearly every day so yes, I am influenced by nostalgia.Animation
I don't think that a lot of people can deny that this is the most interesting, dynamic and artistic animation which stays true to the original medium yet. When I first saw the comic book text and thought bubbles in the trailer, it kind of put me off a little bit, but it wasn't used throughout the film, only to depict Miles' newly developed awareness. I can see how the neon colours can induce headaches for some, but to me it was perfect. Maybe take an aspirin before going in if you're probe to headaches!Story
There are so many things to love! Granted, I'm not a comic book reader (contemplating to get into that thanks to this though) so all of the stories were fresh to me. I loved that (big spoilers ahead!) Miles' universe's Peter Parker actually dies in the first act. This gives great motivation to an otherwise uninterested Miles, shows the need for a vigilante, stars Miles' dad's character arc, shows the danger that Kingpin poses, allows for aunt May to show her strong side (nice change of pace from the classic worried old lady) among others. Even Kingpin's motivation can be sympathised with. I agree that the other henchmen, who are normally fully fledged bad guys, could get some more backstory though. However, for veterans of the series, the fanservice is gold. (Did anyone else get excited when doctor Olivia revealed her last name?)All in all I'd say that this is a masterpiece. But does it still the hunger for any other rendition of Spider-Man? No, so -1 point there.","

"varun-25071997","20 February 2019","Conceptually its brilliant but like every other superhero movie, there are way too much unnecessary action scenes which ruins the 2nd hour of the movie. Its visually stunning for an animation film and manages to be lively throughout by mixing humor and action like the Homecoming movie. But too often the characters are left under developed like the Spiderman Noir which really was disappointing because I was looking forward for Nicolas Cage. The soundtrack was fine and the song placements were perfect and as for the casting goes its very diverse and is a good representation for BAME. Overall its an interesting film with a great post credit scene but the major drawbacks are excessive action and a basic 3rd act.","

"dbrown-74306","21 December 2018","I had my doubts when Sony said they they were making a new cartoon Spider-Man movie, considering their last outing was the Emjoi Movie.
The trailer displayed the artwork pretty well, but still I didn't want to get my hopes up. The reviews made it sound like the best Spiderman movie ever. So I went to the movie theater and watched it with my brother. And I was, in short absolutely captivated.Miles Morales is a teen protege growing up in Brooklyn with a hard nosed cop for a dad, a loving mother and an uncle, Aaron who helps him explore his ambition as a graffiti artist. The problem is the new school he goes to isn't the life he's looking for, and he is doing all he can to get out of it, against his family's wishes.But that all changes when he meets three people: a girl in his class named Gwen Stacy, a 26 year old blonde guy named Peter Parker and a radioactive spider.Because of a portal opened by Wilson Fisk, the dna of. Spider-Man attracts in alternate Spider-Ma.... i mean Spider-People, dragging them all into Miles' Brooklyn neighborhood. It's up to them, including a middle aged and cynical Peter, Spider-Woman, Spider- pig, and a depressed and grungy Spider-Man Noir, to stop Kingpin from using the portal again to rip a hole in the space time continuum.But that being said, that doesn't touch a bit on how hilarious, how heart breaking, and how endearing the scenes can be moment by moment. The animation and concept art go hand in hand, and gives the film a high tech, pop art appeal like nothing the world has ever seen at this scale or skill. Words can't describe the way this movie moves and feels like the best comic book ever written.I can't recommend this enough. Go watch this movie right now and you will not be disappointed But don't watch it if you have epilepsy or anything like that. It gets pretty flashy.","

"Benslie","15 December 2018","First of all, I love the animation style in this film. The animation in this film is styled to look like an actual comic book. I think this approach for this kind of film was an excellent choice because we've all seen the usual kind of animation but nothing like this. To tie in with the animation I need to talk about the action scenes in this film. These tie in with the animation because of the way the directors styled the action shots is to look like something in a comic panel. Most people don't know who Miles Morales is and after this film, you'll want to learn more about him because of how they made him so relatable in this film. He acts like a typical teen in this situation compared to other versions of Spider-Man. Other versions kind of just acted like they always knew how to use their powers when Miles struggles with his. Miles isn't the only relatable character film all of them are. The creators of this film did a ""Marvel""ous job at making each character in this film somebody at least one person in the audience can relate to. All of the voice actors did a great job in their respected roles but it would've been nice to have a returning voice to at least one of the Spider-Man. It would've been cool to hear a returning voice even if it was for a few seconds. I have to talk about the humour in this film. It isn't overpowered in this film and I felt like it had just the right amount of humour that will make everybody laugh. They poke fun of things that wouldn't make sense in a real movie and other Spider-Man movies. Not a single moment in this film felt rushed or slowed down every scene felt the right pace for a movie like this. The cinematography in this movie was spectacular. This is probably because of it looking like a comic book and how the lighting needs to match up with how it would look in an actual book. If you are a comic book junkie you'll love all of the easter eggs in this film. Some of them just comic book readers will get but others a majority of people will understand. The music in this film is fantastic. Every song in this film isn't overused and matches perfectly with the age of the character. Somebody Miles age would be listening to the type of music he listens to. And the music without lyrics helps increase the emotion in the film. Also, there are two end credit scenes that are worth waiting for. In the end, this film is perfect for everybody.","

"themadmovieman","6 December 2018","This is a genuinely exceptional film. Away from the world of the big-budget, mainstream comic book movies, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse breaks boundaries with a stunningly original and fresh take on the classic superhero tale, combining hilarious self-referential humour with an equally thrilling story, all topped off with spellbinding visuals from beginning to end.There's nowhere we can start from but the film's stunning animation. With clear love and passion for all things superhero poured into every single frame of Into The Spider-Verse, the film sings with its mesmerising comic-book style visuals, bordering on the edge of a kind of gritty stop-motion that blends seamlessly with individual panels, captions and even the odd THWACK or BIFF that pops up on the screen.But not only does this film bring comic books to life on the big screen like never before, because it also has a stunning and vivid urban vibe throughout that adds to the atmosphere and excitement of the whole affair. Again blurring the lines between gritty urban visuals and psychedelic, kaleidoscopic colours, the film is a dazzling watch, with cinematography that pops in hugely entertaining fashion throughout, adding to the jaw-droppingly good-looking nature of the film, all the while furthering its unique and distinct atmosphere.And that's the next thing I want to touch on, because although Into The Spider-Verse does centre on a big Marvel character, what makes it feel so fresh is that unique atmosphere. Of course, the visuals are integral in that, but there's something deeper that comes from the film's brilliant screenplay and passionate directing. Landing us in a parallel version of New York City, the movie has the opportunity to play with things we know and love, and give them an original twist to help set the foundations of this world apart from the mainstream comic book movies.As a result, this film completely breaks the rule book when it comes to modern superhero movies - surpassing even the likes of Deadpool with its originality - with a gleefully fun and playful take on comic book tropes and clichés, all the while still surging with an immensely exciting blockbuster plot that feels pleasantly familiar, but just different enough.So that means that you can enjoy Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse in a number of different ways, whether it be as a straight comic book blockbuster akin to the MCU and DCEU, a fresh and exciting urban thriller, a visual masterpiece filled with a kaleidoscope of colours, or even a flat-out hilarious comedy. There are few movies in the genre with that degree of diversity within, but it's that very fact that makes it such a stunning watch throughout, leaving you barely a minute to breathe as it enthralls you from every single angle.Finally, a mention about the film's comedy, which is absolutely amazing from beginning to end. It's a laugh-a-minute rollercoaster of a movie, with both well-written and character-driven humour throughout, as well as fantastically tongue-in-cheek, self-referential humour, doing for Spider-Man what Warner Bros.' hilarious The Lego Batman Movie did for the Caped Crusader, and a whole lot of winks and nods to modern superhero movies that are sure to have fans laughing on a near-constant basis.Overall, then, I was blown away by Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse. For a film that seems so small at first, it's actually one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen, breaking out on its own in brilliantly unique fashion with an absolutely mesmerising visual template, a thoroughly exciting and original story, a passionate and tangible urban atmosphere, and utterly hilarious comedy from start to finish.","

Now, I'm not a comic book fan, nor an MCU fan although I've enjoyed a few, especially ""Spider-Man Homecoming,"" which I loved as I'm a sucker for those teenage, coming of age tales. The animation style was lovely in this movie but, the plot was humdrum and there was little character development and none of the witty repartee that is such a hallmark of the best animated films that appeal to both children and adults. This should have focused on Miles Morales getting a disillusioned Peter Parker to train him and get his mojo back. THe other iterations of Spider-Man were unnecessary. This was truly little more than a mediocre kids' animated movie. The small audience in my Friday morning theater was exclusively adult and there was little reaction from the audience throughout. Sitting in the Dolby theater, with the recliner in use, I actually thought about taking a snooze at least a couple of times during the movie.","

"donepudisrikar","20 December 2018","We all grew up with Spiderman, mine was Raimi's blockbuster trilogy. This film not only nods to those Masterpieces but gives us more. It was crazy to see the Spiderman PS4 suit in there along with the post credits scene throwing us way back to the comics. Also everytime nicholas cage spoke it was basically greatness (greatness awaits?)The plot while not complicated was well executed using fantastically funny internal monologues, well painted backstories, and of course beautiful action sequences which contain a crazy amount of Easter eggs btw! A Spiderverse shows the many shades of Spiderman, inspiring us as well to find our shade and take that leap of faith. I guess we are indeed Spiderman, Stan Lee. This movie makes you REALLY feel like spiderman.The one con I had with the movie was that while the movie didn't want to become another Peter Parker joint, Peters arc took up a significant amount of the time taking away from the other spider people (&pig). Maybe the movie could have been longer to use the others to strengthen Miles' arc into an even more explosive finale.","

The movie is also very impactful of the drama (watch out Disney Sony is coming) what I liked about this movie is for the cultures of different people in this movie (Go Hispanics/african Americans and Japanese people). The different Spiderman/women even thought I know who they were but it was fun to see them in a short easy version of explaining their backstory in a very short time. The drama which is awesome ,which beats all the Spiderman movies on drama. This One is the king of Spiderman movies aside the Tobey Maguire trilogy and Andrew Garfield movies. This is by far the most ambitious to make the different art styles for each character and how they show New York in this version.

"forpassord","27 December 2021","I have heard a lot about how great the animation in this movie is supposed to be... Yes, it is different, but I can not see anything about it that is better. Rather the opposite: The animation seemed simple, grainy and with some stuttering and strange coloring at times. So NO: Different is NOT necessarily the same as better... Mixing anime and the cartoon style in this movie just clashed. Together with the style at the end of the movie that looked like the animators were drugged on hallucinogens made the animation messy and inconsistent.In addition to the animation, this move continues the idiotic trends these days with distorting superheroes into something COMPLETELY different instead of creating new characters, and thereby cannibalizing on the established characters! I have no problems what so ever with female superheroes (I LOVED ""Wonder Woman"" (2017) for example), or super heroes with other skin colors than white (like The Hulk ;-) (PS: That was a JOKE...!), and I liked Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon for example), but I HATE when an established character is turned into something completely different in stead of creating a NEW character!!! A third trend that I dislike these days are children/teenagers that take over and saves the day when experienced adults are unable to.The anime girl and her robot, and the Disneyesque/Simpsonesque ""Spider-Pig was just malplaced in this movie and idiotic!As mentioned earlier: The animation towards the end is just a mess and looks like a hallucination! And the sequence after the end credits was just idiotic. There are several reasons for why that kind of acting/dialogues no longer are in movies, animated or otherwise. People behind this movie should have stuck to making Lego movies for children.In the end: If you like the devolution of Sider Man into the childish character in the most recent Spider-Man movies with Tom Holland, I suspect that you will like this movie. But if you, as I do prefer Spider-Man as an adult as in the movies with Maguire/Garfield, then I suspect that you too will not like this movie.","

"aidanratesmovies","28 November 2021","Although on paper and of course aesthetically this film seems rather pleasing- Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse feels like a missed opportunity of epic proportions- hardly showing any emotion and lacking the depth to triscend it into something extraordinary. I'll start with the pros for this film, I love the animation. Yes it can be a bit jumpy and flashy at times, but it's an incredibly unique and magnificently detailed art style- not to mention its comic like quality in the terms of a comic book based superhero film. The voice work is also pretty well done for the most part, my favorite being Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker and the smaller cameos from John Mulaney and Nicolas Cage as Spider-Ham and Spider-Noir. The film has good intentions and a sweet message, and it's fun to see all the different variations of our favorite characters on screen, but it just seems to lack the emotional depth and charm that so many other films have. It's a trend that has taken a lot of potentially great superhero films down to blissful mediocrity, and never has it been more prevalent to me here. Its formulaic attributes and pacing, and even rhythm at times makes it seem more artificial than genuine and I just feel like it misses the point of what it is trying to say. It has all the right elements, and it even works at times, but it could have been so much more impactful than it was, and that just makes me sad. In the end, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is not at all a bad film, but a mediocre one with somehow high accord. I feel its potential is often greater than its execution and in most people's eyes, they may not be able to tell the difference. I just hope the second one is an improvement.My Rating: 6.4/10.","

"Dorkboss","19 December 2018","Out of every Spider-Man movie I've seen, this movie is the most satisfying Spider-Man film I've ever watched. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse not only tells the story about Miles Morales becoming Spider-Man, but a machine that has the ability to open the multiverse that holds many Spider-People such as Spider-Gwen, Noir Spider-Man, Spider-Pig, etc.While the story is both great and fun, the film also has heart added to the film which is great because you really get attach to the character especially Miles who I really feel for throughout the movie. The animation is really like a comic book is coming to life, not only does the animation helps the action sequence looks so awesome, but each Spider-Character has their own animation style that looks good.With Sony co-owning the Spider-Man rights, along with the MCU, I can see the possibility of this movie having a sequel, they don't need to retell the same story of Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man many times, they can open up the world that is full of Spider-People such as Spider-Man 2099, Scarlet Spider-Man, Cosmic Spider-Man, Spider Carnage, and more.","

"Ziglet_mir","12 January 2020","Heard all the great reviews on this, got excited to see it, and was majorly disappointed. The animation was different and I can certainly appreciate how it reminded me of stop-motion (it is also super colorful), but it gets blurry and weird at times, and I'm not exactly sure what this accomplishes.I am glad to see King Pin as the villain, and I'll be honest I'm not totally up to date with the Miles Morales story arc, but none of that is what made the film disappointing. As already mentioned, the animation is overhyped (colors are pretty and some sequences are well made), but if we are honestly talking about best animation ever... there are at least half a dozen movies made in the last decade that would surpass this IMO (Kubo and the Two Strings probably being the best).Then, the story falls flat and I never felt like there was anything at stake. The universe gets mixed up and Miles is just trying to find his courage in being a hero. Nothing ever feels dire. Most of the comedy falls flat except for some good jokes being made at passed Spider-Man movies and Peter Parker. Far from the best animation ever as most are dubbing it and also far from being awful. I'll probably be one of the few reviews that sits middle of the road.","

Not entirely sure why the main kid has the powers he does because it seems to have nothing to do with a spider but a robotic spider??
Nevertheless it was cool and the story was fun.
HOWEVER its clear the film was animated for 3D but when I watched it in my 2 d theater the normally blurred images in the background (the way we humans see things) were occasionally double images, the likes of which you see in a 3d movie when you watch for a second without the glasses. It was mildly annoying.","

"reesepaul","6 December 2018","I was very lucky as my son and I just got to see the movie before it comes out. I was very impressed. The animation work alone was some of the most impressive work I have ever seen. Thencolorations, and fluidity of movement made a comic book come to life as a motion picture. Props to the soundtrack it was great edgy New York hip Hop in places, heck even works St. Elmo's fire in. I was surprised at the excellent humor throughout.Technically as an older male my knowledge of Spider Man was confined to the classic Peter Parker line. I didn't know of this multiverse. But seeing is believing and it all made sense in the film. I had no idea Spider Ham existed but you will love his parts.I don't and won't spoil the story line but as you can imagine good vs bad many excellent fight scenes. Dr. OC and Kingpin battle the several spider people. If you like animated movies, Marvel comics, go see this movie FYI stay all the way through the credits for a very funny finale.","

"abramzjeremenko","18 December 2018","I personally not see the appeal in movies like this. However, when I sat down and watched this in theaters, I'd have to say that it's the best movie I've in 2018. For those who haven't see this film, I won't spoil any of the plot points. Getting that out of the way I loved many styles the film portrayed. The films way of creating a layered animation, in which, you can see multiple different versions of the same person or object. It mostly gave off the feel of looking through the eyes of a spider.I was also happy to see in this film that they didn't keep dragging on the same story, but just using different actors or scenes. No film, like Spider-Man Homecoming, gave a new outlook on Spider-Man. With a diverse cast whom all seemed to voice act perfectly, my favorite being John Mulaney, they didn't just feel like a bland group of individuals. Instead, the film allowed for the audience to really connect with each character. I don't think that the animation ruins it, I also don't think that it would have changed the quality of the film if it wasn't animated.So, what can a really say? Well, I came into the movie theaters expecting another super-hero movie, but instead, I got to watch a miraculous film that makes me want to become a super-hero fan. It was perfect and amazing.","

"andreaf-78503","20 December 2018","This movie was outstanding! After seeing The Emoji Movie last year, I had low expectations for any Sony movie coming out. After I found out this movie was coming out, I was nervous. Being a Marvel fan at heart, I didn't like the idea of a Marvel movie being put in the hands of Sony. After watching the trailers, I got more hopeful and decided I would check it out. And boy am I glad I did. This movie is one of my favorite animated movies of all time. Let's start with my favorite part of the movie, the animation. I absolutely loved the idea of an animated movie being told as a comic book. It was so colorful. Sure it was a bit blurry at times (once to the point where my friend thought we went to the 3D version on accident) but it made up for it. The part where the glass breaks from the building was beautiful. And Kingpin's body was hilarious. 10/10 for animation. Next, storyline. It was a pretty good story line, but it could've used a bit more work. The beginning was a bit confusing but I would say I was just about as confused as Miles was. One cliché thing though was that if the rest of the Spider people didn't get back to the universe they would disintegrate. Very funny Marvel, very funny. One thing that was really shocking was how(SPOLIER ALERT!!!!!!!) Aaron was secretly Prowler. That shocked the heck out of me. I liked Kingpin's motivation, but I could point it out a mile away. 8/10 for storyline. Last but not least, characters. I personally really enjoyed the characters. I loved that some of the Spider characters got a chance at the big screen. Miles was my favorite by far. I also enjoyed that they had a different version of Peter Parker. The middle-aged, overweight, divorced side of him. I wished they would do a bit more character development for the other characters though. 9/10 for characters. One last thing. I found it really touching that they did a tribute to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko after the credits. They would be very proud of this movie.","

This new take switches up so many things but its essence continues the things that we know and love about our hero. Spideykid as my daughter as now named him is just so damn cool. Just go see it and be amazed at the knowing nods and winks to previous movies. Action,humour and a heartfelt cameo from the king of Marvel make this for me one of the greatest achievements in animation for many years.","

"Dello_","16 October 2022","""Spider-Man into the spider-verse"" is truly an animation masterpiece. It is hands-down the best Spider-Man movie, and one of the best superhero movies ever made. But why is it so? I usually tend not to give maximum ratings to movies, because I think that to be worthy of that 10/10 they need to be great, but also have something very special about them. In this case it is the animation style, that in the end is a comic translated into a movie. This animation is style is not only there to be beautiful, but also it enriches the scenes and the story points thanks to some inspired visual solutions. But is the plot able to take advantage of the animations style? Yes, it does. Indeed, it is entertaining, fun, but also profound and moving in few instances. And finally, also the score is really great and the songs are perfect. The best example of it is the ""what's up danger"" scene, that is able to give me chills every single time I watch it.In the end, ""Spider-Man into the spider-verse ""is a very very good movie. If you are a Spider-Man fan you will probably love it, but even if you're not and you don't usually see superheroes movies, I think that this one is a great watch anyway.","

"troy-daniel-bush","20 September 2023","I like that line! It made me feel something.My first time watching this ever and I really enjoyed it. (Duh, right?) A unique style of animation that you'd think would be a detriment to the action scenes, but it really isn't.The action scenes were a lot of fun.Most of the jokes landed for me. I especially enjoyed the slapstick. The birds... LOL!All of the voice acting is great, for the most part. I especially liked Jake Johnson, Nicolas Cage, Kathryn Hahn, and Hailee Steinfeld.Likeable characters with satisfying arcs.Miles was a fun protagonist to followMy favorite character was Noir Spiderman. And I felt Nicolas Cage was a good choice for that character. His voice made him sound old-fashioned, and his voice helped make the character funny without even trying.I love how Miles learns how to be Spider-Man by reading Spider-Man comics.The twist with Prowler was unexpected.Speaking of twists, when the Doctor revealed her name to be Olivia Octavius I was like, ""Oh crap.""I like most of the character designs.I liked the music.However...The more I think about it, the more I think the usage of a certain licensed song was inappropriate. I'm aware that this is a common criticism and it's common for a reason. It happens at a moment in the film, where it supposed to be emotionally resonant, and it kind of takes away from the intended impact of the scene.I think the movie feels longer than it is. That might change on my second watch.I personally did not like this movie's choice of having Kingpin as the main villain at all. I feel like there are more threatening villains they could've chosen, especially in this movie. I wish the main villain was just Kathryn Hahn's Doc Ock. I found her threatening-enough, as well as deliciously sadistic. And I found Kingpin's design to be incredibly distracting. In all honest, I cannot stand his design. Hahn's Doc Ock looked awesome. I also didn't like Goblin's design. Why is he giant? And where's his glider? Or Scorpion's. I don't like the fact he looks like the Scorpion King at the end of The Mummy Returns.While I didn't mind the Porky Pig Spider-Man, John Mulaney's voice was very distracting. It reminded me of Steve Buscemi in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. (Don't watch that, by the way. Unless you're a masochist. Or if you want to know how to not write a script.)How did Kingpin teleport out of his van before shooting his gun? There was no sound from the car door opening or closing. Then again, maybe it's cartoon logic? I mean, how does he even fit in that tiny car? Lol. Also, during that scene, shouldn't have Miles' Spidey-Sense gone off? Or does that only work if the gun is being pointed at him? The slow-motion following the gunshot was unintentionally funny, too.I did not feel for Kingpin's plight whatsoever, and that's not a result of his character design. I just didn't like him or his role in the film.Also, when you break down the plot, it's pretty standard. However, the animation style, characters, action, and humor make the generic plot totally worth it.Spider-Man 2 is still my favorite Spider-Man. Yeah, I have nostalgia for the Raimi Spiderman movies, and yeah, I am a Raimi shill. But even if those things weren't true, Spider-Man 2 would still be my favorite. The poignant story, the music, action, the villain, Alfred Molina's performance, etc. Plus, there are things in it I personally connect with. Although, Gwen Stacy in this movie is a lot more likeable love-interest than Mary Jane.Looking forward to watching Across the Spiderverse. Apparently, it's darker than the first one, and I love me some darkness.","

"CANpatbuck3664","23 December 2018","I didn't think much of the animation style of this movie when I saw the trailer, it didn't catch my eye and before I learned more about who was involved, my first thought was that it might be a straight to VOD or Blu Ray release. Getting to see it in the theatre, I was blown away. The animation is fantastic, it has its own sense of style, but the colour palette is bright, and the movie is constantly moving throughout its environments. It looks as good as any big studio animation movie for kids if not better. What makes it even more amazing is how the action scenes are put together. They're stunning, the movie is inventive with how they use their characters and you never lose focus of what's happening, but you feel the hits and each character gets bad@$$ moments to show what they can do. In a bloated superhero movie landscape, to get something that kept me this engaged from a visual standpoint is impressive.I prefer my superhero characters to have rough edges and to have some flaws when they dole out justice. Its one of the reasons superheroes like Ironman or anti heroes like Deadpool work so well. I liked Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) as a character because he has a hard time picking up how to be Spiderman, because he has a hard time making the tough choices and because he's so new to this job. He also has some relatable problems (being homesick, trying to live up to expectations, having to choose between what's right and what's easy) that help endear him to the audience. He's a good kid at a difficult time in his life. I also like the fact that they have other superhero characters like Jake Johnson's Peter Parker, Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld) and others to provide some contrast to his style of being Spiderman. But you also have more human characters such as Jefferson (Brian Tyree Henry), Aaron (Mahershala Ali) that present more real-world consequences and represent the different branches he could take depending on what he chooses to do. Especially with his family, things get dark and they really sell the drama of what's going on with Miles and the consequences of his actions.You've got both the action and the drama but the best part of Into the Spider-Verse is the comedy. This movie is gut-busting hilarious, the dialogue is razor sharp and they aren't afraid to get meta or to poke fun at the genre. I saw this with a friend and she described it as Deadpool for kids with the film pointing out dialogue boxes, going into comics for visual representations of origin stories and pulling scenes out of the Sam Raimi Spiderman movies and making jokes about them. So much of the funny content in this movie comes from the alternate universe Spidermen and Spiderwomen and more specifically the Jake Johnson version of Peter Parker. He nails line after line and left me giggling every time. One of the small complaints I had about this movie is that it was so entertaining as a comedy, when it got dramatic (and to be fair those parts are done well too) I waited on the edge of my seat till the jokes started flying again.The voice cast is good across the board and other than my continuous praise for Jake Johnson, everyone does at minimum a descent job. Again, some of my favourites were the alternate universe Spidermen with Nicolas Cage, John Mulaney, Hailee Steinfeld (Gwen is in that category) and Kimiko Glenn all doing unique takes on their characters to round out the cast. Chris Pine is solid in his all too brief appearance as Peter. I really like Mahershala Ali and Brian Tyree Henry as Aaron and Jefferson. Liev Schrieber does what he can as Kingpin, he doesn't get many dialogue heavy scenes, but he gets the job done. I also thought while Shameik was decent as Miles, he gave more of a nondescript performance.This movie was an outright joy to watch. I had heard it was good going in, but it surpassed high expectations. My advice is don't just lump Spider-Verse into the group, it represents what superhero movies need to do to avoid plateauing. You have to change things up and try new things and I think this version of Spider-Man did that for sure. I'm eagerly awaiting a sequel from the same team and although I was late to see this, don't make the same mistake if you love this genre. I wholeheartedly recommend Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and I was close to giving it a 10/10 but I'll still go 9/10 for a couple of small missteps.","

Each character sets their own mark as a personality and animation, and I have not been this stunned by an animated movie (outside of Japan) since Fantastic mr. Fox.

A TRUE comic-book movie. Great for kids & families. It has also got a great, memorable music. As it's a Spidey movie, there's a lot of action as said before and it's executed very well. Every single Spidey is impressive. It's not only for kids but also for adults who won't mind bringing out the kid within themselves. I myself felt like those days, when I watched animated Spider-Man on television with an action figure in my hand, were back.In short, it's a must watch action-adventure movie. Plus, there's an interesting post credits scene, so if you want, you can stay. And of course, love and respect for you Stan Lee, may your soul rest in peace.","

"moviexclusive","7 December 2018","Before you groan that 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is yet another origin story on the titular superhero, let us reassure you that this animated action-comedy from the irreverent minds which brought you 'The LEGO Movie' is like no other origin story you've seen.And truly we mean that in a good, even great way: producers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, together with a trio of directors (Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman), have completely embraced the freedom that the animated genre provides in adapting the array of comic books of the Spider-Man canon. Untethered from the sort of realism that live-action movies are bound to, they have instead created a film with an ultra-stylistic, hyper-kinetic, over-caffeinated aesthetic that is visually dazzling in its own right.Amalgamating Ben-Ray dots, hand-drawn effects and soft-focus backgrounds (reminiscent of the old non-polarised 3D movies with blurry red and blue edges), with a deliberately stilted frame-rate and signature comic-book elements of panelisation and dialogue boxes, it is probably the closest we've come to see of a comic recreated in motion. To be sure, it does get a little over-indulgent at times; in particular, the retina-searing finale that takes place inside a universe-collapsing subterranean device resembles what you may get within an overly aggressive lava lamp, playing like the most sustained stream of vibrant psychedelia we've ever recalled seeing. It's breath-taking all right, even breathless at some points, but there is no denying the imagination and originality that is on display.The same can be said of Lord's script, co-written with Rothman, that boldly imagines a formula-busting origin story with a potent emotional core. At the centre of it is the character of Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), a Brooklyn Afro-Latino teenager having trouble adjusting to life inside a new elite boarding school. Miles, who first appeared in the comic seven years ago from writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli, has had great expectations thrust upon him by his NYPD cop-father Jefferson (Brian Tyree Henry) and nurse-mother Rio (Luna Lauren Velez), but prefers hanging out with his father's estranged brother Uncle Aaron (Mahershala Ali) graffitiing the subways.In Miles' version of New York City, Peter Parker's Spider-Man (Jake Johnson) is a well-established community hero/ vigilante, but Miles realises that Peter's powers aren't quite that exclusive when he himself is bitten by a radioactive spider. Unfortunately, before Peter can teach Miles how to properly navigate his newfound powers, the former is killed while trying to stop the Kingpin (Liev Schreiber) from using his nuclear super-collider from ripping a gash in the space-time continuum and causing several alternate universes to collapse onto the present.Thankfully for Miles, that same machine also opens up portals in other parallel universes, pulling in several alternate Spider-People into his universe. These include a paunchy, washed-up 40-year-old Peter Parker (Johnson again); the graceful, ass-kicking and too-cool-for-school Spider-Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld); the hard-boiled, black-and-white Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage); the cartoonish Peter Porker a.k.a. Spider-Ham (John Mulaney); and last but not least, the anime-inspired Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn) and her arachno-droid SP//dr.Even with upwards of seven Spider-beings and five bad guys (besides the Kingpin, there is also Doc Ock, Prowler, Tombstone and Scorpion in the rogues' gallery), the movie never comes off overstuffed, thanks to a surprisingly poignant relationship between Miles and Peter.Ultimately, this is Miles' coming-of-age story that sees him struggling to step up to the mantle in order to save the world. Next to Miles, the curmudgeonly Peter is both his foil and his mentor, and their relationship is the heart and soul of the movie. In fact, they anchor some of the best sequences in the movie: their first encounter which finds both of them bound and dragged by a subway train through the streets of New York is both exciting and hilarious; and Peter's lesson to Miles how to web-swing through from tree to tree in upstate New York while being chased by Doc Ock is also both exhilarating and joyous to watch.Yet we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge that 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' does sometimes veer into excess. As unapologetically self-referential as it is, its self-awareness sometimes proves too clever for its own good, tipping so far into fan service that it comes off rather self-indulgent. It is also guilty of resorting to the same superhero comic-book clichés that it pokes a postmodern finger at, most notably how the key to disarming the Kingpin's supercollider is a simple USB device. And there is so much going on that certain emotional notes do not ring as loudly as they should, and that is especially true of the family triangle comprising Miles, his cop dad and his cool uncle that feels less fleshed out than it should be.Even so, this is one of the most original superhero origin stories we've seen in a very long while, and that alone says a lot for a character like Spider-Man which has seen no less than three reboots over the past few years. With this high-concept animated movie, Sony has finally moved on from Peter Parker in a manner that acknowledges his significance and expand the Spider-Verse in fresh and exciting ways. Credit to that belongs very much to Lord and Miller, whose sensibilities are all over the movie, ranging from its witty quips to its breakneck pace to its meta-textual treatment.Fans of the Spider-Man comics will quite surely love it to bits, but there is also plenty for the casual viewer to enjoy in this fast, funny and thrilling piece of definitive pop-culture. It is brilliant all right, and we dare say one of the best Spider-Man movies ever made.","

"nimdude","13 December 2018","This one is a complete home run. I'm pretty sure that the praise for this movie will be positively one-sided and for very good reason.Quickly touching on the negative . Like there's only two things I didn't like about this movie. The first is the narrative cliche's found in every super hero movie ever so its not a big fault but it happens and it annoys me but only ever so slightly. The second is when a character learns a particular skill set just by deciding he wants to be good at it, its an unconvincing way to further the story and a pretty lazy one.But all that is only about 5% of the whole movie. The rest is an absolute overload of the senses in a very very good way.I don't want to mention the characters in this movie because some of them might surprise you so all of them worked and all of them were fantastic.The movie is crazy funny, and its funny in a way that is actually refreshing in modern blockbusters. Its funny without being political. CONGRATULATIONS you didn't make any politically charged jokes that are one sided in a big budget Sony movie. I hope this new trend continues where jokes aren't politicized in movies.The voice acting is spot on from everyone, don't want to mention names as some might be a surprise.I find the story to be almost on par with everyones favorite Spider-Man stories (Rami) in terms of quality, mainly because all the central themes and character morality are there in the story. Power, responsibility and all that jazz. It isn't empty like in the Amazing Spider-Man .The thing that surprised me most about this movie (aside from how genuinely funny it is) is how much emotion there is at it's core. Family, friends and sacrifice are a huge undertone of the movies core message.The main thing I took away from the film is the visuals. Holy every god ever this movie is gorgeous as hell. The most gorgeous in recent memory, and certainly my personal favorite visuals in an animated movie ever.9.3/10","

"alexthegreat350","14 December 2018","My expectations were pretty high, I knew this film was gonna be good, but not THIS good. I mean I could give this film a 10 on animation alone. Its bright colors, fluid movements almost like a music video, and those comic book text boxes across the screen were a brilliant artistic choice. I realize that with movies like this the more obvious aspects like amazing action and visuals can make me not even think about the amazing character relationships and dialogue. The triangle between Miles, Jefferson an his uncle(sorry I forget lol) felt very realistic and grounded. Miles had a specific soft spot for his uncle, which was explored early on in the film. I really enjoyed how Jefferson wasn't a hardass annoying dad, and he wasn't a softie. He was just a guy, that wasn't 100% sure how to reach out to miles, but that didn't matter because he was doing his best. Also the talent from the amazing voice acting cast was undeniable. As a huge big mouth fan I kept finding myself laughing at John Mulaney as Peter porker. Not to mention they got Nicholas cage, who felt very natural for Spider noir. Who doesn't love that guy. I was pretty happy to see the concept of the multiverse explored in this movie, and I loved the brief, but still unique and interesting takes on each of the characters universe. I would love to see a solo movie for one of these characters, but I feel like thats a bit of stretch. I also want to talk about the most grabbing and probably the best aspect fo this film, the incredible visuals. I have always been a fan of animated films and TV, because with animation, there is not creative limit. Those limits, or lack there of is clearly on display for a majority of this film. Some of the shots and scenes (Especially the final act) just look like they would be incredibly difficult and/or expensive to film in live action. Not impossible though of course because we all saw ""Avengers: Infinity War."" Any-who I was constantly looking up at the screen in awe as I watched these beautifully animated and well developed swinging around the screen. I really enjoyed watching miles grow from not knowing what he was doing at all do understanding and really feeling his powers, with the help of Peter Parker. Speaking of Peter and Miles, I love the kind of relationship they shared, almost comparable to a really cool teacher and a student who desperately anted to learn everything. Overall this film had Excellent characters and character building, stunning visuals, beautiful animation, amazing cast, and an amazing script with dialogue that felt like a real conversation, and at times, very very funny. Point is go watch this movie ASAP it truly is a spectacular, colorful, work of art.","

"erenerginler","21 December 2018","I'm not a person who likes to rewatch movies right after finishing them. But for this, I can say that everything has a first.Let's get the obvious out of the way, the animation. I love how this movie looks. The creators really put effort in making this. There are scenes where text appears on screen. It literally looks like a comic book. And while I haven't read many comic books, I still think it looks amazing. I also appreciate how Peni Parker is drawn like an anime girl, and Spider-Ham (aka my favorite one) is drawn like a character from loony toones. But everyone has talked about the animation, so you probably know anyway.The story is as amazing as the animation. Well not quite, but close. If you didn't know, this movie is about this villian king pin (if I'm getting that right) who opens portals to 5 different dimensions. Each one brings a new spider person. But the main character isn't even peter, it's miles. Miles gets bitten right before the dimension opening, and so he is a noob for most the movie. Ok I'll stop the spoilers. The emotion in this movie, while predictable, is pretty powerful. The humor, which is important to me, is pretty good. And while that mainly comes from the spectacular peter porker, there are some other good jokes too.My probably biggest complaint is that the sidekicks (noir ham and peni) weren't used enough. Like I know this is about miles, and peter and Gwen play a big role in that, the sidekicks were advertised a lot too, and they barely got any screen time. Although in the final battle, peni and ham get pretty good scenes.
Overall, I can't wait to rewatch this when it's on dvd, and please just go see it.","

"CinemaSerf","24 October 2022","I'm still a little wary of this multi-verse theme. I find it can lead to some seriously lazy writing as inter-dimensional characterisations can write, then re-write their own pasts and futures in a fashion that can become dull and repetitive quickly. This is not one of those. It centres around ""Miles"", a young lad who likes to hang out with his wayward uncle ""Aaron"" and who has a penchant for street art. It's whilst they are decorating an underground wall that he gets bitten by a spider and soon afterwards starts to feel the effects of his spidery-transformation. Meantime, the real ""Spider-Man"" aka ""Peter Parker"" falls foul of the evil ""Kingpin"" who has created a collider that will enable him to enter parallel realities in the hope of reuniting with his family, tragically lost to him years earlier. The more he messes with the timeline, though, the more chaotic the effects and the more our new, trainee, ""Spider-Man"" meets his equivalents from those different dimensions. It isn't long before they conclude that only as a team can they hope to thwart the megalomaniac and young ""Miles"" must find new inner strength to take charge of this mission to ensure all his colleagues get safely home. It's a good, characterful, story this - the youngster finding his feet and learning to use his new-found skills is entertaining to watch. The dialogue is frequently quite amusing, and the action scenes hold the attention rather than recycle themselves endlessly. As I watched it, I wondered if it might have made for a good exercise for 3D cinema. As it is, though, it's quickly paced with plenty of action, a little food-for-thought and it might just be the most ""human"" of the Spidey iterations I've yet seen.","

Its colorful, sketchy, comic book style but like dope.The best part is story tho. The problem with spiderman is that, its always somehow an origin story and we have dozens of those by now. Aaaand this one is also an origin story, however its not. It is but its told in such a way that you don't feel bored. You wanna know more, you get excited for it.Honestly I can keep rambling about it..i loved it, everyone i know loved it. Its freaking lovely.Watch it. And watch it in a cinema.

"K-Noah","27 December 2018","Was that very hard to make a very decent Spider-man movie, Sony?Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse is directed by Peter Ramsey, Robert Persichetti Jr. and Rodney Rothman, screenplay by Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman, and voices-starring by Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld and Mahershala Ali.Story by Phil Lord, and it's about Brooklyn teen Miles Morales, and the limitless possibilities of the Spider-Verse, where more than one can wear the mask.First time I heard about this movie I wasn't that hype about the idea of the movie or the animation. The trailer wasn't so clear about its animation, or the very bold storyline! When I went to see this movie I was blown away by the striking animation and the bold storytelling.. I think it's a very risky step for Sony to take, to make a very unique, new and comic-alike animation, I mean what if the audience didn't like it? It could have been a big disappointing movie, because it has an amazing story, I think this story is definitely the best story of the whole Spiderman movies, also the animation is amazing, it's flawless!
When an animation movie brings the live-action movies down, it means that it's definitely unique and bold!!The story didn't take so long to get you into the main plot, it went with its surprising ""scene"" -I'm not gonna spoil anything in this review- and though it made a very good introduction of the characters, so the first act was very good, shocking and humorous too!The second act still a very funny and thrilling as the first act, introducing the rest of the characters, so it took more time to get us back to the main plot, and I loved it, because some characters wasn't that clear in the first act that I wanted to know more about, and others that I wanted more of their backstories because I liked them! After introducing the ""rest of the characters"" we get another shocking scene, driving us to another shocking scene.. excuse me if I'm mysterious about some stuff, but I don't want to spoil anything, and still, if you watched the movie, you're gonna understand me very well.The third act was very predictable though, but still very thrilling because of its amazing animation combined with the amazing action, and emotions... Oh yeah, the third act is completely emotional, and action-full!There're not any subplots like Fantastic Beasts the Crimes of Grindelwald or something, it's very straight and clear.. very good for kids, and amazing for Spider-man fans and adults as well.I think that Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse is the Spider-Man that we deserve as fans of Spider-Man and it's definitely the best Spider-Man movie of all the time.! And of course, Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse gets an A+!Alright, guys.. thank you as always for reading and supporting my work, and if you liked this you can click on my name above and read all of my reviews, lots of movie-reviews are coming ahead.. thanks again!","

"realmuthaf","16 December 2018","I didn't quite expect this level of good when going to the cinema - Into The Spider-Verse ended up delivering on pretty much everything.The jokes are actually funny - no underage cringy garbage shoehorned by Disney into their movies. Special thanks to Nicholas ""Noir"" Cage. The visual style is astonishing, pays close homage to the comics, but still looks distinct and aesthetically pleasing. The drama here surprisingly works, and some moments in this movie are very far from being childish. Of course the Spider-Verse also has a ton of references to everything from the Raimi trilogy to the recent PS4 game, and they're also great, make sure to stay for the after-credits scene. Even the protagonist Morales also works, as opposed to the aforementioned PS4 game, where he was kind of dull.So yeah, miles (no pun intended) ahead of the MCU and of Sony's own previous live-action attempts, Into The Spider-Verse is a great animated movie, totally looking forward to the announced spin-off and sequel.","

"benj-20839","12 December 2018","99% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which is the Highest rated DC and Marvel movie EVER! And an 8.6 IMDB rating...so i had high hopes going in, plus i love the previous Spider-Man movies but boy was this one average, below average actually hence my 4/10. I feel duped by the critics AGAIN. The critics scores for this movie are WAY too suspicious for this.Let's get the animation out of the way first since they seem to be raving about it so much. Through watching many many animations we all know that nice visuals don't make for an entertaining film, especially if the other components of storytelling don't add up. The animation was as good as any good ones out there already, so i would say that it's not a good reason to go and spend loads on money at the cinema for that reason alone. This definitely can be watched at home. At random times throughout the film they do this kind of 3D visuals animation which give your eyes and head a funny turn tbh. If you've watched a 3D movie without glasses then you'll know what i mean.The film was so haphazard editing and story wise that it really took you out of the flow of the story, so it made it difficult to stay connected to the characters and story. This made it feel like it was aimed at young children to stop them from losing interest. It almost just felt like constant random scenes which didn't flow smoothly story wise.The other thing that made the film tiresome when trying to connect to the characters/story was the use of jokes/one-liners, they were relentless and was full of them. I love comedy in superhero films, the MCU do a great job of that and the previous Spider-Man movies too but this was like a kids animation style of non-stop but with adult humour, that i'm afraid i didn't laugh at once...and i usually laugh at nearly everything. Besides myself, there was only an adult and 2 children in the screen and i didn't hear them laugh either tbh.The story was pretty standard, exactly what the trailer tells you but i did get restless and bored when there was no action.Its my least favourite Spider-Man movie and as animations go its not good either, especially when you've got Pixar, Illuniation, Manga, etc delivering such epic and fun movies already.Nicolas Cage was my favourite Spider-Man in this, even though he wasn't one of the central characters and didn't get much screen time. It would be great if they made a film just centered around his character sometime.There were 2 or 3 short emotional scenes in this that i liked, i'm a sucker for that stuff lol.There is a post-credits scene so stay til the very end.4/10.","

"jhalcollege","22 December 2018","This movie is definitely not as good as everyone is making it out to be.The movie starts off simply enough. Miles is your average Hollywood teen, who is the son of the only police officer in New York City. And if you want to see yet another person get bitten by a radioactive spider, then you're in luck.75% of the film is Miles trying and failing to be Spiderman. He's incapable of controlling any of his powers, and does little more than get in the way and utter cliche lines such as ""I have to do this. I promised."" It's rather frustrating to watch. But conveniently, he figures everything out in the last half hour and becomes a better hero than all the other Spidermen who've been in the business for years.Speaking of everyone else, as the story progresses, the audience is introduced to more and more Spiderman variations (and more unusual villains). With so much content, they barely get any more than just a few minutes of screen time. Spiderman Noir was interesting, for the five lines he had. I'm pretty sure there was some kind of Penny Porker character, but I may be mistaken. There's also a Scorpion villain who shows up out of nowhere, then mostly disappears.As a whole, the movie was filmed assuming that the audience's attention span is a about 1 second. Most jokes are cringe worthy, especially after you've seen them in the trailer. There's also way too much flash going on, and the movie's final scene is about as visually complex as a Jackson Pollock spatter painting.Spiderverse doesn't do anything that hasn't been done time and again.","

So it is the adults who are going ga ga over a kids movie. So much for the purpose. But who cares when the box office cash is flowing.
I found the plot to be mushed and too complicated. The animation seemed blurred in many places. I dont know if that was the intention. And the 3D effects are nothing to rave about. Very Ordinary.There are far better 3D animation movies out there and I wont rate this in the list of Top-10 3D animated movies..","

"u-66754","24 December 2018","This must be the most impressive animation for me this year and the whole movie is beyond my imagination!Sony and Columbia really have done a great job, the music, the scenes and the spot are really excellent. As a crazy comics fan (both Japanese comics and American comics), the expression of this movie undoubtedly wins my heart. At first I was a little worried about the fusion of 3-D and 2-D and lower frames, the finished movie completely removes my worry, even I prefer this form than common animation! At the beginning of the movie, I was not into the mood of it and felt kind of strange. Then getting used to it, I felt like I was in a huge comic book. Every scene's just so fascinating, like a page of a comic book. Of course if you are more used to reality TV shows and movies, you may not like this expression XD.The fusion of comics in this movie, to a certain extent, is a supplement for limitation of 3-D animation. It is hard to directly (visually) show the inner side of a scene in a pure 3-D animation. The word it posts, the switching color it shows, extremely enhance the sense in that scene, such as the shot part. I think Disney's 3-D animation is more and more pursuing the sense of reality, and it is sophisticated to copy the sense of exaggeration, which is easily conveyed in a 2-D animation movie. Hope that more companies can consider more innovative expression of animation, instead of making orthodox animations all the time.Back to the movie itself, under excellent background music, the narrative, the pace, the characters and emotional expressions are great, better than some superhero movies. The main topic is absolutely ""Expectations"", and the whole movie clings close to it. Miles yearns for Spider-Man and shoulders expectations from his mates. Conflicts between father and son, Peter and MJ are solved in the end. The description of growing, friendship, family and love is very touching, thanks to excellent music and pace-controlling.Somehow I perceive kind of shadow of Japanese animation, don't know it is my illusion or because of Peni Parker XD. I think Sony is suitable for this kind of movies.As defects, maybe this kind of expression is not suitable for some audiences. Such as dizziness in the background, I'm fascinated by this unique style personally, but I find some people think it makes them dizzy. And the plot in the middle part is kind of disfluent and averaged.And, hardly count it as a defect, the final fight is so so so gorgeous and extraordinary! I was completely captured by the switching color in the background and could not focus on the fight! (My bad!!)In general, I really adore this movie and hope you all guys can watch it!","

"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","26 December 2018","When I saw the teaser at the end of 2017 after Spider-Man Homecoming came out, I became really interested as did my brother and later this year we saw it on its second weekend. To our surprise, we loved it so much I consider it the number one movie of the year. Even more so than Avengers Infinity War.Not only does it pay homage to the Spider-Man legacy, but it also respects everything that made it so iconic since the 1960s. The writing from Phil Lord who directed the 21 Jump Street movies, The Lego Movie, and Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs with Christopher Miller is very good making for some nice humor and really solid emotion and drama and the idea of other spider people coming from other dimensions is done really well. Also the character arc for Miles Morales, a likeable character by the way, is really compelling as he struggles to find who he is.The music score is atmospheric and beautiful and the song choices don't feel out of place which is very rare. The pacing is really good and there's not even a dull moment. The directing from three directors including Peter Ramsey (who directed DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians) is superb and the voice acting is entertaining with Shameik Moore Jake Johnson Hailee Steinfeld Mahershala Ali Brian Tyree Henry Lily Tomlin Luna Lauren Velez John Mulaney Nicolas Cage Chris Pine and Leiv Schreiber giving fantastic performances.And last but not least the action sequences and the animation which is by far the best elements of the movie. The Spider-Men costumes and the Spider-Women costumes are well detailed and the choreography for the action revolving around them are some of the best I've seen in animation history since the Kung Fu Panda franchise. Especially the leap of faith sequence which I'm sure you've all seen from the teaser trailer which was the highlight of the film to me.Anyway, Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse is for my perspective the best Spider-Man movie and one of the best animated movies of 2018. A sequel and spinoff is in the works and with that, this receives a LordoftheFuture seal of approval. Go see it!","

"TheMovieDiorama","16 December 2018","It took Sony over a decade to finally create a decent superhero flick that involves not one web slinger, but six of them. Well, better late than never I suppose. However, it's not just a decent adaptation. Oh no no no! Much to my surprise (and everyone else's), it is one of the strongest superhero blockbusters to ever be released. In a time where saturation and fatigue is settling in, it is incredibly refreshing to see one beautiful animation reinvigorate an entire genre. Student Miles Morales is having a hard time dictating his own life, but after being bitten by a radioactive spider he soon comes to terms with his new powers. Stop right there! We've seen this far too many times now. Fortunately, something unique is injected into the repetitive origin story that we all know and love. Parallel dimensions are merged, forcing six alternate ""Spider-Creatures"" to team up and stop Kingpin from destroying worlds. So why after all these years does this work? Well, we actually have to thank the failures that came before it. The origin story has been told countless times, the writers know this and intelligently use that to their advantage. Satirising 'Spider-Man 3' and the infamous ""emo"" dance sequence. It almost lovingly pays homage to previous iterations, but translates the mediocrity into humour that consistently hits with every line of dialogue. Honestly, haven't laughed this much during a film in many years. The humour is never forced, with each punchline ingeniously executed heightening the personality of the various incarnations of Spider-Man. Mix that with the astute action that feels both chaotic and beautiful, creating frequent doses of entertainment.Then the ambitious amount of character development that is spread between Miles, Peter and Gwen (the other three are utilised mainly for comedy) allows warmth and humanity to be at the core of the story. You see the natural progression of Miles as he experiences tragedy, you witness Peter wanting to repair broken bonds with MJ. The familiar yet unfamiliar environment and the newly obtained powers allows them to interact with each other, becoming better superheroes and people. It doesn't stop there though. The family life of Miles is then tested as he rapidly becomes distant from them, establishing a delicate relationship with his father and uncle. Kingpin's motives into creating a dimensional collider, although thinly developed, adds a layer of sympathy towards him. And so much more! What I'm trying to get at, is that the screenplay balances everything. It's a perfectly toned story that nails absolutely every aspect. A rare achievement for the majority of family-friendly blockbusters, whilst still catering to hardcore Marvel fans. The pop art animation is sensational. Various shots of Miles swinging between skyscrapers were breathtaking. The excessive use of vivid colours enables the comic book style to seep through the screen, almost crafting a visual comic strip. Subtitled onomatopoeia and dialogue further aids the comic aesthetic. The voice acting was decent. Whilst there were no standouts, all the actors were consistently good and gave life to the animation. Was a nice surprise hearing Cage as noir Spider-Man. My only critique, and it comes down to personal taste, is the overuse of pop music. A trend all too popular in modern animations, it may feel current now but in years to come will become exhaustingly outdated. An all original score would've been more beneficial. Suffice to say, Sony finally delivered the film that Spider-Man fans deserve. A gorgeous web of entertainment that will appeal to everyone.","

"andrewburgereviews","30 April 2019","The triple, yes, triple directed (Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman) ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" runs like a comic-book from the year 3019, a mostly stop-motion animation style executed to a revolutionary level, but also mixing noir, anime and freaking Looney Tunes-inspired cartoons. It's one of the best films ever when it comes strictly to animation, every frame filled with clever pop culture references of which I probably missed most.Albeit, this is a very stylized film, even for an animation. Young, chic and cool as hell, this is a blast to watch from start to finish and, thankfully, the style does not get too much in the way of substance. But this film does not go too deep in the feel department, although for something that looks this cool and restless I was mostly satisfied with the treatment for its characters. They all lost someone or something, including the villain here, which is Wilson Fisk a.k.a. Kingpin (Liev Schreiber) even though the film does not treat him with the same sympathy as the heroes. You must argue that this is normal, and it would be, but by the end I felt for the big guy.But indulge me as I get back to the animation. Its quality resides not only in its ans-amble look, but also in the design of its characters. I am still amazed by Kingpin's gargantuan look, spawning a black suit and tie with a white shirt and his imposing bald head stuck in the middle looking asymptotically close to a parody, yet it wasn't. This extreme design creates an intensity and pace that never really stops, not even in the film's quieter moments.Between the ""you can do this"" and ""believe in yourself"" teenage angst there are many fourth wall moments, most notably the way it parodies previous Spider-Man materiel, especially a certain dance in the street. There is a lot of fan service here as this film's ultimate point is to symbolize Spider-Man as an ideal rather than a person. But Spider-Man is not worthy of something like this. He is too stylish and not morally complicated enough, but the effort was visible and admirable.""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is a hip, creative teenager with big dreams and it does not have enough patience to involve itself emotionally too much. But it pays you back with every single frame. If you are a fan of animation, this is a must-see.","

"krishkhatiwada","19 December 2018","Summary: MUST WATCH in cinemas. Do not watch this movie on your little phone or laptop.You have probably already noticed everyone talking about how amazing the amimation is, and all of it is 100 percent true. I find it hard to describe the animation and be able to justify how amazing it is, so go witness it for yourself on a big screen. The movie is funny and ""over-the-top"" in the best way possible. Soundtrack is really good.Pros:
All the characters are surprising well developed considering their unequal screen time, but off course this is Miles Morales' story first and foremost and he gets to shine. His arc is great and the ending to this arc is executed really well.
All supporting characters are well thought out and have their own moments to shine.Con:
I felt that a few emotional beats failed to really hit me, and be totally invested in Miles' story.All in all, Spider-Man: Into the spiderverse is an awesome movie to watch and I hope we get to see this type of animation further developed and used.","

"shakes77","2 January 2019","Where do I begin with this film? I'll keep it brief:
Hopefully zero spoilers!
Let's start with the visuals - Sony have taken the game forward with this animation! It's breathtaking, beautiful and really is like you're watching a living comic book. It's visually stunning and defines the quality of this film from outset. Even the dots on the screen to represent the comic book style - amazing!The story is so good and does justice to bring the Miles Morales story to the fore. Mixing the characters from the multiverse is done so well - all lovable given the right amount of screen time respectively.It's genuinely funny - if no one laughs when you watch it then it's probably the zombie apocalypse - the jokes are heartfelt and honest. That's not to say that this film doesn't have the feels - it does - but used in the right way.Finally - the music. We all know Post Malone is a genius and this soundtrack is epic - better than Kendrick Lamar's Black Panther - and used so well throughout the film.This ia a wonderful film that will make you fall in love with or reaffirm your love for Spiderman while at the same time introducing Miles Morales as the future of the Spider-verse.Stay for both post-credit scenes - worth it. Also look out for Stan Lee's cameo in the film - emotional.","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","26 September 2021","Miles Morales(Moore, easy to relate to, more interesting than many others, with his bilingual, biracial background) is a huge fan of Spider-Man, so he's of course ecstatic when he gets a chance to meet him. And then he meets another one, who's kind of jaded. And that's not the last good person he meets who has that set of abilities...So this is easily the best solo movie featuring the titular character(s). It's just so incredibly well done in almost every single way. The animation doesn't only take countless traits directly from the medium of comic books, it basically puts one on the silver screen, the first time that's truly been done. Music, both the original score and the licenced songs, work astonishingly well, are deeply memorable. It's tremendously funny employing countless different types of comedy... situational, references, wit, sarcasm, sight gags, not to mention its amazing use of subversion of expectation, which also works for the drama. This is tremendously moving. The action is exciting, cool and impactful. It was honestly about time for some diversity for this New York hero - can you believe that in 16 years, 6 live-action entries, 3 continuities, we still didn't have even one non-white lead? And instead of resting on its laurels, it also includes multiple superpowered women, one of whom is Asian.This is arguably too intense for anyone below the age of 9, and be ready to have a reassuring conversation with any child you show this to as soon as the credits roll(be sure to stay through them for the stinger!). Other than that, there is nothing featured that means it can only be watched by teens or adults. And yet it manages to be very mature. I recommend this to anyone who thinks that there is some chance that they might find the concept appealing. 10/10.","

"martinmcdonough","28 January 2019","I'm not sure what the point of this movie was. Usually, a ""first"" super hero movie gives us the hero's backstory, the origin of their powers, how they grapple with these new found powers, some sort of personal tragedy (that ultimately leads them to becoming a hero instead of a villain), and a focus point for the resolution of their conflicting issues in the form of whatever shape or form the villain takes. After that, it's sequel after endless sequel.I get it.What I don't get is the purpose of THIS movie. There already IS a Spider-Man. He's Peter Parker, photographer for the Daily Bugle, and so on and so forth. We all know about his Aunt, Uncle, the radioactive spider, J. Jonah, M.J. and the cadre of bad dudes he eventually takes on (and down). So, with that in mind, I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be (1) yet another re-imagining of the story for a newer, hip audience, (2) an introduction of several new characters, or (3) an intense marketing ploy to get young viewers interested in the printed version of these heroes? Why else would each character have it's own ""Issue #1"" cover shown during the movie as well as their own brief backstory / origin explanation?It has to be one of those explanations because in every stand-alone movie or comic book, the super hero fights the bad guy typically by himself / herself without the aid of other super heroes (Avengers and other super groups notwithstanding). Spider-Man, Superman, Batman, et al always fought the Green Goblin, Lex Luthor and the Joker (among others) by themselves. But in this movie, five (or was it six) Spider-Men/Women were needed to take Kingpin down? Not likely.Also, this movie had alot going on and went nowhere. The start of the movie was tedious, plodding and slow. And, most importantly, the formula was incredibly predictable. If there were any jokes, they fell flat and were unremarkable, sans the obligatory Stan Lee cameo as the comic shop owner.Once the action started, it was kind of pointless and repetitive. And I kept coming back to the central question I had while watching the movie, as they kept introducing version after version of Spider-Men: do these comic characters already exist somewhere else and this movie is just a ploy to expose them to a wider audience?So, the questions are: Are we being exposed to the NEW Spider-Man? Are we being exposed new, multiple Spider-Men? Why were there no new villains (and making Dr. Octopus a woman is NOT making a new villain, by the way). All of that (and more) brings me back to the central idea of this review - I'm not sure what the point of this movie was.","

"view_and_review","30 December 2018","You know, I had my doubts about this movie. Spider-Man as a full animation. I just kept thinking, ""gonna be quirky."" Well, it was quirky at times, but it worked.The fact that they toyed with the idea of multiple universes actually made the quirkiness work. The featured universe has a new Spider-Man by the name of Miles Morales. When other universes collide with his we get multiple versions of Spider-umm... beings. I can't call them Spider-Men or Women because one of them was actually a pig. I know it sounds strange and blasphemous even, but it worked.The story worked really well and the animation-ness of it allowed for some freedom with the action. I wasn't mad at it because it didn't go too far off the rails. It held onto enough real Spidey drama to suspend the hardcore Spider-Man fans while diverging enough to attract those looking for something new. I liked it a whole lot more than I expected to.","

Trippy at times, the vivid colors of New York at night while spidey slings through it are mesmerizing.The movie doesn't follow the same old Spiderman formula and brings the multiverse into the picture.Characters are relatable, especially a 30 year old divorced Peter Parker. Other Spiderpeople in the movie are also interesting and the movie is full of pop culture references.This movie has great potential to start an epic Marvel animated universe. *sigh* If only there was no dispute over character rights between studios.","

Stan Lee and the rest of the crew really out did themselves.This movie did a good job introducing miles morals as a character and portraying his origin while introducing the spider-verse in the most spectacular way. It is pretty a new Spider-Man for the new generation.The plot and how it was timed was excellent and it wasn't predictable what so ever. Alongside that it delivers the message across without over doing.The animation and art style was pretty good though I didn't really like how the kingpin looked but it did still work especially when they had to animation bend in the movie.The voice acting was pretty good despite a few missing lip movement of the characters while talking.I admit when first saw the trailer the animation looked a lot like a stop motion advert but I was wrong.It is a pretty cool movie overall and I would really recommend it if you are a Spider-Man fan.","

"dromasca","3 February 2019","I do not have the habit of apologizing for my guilty pleasures, and I will not do it this time either. From time to time I love to watch animation movies. I do it not only for the nostalgia of Walt Disney's masterpiece or to remember the pleasure of sharing the experience with my kids some time ago (it's the turn of my grand-kids now), but also because I believe that the animation films, like any other genre, have their own successes as well as failures. When it succeeds, good animation is an aesthetic pleasure, a source of emotions and thrills, a joy that we remember in time as we remember any other good films. But this is not the case with 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' - the latest success from the House of Marvel. And I will not argue with the success either.The more ambitious films of the comic-inspired genre are trying to bring new ideas to attract viewers, as even the most passionate fans of the genre need something new from time to time. In 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse', not even this new idea is exactly original - I've already seen in quite a few other movies the heroes of different comic series as they were brought to the screen and combined as heroes into the same story. In this case, the heroes of the various variants drawn or derived from Spider-Man, including Spider-Man Noir and Spider Girl, are gathered in one place (Manhattan, where else). Parallel universes of different stories with spider-men meet for the pleasure of the connoisseurs. Those less familiar with the sub-genre characters will not get that much from this reunion, and the resulting action did not seem terribly interesting to me either.The result is, in my opinion, that we are dealing with yet another routine movie (animation movie this time), similar to just another magazine in a comics collection. For the enthusiasts it is important not to miss any issue. As an occasional spectator, nothing in the 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' seemed to me to be special, neither the animation nor the 3-D effects, neither the action nor the humor or the characters (the good or the bad). I'm sure this film will take its place in the collection and I am also sure that I'll forget it quickly. Its makers have been able to create something sparkling but already dusty before time.","

"Brevin_Campbell","24 December 2018","A Review from a comic book nerd XDWhen going into Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse I was very excited. I had been reading Miles Morales since 2014 alongside Kamala Khan, and while I never loved him as much as I loved Kamala I had always enjoyed the story of Miles in the Ultimate Universe. He felt different from Peter Parker as he was more grounded in his responsibility to his family first. He was never defined by some major death of a family member the way Peter was, but rather instead by the loss of his Peter Parker. He became Spider-Man to honor his Peter's legacy, and that felt like a solid motivation to me.Back in the Ultimate Universe era Bendis was on a hot streak with Jessica Jones, Daredevil, and other street level heroes. This fine tuned writing really did well for the Ultimate Spider-Man as he would eventually create a really powerful bond between 616 Peter Parker and the 1610 one, and it was this relationship that I was elated to see get portrayed on the big screen.However there was one major worry I had about this film, and that was the entire concept of the spider verse. I just never liked the idea of a billion spider characters all coming together in one big giant event, and I defiantly didn't want it in Miles's first movie when he should be the focus. It also made me feel like these writers didn't think Miles could stand on his own which also irked me. Luckily though in the film these other characters don't take away from the character of Miles Morales as the film still revolves around him. The other Spider characters are kind of just there to help felt the big bad, and because the film is still called ""Into the Spider-Verse,"" but there not major. I did like Spider-Man Noir a lot, and also Penni Parker was cool too.In regards to the animation for the film I felt it always looked pretty crisp and clean. I liked the style of allowing a comic book come to life in animation. It allows for it to feel more realistic, and for the colors to start to pop more. You can tell that the writers put a lot of love and care when crafting this film with the stylization in mind. It is something that is both amazing and spectacular. Pun intended. :-PThere is quite a lot in the film that pulls from Miles's story in the Ultimate Universe. I really enjoyed seeing Ultimate Green Goblin realized on the big screen, and his battle against Peter Parker was absolutely great. I also loved the death of Ultimate Peter Parker as it both dark and brutal. I literally started to have goosebumps in the theater when watching it. There was also the bond between Aaron Davis and Miles that was captured perfectly, and when Aaron died it felt like my soul left my body.That being said despite my love for this scene I did find Aaron's death to be a bit problematic. It makes Miles lose some of his individuality in my opinion. And with the movie trying so hard to get us to see that Miles is more than a Peter Parker knock off the idea that Miles would need another major loss to define him really undercuts his development. Especially when we have a more compelling story to tell with his relationship with his Uncle were Miles is caught between the world of crime and the world of a hero.Going into some performances I thought everyone did a pretty solid job. I thought Chris Pine's portrayal of Peter Parker was very original and a different take on the character. I found Jake Johnson's Peter to be absolutely amazing and quite memorable too. Hailee Steinfeild as Gwen Stacy was perfect casting in my opinion, and her friendship that she created with Miles was really heartfelt. And I can't wait for that to be developed more if we ever get a sequel to this movie.Overall this was a exceptional film with a really heartfelt story. It understands what makes Miles a really compelling character, and was just a lot of fun to watch on screen, and so for that reason and others I truly believe that this movie deserves many accolades.","

"Zac_La_Porte","7 August 2023","It's without a doubt that what really shines about this Spider-Man movie is its gorgeous blend of 2D animation techniques and 3D computer graphics. Say if it were still an animated or even just a live-action film, but excluding the stylish visual aspect that the creators were able to piece together, Into the Spider-Verse would be exciting, humorous, heartfelt, but it would lack being truly memorable. It feels like the style the filmmakers chose gains them a point that brings them to jump over a barrier that that separates the unforgettable and the fantastic-but-still-disposable.Miles Morales is an awkward young teenager who also happens to be the protagonist of the film, as he suddenly gains spider-like superpowers after being bitten by a spider. But when a threat against the Multiverse shows up, he must team up with other individuals from different dimensions and become the Spider-Man of his universe. In terms of the animation techniques, which are better described as distinguishable animation techniques combined together, you can probably find a dozen dissections of the style used here.This is an absolutely beautiful movie to look at; singular action sequences alone with take your breath away. But the story, which is paced perfectly with a smooth runtime between 110 minutes and 120 minutes, is also to desire when it comes to making a superhero movie. The characters are excellent; all voiced by talent, and there's a lot of jokes that hit the spot as well. For most audiences, the thing about the story that will attach to most of them other than the fact that it's very entertaining, is the emotional family aspect and themes of grief it wants to take on. By the end, some of these grief concepts aren't touched on satisfyingly enough, but a sequel might address some of these leftover details.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

This film gives nonstop punches with awesome fight scenes, and plenty of fresh humor between the fights.Each of the voice actors felt perfect for their counterpart, even Nick Cage as Spider man Noire.But of course, what I loved the most was the amazing animation. Unique, accurate, and every different spider man has its own art style! Penny has a more manga art style, Spider Ham has a very cartoony style, and Noire has the 40 and 50's crime show vibe. And it nailed ALL OF THEM!The plot took some turns I really wasn't expecting, and tons of tiny details put into the movie made me pleasantly surprised. For example, how real those moments in school felt before Miles was spider man. All that talk about puberty had me dying.So, I'm conclusion, if you like action movies, see this movie. If you like comedy, see this movie. If you like superheroes, see this movie. Absolutely incredible film, and well deserving of a 10/10","

And there are some ""spider-man"" that, in my opinion, are not actually spider-man. What I'm saying is that there are some things that are too much at the edge of the concept of Spider-Man.

Also, there is a girl character from Japanese cartoon. The motivation of the movie is confusing, too. It is really unnecessary to make such a movie. Perhaps it is politically correct to think : why does the spider-man have to be a white? It could also be a black. OK, why does Jesus Christ have to be a white? He could also be a black. Well, cash grab should be another motivation, as Sony does not have much IP. Besides, the premise, or setting, of the film is unconvincing. Why would there be multiple universes?","

"Slarkshark","7 November 2020","This is the Spider-Man we know and love. Consider this a sequel to the original trilogy with Tobey Maguire. In my opinion and many others, Dad bod Peter Parker is the Tobey version. Just knowing that makes this whole movie so much cooler. But trust me, that's not the only thing that makes this film cool, not by a long shot.I will guarantee you have never seen an animated feature like this. This is new, exciting, and the future. Visually superior to everything out there, especially since it's a full length movie, not just a short such as 'Love, Death, & Robots'. The music and sound editing was also amazing and worked so well with all their chosen scenes.Every voice actor was incredible. Though I have to give Jake Johnson the most credit. He is the one who makes us remember why Spider-Man is so beloved and the most relatable when it comes to superheroes. He has been through so much and keeps on getting up, but he's tired and beaten down. He's gone through those struggles and trials that we all endure in life. However, he receives new hope and a desire to fix the wrongs in his life. Some of the other characters are a little out there, but hey it's a multi-verse so it works.I have no reservations in saying this is by far the best Spider-Man movie we have had since the first two in the Sam Raimi/Tobey Maguire trilogy; it may even be better. When I first saw the trailer I said sarcastically ""oh great another Spider-Man movie, just what we need"". Little did I know at the time, but that statement could actually not be more true. I in no way expected it to be this good.",NA
"Derache","6 January 2019","The character was a mediocre mess.
The art style was decent, the characters were either undeveloped, unnecessary, or both, the plot was mediocre at best, and the soundtrack was misplaced and misused.I believe this movie is another hyped up nerd movie just like black panther.",NA
"thegldt","18 December 2018","""Another Spider-Man movie,"" you ask? Get excited as 'Spider-Verse' breathes new life into our familiar friendly neighborhood hero. It is slickly and gorgeously animated in a way I have never seen Western cinema attempt before. This is the closest we will get to a comic book coming to life.For a movie jam-packed with main characters, they find a fun and extremely efficient way to introduce them all without getting too repetitive or too dumbed-down. Minimal expositional dialogue gives way to creative visual devices and recalls that are implemented so satisfyingly because they treat the audience like the smart people that we are.If you are looking for humor (meta or slapstick), lessons on power and responsibility, shocking twists (for non-comic book readers), meaningful cameos, tear-jerking emotional scenes, action-packed sequences, then you are ready to swing into this universe. I, for one, am sucked into this Spider-Verse. And I don't want out.",NA
"Husain_anusif","9 May 2021","I gave this movie a chance
Again, but I didn't see anything worth my time. Is this a Spiderman movie? And why was the animation hurting my eyes, blurry and confused?In short, I did not like the movie at all.",NA
"silverlve","24 December 2018","This movie was such a great bundle of fun, it's colorful, crazy active and so funny. It moves like a living comic book at times with so much action and laughs thrown in.
Loved how the story flowed, the characters all had great personalities and the build to the climax will keep you on the edge. Can't wait to own this one.",NA
"March_Ery","16 December 2018","My expections were pretty high and the movie delivers on every section. First of all the visuals and the overall cinematography. Unbelievable. It's a piece of art. The various styles of animation are so beautiful put together. So much emotions were triggered. It's really funny (not like the typical Marvelstuff), sometimes sad, exciting. Everyting. The dialogue feels fresh and just the flow of the movie is so good. Instantly one of my favourite animated movies of all time and for sure the best Spiderman movie ever made.",NA
