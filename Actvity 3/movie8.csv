"Coventry","10 December 2003","I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it.
I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations. Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.","

"kylopod","15 October 2005","I have enjoyed most of the computer-animated films made so far, ranging from Pixar films like ""Toy Story"" and ""The Incredibles"" to DreamWorks films like ""Shrek."" But ""Finding Nemo"" is the one that remains unparalleled, not because of its comedy or creativity, both of which are equaled in the ""Toy Story"" movies and in ""Monsters Inc.,"" but because it truly, more than any of the previous computer-animated features, reinvents the genre of the children's animated film.Humor in traditional animation is usually based on broad slapstick and physical exaggeration. There are occasional nods to this brand of humor in ""Finding Nemo,"" as when a flock of seagulls ram into a boat and we see their beaks crowing on the other side of the sail. But such sequences only call attention to how far this movie generally departs from old cartoon conventions. Instead, the movie invests its world of sentient animals with a surprisingly scientific texture. All of the animals are based on real species. The fish tank is constructed out of real devices. There is a strong sense of locale, as Marlin (Albert Brooks) travels across the Pacific to Australia, where even the animals speak with an Australian accent. In a scene that I'm sure Gary Larson of ""Far Side"" fame loved, a pelican discusses with a group of fish the intricate details of dentistry. The fact that the animals talk and understand what's going on is treated as though it were a natural feature of the world. The realism is so striking that by the end of the film, you'll almost believe it possible for fish to plot an escape from a tank.Far from making the film pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but still entertaining picture. Most of the humor is based on parodies of human behavior: repentant sharks start a club that's like Alcoholics Anonymous, a school of fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves into spectacular patterns, and a four-year-old girl behaves like most kids that age, oblivious and destructive. The manner in which Marlin finds his way to his son is so inventive that we can forgive the film for the number of coincidences involved.The story employs the same basic formula used in ""Toy Story,"" in which two characters, one uptight and the other clueless, are thrown together as they're forced to journey through a world populated by creatures that are a lot more knowing than the humans realize. This movie, however, creates a unique character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a real human disorder is risky, to say the least, and I'm glad the filmmakers didn't lose the nerve to include this ingenious device, which not only generates some of the film's biggest laughs, but reinforces the character interaction that is so central to the story. This is in fact the only Pixar film to feature true character development. In the course of his voyage, Marlin learns to be more adventurous, getting parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced by the film's director Andrew Stanton, while his son Nemo learns to be self-reliant.Of course, none of the sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans that Marlin encounters along the way really mean any harm. They're just doing what they do. As Nigel the Pelican tells Nemo at one point, ""Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat."" That's perhaps the film's most interesting insight, that there are no true villains, just creatures that act according to their nature, and a few that transcend it.","

"Buddy-51","28 November 2003","Has there ever been a better-looking feature-length animated film than `Finding Nemo'?  We doubt it.  With its shimmering underwater landscapes - be they in the vast immensity of a limitless ocean or the cramped confines of a dentist office aquarium - the film sports a look unlike anything we have ever seen before.  The fish tank setting, in particular, is a veritable wonderland of eye-popping, many-hued visual splendor.Although the script by Andrew Stanton doesn't scale the comedic heights of, say, `Aladdin,' `Shrek' or `Toy Story 2,' it still sparkles with enough wit and inventiveness to entrance youngsters and beguile the grownups who will be joining them in their viewing.  I hasten to point out that the screenplay is blessedly free of all the double entendres and off-color humor that have blighted so much alleged `kiddie' fare in recent years.  This is a film on e can watch with one's children and grandchildren and not once have to blush or turn away in embarrassment while doing so.  Creators of children's films please take note (and take note, too, of its phenomenal box office take).Like many tales designed for the junior set (`Dumbo,' `Bambi' etc.), `Finding Nemo' taps into the fear all children have of being separated from their parents - and the concomitant fear all parents have of being separated from their children.  It is upon this common ground that members of both generations will meet in their emotional response to this film.  In this case, it is little Nemo, an adorable clownfish, who is plucked out of the ocean and plunked down into the saltwater aquarium of a dentist in Sydney, Australia.  The subject of the film's title is Marlin, Nemo's overprotective, worrywart dad who swims his way towards the continent to find and rescue his little tyke.  Along the way, this Nervous Nellie parent learns a little something about giving his son the freedom a boy needs to grow up and become a man, and Nemo, himself, learns a thing or two about just what kind of a fish his dad really is.Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are brilliant as Marlin and Dory, respectively, the latter a befuddled, daffy and utterly good-natured fish who helps Marlin in his epic quest not only for his lost son but his own definition of filial love.  Those familiar with these two fine comedic talents in their live-action performances will actually be able to see many of their distinctive inflections and facial expressions reflected in the animated characters they are portraying.As directed by Stanton and Lee Unkrich, and executed by an army of wonder-working animators and technicians, `Finding Nemo' takes PIXAR technology to its ultimate, final level of perfection - till the studio's next release, that is.","

"mjw2305","22 January 2005","Those guys and girls at Disney/Pixar have done it again, they've created the perfect underwater world, full of fascinating Disney characters.A truly enchanting story of a father (Marlon) who loses his son (Nemo), and with help of his new found friend (Dory) ventures out into the ocean to try to find him. On this epic voyage he gets to battle sharks, surf with some turtle dudes, dice with some jellyfish and survive an encounter in a whales stomach.All the characters are vibrant with Disney charm, but my favourite is Dory, the comic relief, probably one of the funniest Disney characters ever written and superbly voiced by Ellen DeGeneres, pure genius.All in all this is another success for Disney and Pixar, It brings out the child in all of us.Solid family fun 8/10","

"MovieAddict2016","28 July 2003","Pixar Animation Studios has a very good knack for making thoughtful, intelligent and humorous family films (note that I didn't say kid films). ""Toy Story"" 1 & 2 and ""Monsters, Inc."" are some of my favorite family films; ""Finding Nemo"" isn't one of my favorites, but it isn't disappointing like ""A Bug's Life,"" and it is thoughtful, intelligent, humorous and incredibly watchable, just like the other Pixar films.As always, Pixar takes a world of something and completely builds their story around it. In ""Toy Story"" they gave life to toys and created the world through their eyes. In ""Monsters, Inc.,"" they showed us the monster world. In my review on ""A Bug's Life,"" I said that the reason the film didn't work very much is because it was about bugs, and not about something mystical like toys or monsters that bring back childhood memories. Well, I guess I was sorta wrong, because ""Finding Nemo"" is all about fish, nothing too mystical about fish, and I still loved it.This tale takes place underwater with the fish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), whose spouse and baby fish eggs get eaten by a vicious shark in the beginning. All but one egg which Marlin names Nemo.Years later Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould, Elliot's son?) is a bit older, and heading off to fish school for the first time. But haunted by the fact that his spouse and offspring were all killed years ago, Marlin is extremely over-protective of his one remaining family member. Nemo, sick of being treated like a baby, proves how brave he is by swimming near a fishing boat, only to be captured by a scuba-diving dentist. And so Marlin heads off to find Nemo, with the help of his newfound companion Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss and forgets things sooner than she can carry whatever she is doing out. (Like when she is showing Marlin the way towards a fishing boat and suddenly forgets why Marlin is following her.)Pixar doesn't let down the audience on this film. There are a few things that one can always expect from Pixar films: They can expect something (such as toys) to be given their own world. They can expect that world to be given careful attention to detail. And they can expect humor.""Finding Nemo"" gives fish their own world, and the underwater realm they live in is paid careful attention, painstakingly captured on film with computer graphics. And the humor is always there. All the characters are funny. I especially like the sequences from the inside of a fish tank in the dentist's office, with a bunch of fish including Gill (Willem Dafoe's vocal talents), who constantly tries to escape. By doing so, Gill has suffered major injuries, including landing on the dentist's tools and getting sliced up. This is, of course, a parody of escaping POWs. The fact that Willem Dafoe was in the great war movie ""Platoon"" might have something to do with that.This is taken from my ""Monsters, Inc."" review: ""Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my 'Toy Story' review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of 'Toy Story' and 'Monsters, Inc.,' but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for 'Toy Story 3') and gives them the bare minimum.With ""Finding Nemo,"" I still stick towards what I said. Pixar Animation Studios is probably the best family film company out there right now, I really hope they separate from Disney some day and form their own production company. They know what interests both kids and adults, and it's almost creepy how they can make their films so engaging and fun to watch. This is one to take the kids to, and afterwards, maybe even sneak back into again by yourself.","

"PizzicatoFishCrouch","20 March 2006","Marlin, a nervous and neurotic clownfish is heavily overprotective of his son Nemo, who only wants to explore the sea in its entirety. When Nemo gets caught by a scuba diver and taken away, it is up to Marlin to swallow his own fears and find Nemo. The ensuing search and rescue organized by the him is a mass effort by swimming and flying creatures of all sizes and personalities, such as a threesome of vegetarian sharks, a fish with short term memory and an aged turtle, all helping him realise the error of his ways in restricting himself to just his home.As charming as it is beautiful, Finding Nemo is a joy, both visually and cinematically. The characters are all so appealing and sweet that you want to hug each and every one of them, Nemo and Dory in particular. But the film transcends above just a generic animated film, for there are lessons to be learnt by it too. The film often tells a children's tale from an adult's point of view, with risky situations and emotional soul-searching putting stress on a disjointed family.The sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is brilliance and beauty in every frame. The animation is of all time high for Pixar, and the sound mixing and editing are also to be credited, as they capture the heart of the sea creditably. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the musical score by Thomas Newman. He creates the essence of the sea, as well as the emotions felt by the fish throughout. Note the masterwork that occurs as an upbeat, jovial number quickly escalates into something darker in a matter of minutes. In short, the music is superb.The voice cast are capable and cannily chosen, from young Alexander Gould as the naïve Nemo, as well as Albert Brooks as the bumbling Marlin. But the star of the show is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. As the forgetful but caring fish, she is sweet and soulful, and provides much of the comedy of the film. But the humour is also provided by the great script, which delivers a potentially dull story with wit and soul, and shies away from the sentimentality that could so easily arise of a Disney film. And the jokes, what jokes  from satire, spoof and slapstick, they'll be a one-liner for everybody here.Gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable, Finding Nemo sets the standard for how animated movies should being terms of entertainment value as well as story and themes  ending with the touching, thought-provoking message of how too much protectiveness on the parent's side will repel, but, no matter how independent a child (or fish) believes themselves to be, they'll always need their parents.","

"Boba_Fett1138","11 January 2004","""Finding Nemo"" is a wonderful animated adventure movie that simply is irresistible for young as well as older persons.The most excellent thing about ""Finding Nemo"" is the perfect timing, just like in ""Monsters, Inc"" the jokes are extremely well placed in a quick pace and are good for more then just a few laughs.There are some very fun and great characters which brings me to the only problem I have with this movie. There are too many minor characters, I would have really loved to see some of the characters getting a bigger role with some more importance to the story instead of meeting character after character that are only on screen for no more than 5 minutes (such as the sharks). Sure it's good for the sense of adventure but it leaves some missed opportunities to make the story even more fun.I think it's pretty obvious that the story is inspired on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy since it uses lot's of elements from it and it has the some feeling of adventure and excitement so it's really not a big thing that the story isn't very original, the original and fun way the story is told in compensates for this.The voice cast as in many animated movies is impressive but the one that stood out was Ellen DeGeneres as Dory that you love to hate.Irresistible movie for the whole family with great jokes and lines and some memorable characters and situations.

"lhseaglerunner","5 June 2003","Remember back when you were little.you know, back when tall to you was about as high as a mailbox? In those days, Disney animated films (e.g. `Lion King' and `Beauty and the Beast') were some of the coolest things out there and were movies to watch over and over (much to your parents' chagrin). Now, animated movies aren't exactly the `coolest' things to see, but an exception can be made for the uber-hip Pixar movies, the most recent of which being `Finding Nemo'.After losing all but one of his brood, Marlin (Albert Brooks) an over-protective clown fish that strangely lacks a sense of humor, has resolved to protect his one (slightly disabled) `child' remaining, Nemo (Alexander Gould). But disaster strikes as Nemo is taken by a Sydney dentist and plopped into a fish tank where he is comforted by a host of other captive fish (William Dafoe, Vicki Lewis, Allison Janney, et al). But back in the big ocean Down Under, Marlin has resolved to search out his one remaining progeny.Along the way on his quest, Marlin acquires a tag-along `friend', Dory (Ellen DeGeneres)-a fish with, well, the memory capacity of a fish. The two must surmount hurdles like a group of sharks (Eric Bana, Barry Humphries and Bruce Spence) that have (mostly) sworn off eating other fish, a nasty swarm of jellyfish, a bird-brained flock of seagulls, and others.This is the bridge! Well, in a way. Back when I was younger, one of my favorite films was `The Incredible Mr. Limpet', which, for the uninitiated, combined live-action with under-the-sea fish animation. What Pixar has done here was bring back that film to my mind and start me thinking, because they have created a wondrous undersea environment (with `normal-looking' fish instead of 1960s animated fish).My favorite feature in this movie chock-full of sweet treats must be the sharks. I have always been partial to the shark family, but what has been done in creating three humorous sharks (what a movie concept), just sent paroxysms of laughter through me. Another thing that (mostly) works is Ellen DeGeneres' fish (character?) that provides a fairly constant source of laughter with her antics (although a couple gags do wear on the viewer with time). On the whole though, there is not a single bit of shoddy voice-acting or animation in it.Compared to `Monsters Inc.', `Finding Nemo' is something of a revival for Pixar. I like how they have stepped up their efforts to make an altogether pleasing film without any big flaws. The thing that I did not like with `Monsters' was the inclusion of a single key (but EXTREMELY annoying) character. Director Andrew Stanton has done an excellent job at making the film work and be (basically) non-annoying to most of the general public (and this critic).I suppose life has come full circle-now that I am (relatively) old as a high school graduate, animation is cool again, thanks to high-powered computers, at any rate. `Finding Nemo' is one heckuva movie and a good one to take anyone you know to, trust me on this-nine out of ten.","

"nadger_09","12 August 2003","Pixar Studios have done it again. I have to say that these guys are totally good in computer animation, as well as in storytelling. Rarely do those qualities come together but here they are, delivering unto the audience once again something that one can only be drowned with wonder. Such is the marvel of Finding Nemo.The story is about Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould), a young clownfish who is fed up with his dad Marlin's (Albert Brooks) excessive paranoia over him. He swims to a place where his dad forbids him and ends up being captured by a scuba diver. He is then placed in a fish tank in a dental clinic somewhere along the harbors of Sydney. Thus the quest of Marlin, along with Dory (a hilarious forgetful blue tang voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) to find Nemo before it's too late.The story is a simple one but where the film more than makes up is on the overwhelming sense of detail and rich, lavish colors and textures as if we aren't really watching an animated film at all. Scenes such as Marlin bringing Nemo to school while swimming through corals and anemones, to the aquarium where Nemo was taken to, are nothing short of breathtaking, and undoubtedbly one of the most outstanding animation ever to hit the screen.The world of ""Finding Nemo"" is simply alive with lovable creatures swimming about their daily lives under the ocean, darting across the screen in playful manners. The viewer almost literally dives into another world for nearly two hours and one cannot help but be completely captivated.
The music and screenplay also blend very well with the visual feast that it produces such a high quality movie. From its basic storyline, to the father-and-son relationship theme, to the wonderful underwater world throughout, this is really an adventure through an ocean of stunning visuals and storytelling.Grade: A","

"Sleepin_Dragon","15 November 2023","Marlin loses his wilful son Nemo, and the fact that 71% of the Earth is water, that's a lot of water to find a single fish.Back to a time where Disney Pixar were giving us truly memorable, meaningful and wonderful films. Finding Nemo surely rates as one of the great animations.This film is both funny and moving, it's a film that that whole family can enjoy, I'm sure this will end up on over thr upcoming Christmas period, it usually does, and it always makes us giggle, Ellen DeGeneres truly does provide the laughs as dippy Dory.I'm only surprised to that the followup took so long, and though I don't think Finding Dory is quite as good, it's still worth seeing.As much as I adore Dory, it's Bruce that I like most, his animation is just perfect.It's moving, it's funny, there is definitely a meaningful story, the animation remains terrific.9/10.","

"TheLittleSongbird","3 May 2009","This movie is just gorgeous to look at, really the animation is just stunning, with the blue backgrounds and colourful characters. My only criticism is that although there are some very funny moments, like Doreen speaking whale(Ellen DeGeneres was born to speak whale, really she was) and Barry Humphries's shark, I don't think it is as laugh-out loud funny as Toy Story. Finding Nemo is definitely the most beautiful visually of the Pixar movies, I would certainly pick it over Cars. The music by Thomas Newman was just beautiful, and I always look out for this in a movie, and it was a delight hearing ""Beyond the Sea"" over the end credits. The characters are genuinely memorable, especially Doreen and Bruce. And who can forget the girl Darla, with the Psycho music?(that is really terrifying)The voice talents are very good indeed, especially Ellen DeGeneres, and I liked Willem Dafoe's Gil. Albert Brooks made a wonderfully paranoid father figure, and I loved the plot about Marlin's son Nemo being taken by divers and Marlin (a clown fish) racing to find him. That is simple, but we meet characters like the turtle, so the film is filled with fun, enough to satisfy the fussiest child. In conclusion, 9/10 for the visuals and the characters. Outstanding!

"moviemanMA","10 July 2005","Can Pixar and Disney miss with a film? Both Toy Story's, A Bugs Life, Monster's Inc., Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles. These movies are instant classics.The movie in focus is Finding Nemo, a story of a clown fish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), trying to find his son Nemo who was taken away by scuba divers. With the help of a fish named Dory (Ellen Degeneres)Marlin bumps into on his journey, they set out on finding Nemo. The only problem is that Dory suffers from short-term memory loss. She can't remember anything except her name. It's sad but brings a lot of comedy to the movie.Along the way they meet some priceless characters like Crush (voiced by writer/director Andrew Stanton), the thrill seeking sea turtle. They also encounter a trio of friendly sharks, Bruce, Anchor, and Chum. They have sworn to never eat a fish again. They also run into some potentially deadly situations with an ugly deep sea fish, also a huge swarm of jellyfish, and a whale. Marlin and Dory must tough it out and make it to find Nemo.Meanwhile, Nemo is now the new addition to an Australian dentist's office aquarium. There he meets some interesting characters. Peach the starfish, Bloat the blowfish, and more sea dwellers. There Nemo tries to fit in, becoming a member of the tank named ""Shark Bait"". He tries to help out Gill (William Defoe) with his plan to escape from the tank and get everyone out. Nemo must come through in order to see his father ever again. A local pelican named Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) also tries to help out in the escape. Word has spread around the world of Marlin's trip to find his son, reaching Nigel.FInding Nemo is an instant classic. With great lines and unforgettable characters, this movie is a delight. The animation itself is remarkable. It's as though the fish are really swimming. You can even see particles floating in the water. Light shines through and currents make the fish and surrounding react. The animators have done their homework for this picture.This movie is quite an experience. It is a film the whole family can enjoy for years to come. It is a timeless adventure that people can enjoy. Don't let this film drift out to sea...","

"tedg","13 June 2003","Spoilers herein.Steve Jobs drags us all into higher awareness. He does so by grabbing our attention by conventional means but does his real work subliminally.In the computer world, what we see is a coherent, accessible approach with appealing style. In the movie world we see the same, except the art of excellent character development and storytelling is substituted for sheer functionality and ease of creativity. In both, we all are pulled by this tractor into a more refined space.And space is what it is all about, in particular a notion of location in space coupled with a higher degree of freedom within that space.This has been a concern of intelligent filmmakers all along. Griffith merged the theatrical space with grand vistas of mass movement and did so from a spot no human would normally have. Welles and Kurosawa played with this, the first by working with architecture, the other by flattening in deep focus. But until the eighties we always had to deal with the reality of the ground -- and the horizon.The real appeal of ""Star Wars"" wasn't the cowboy story or guns, nor the pseudo-religious trappings, though we all thought it was. It was the freedom from that hard bottom, the Earth which we interact with in as consistently as breath and blood. ""Star Wars"" -- and ""2001"" before -- gave a thrill because our visual vocabulary was now expanded spatially rather than ALWAYS being referenced to the floor.Pixar's work has always been cognizant of this new frontier even when owned by Lucas. Under Jobs, every film has become more and more dimensional until now. We don't honk around with the camera as much as I would like, but we do set a new standard for interacting space. Naturally, all else is well crafted but serves this notion of space ? especially the fishtank business.Ted?s Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.","

The images were so great, the storyline was typical but fun, the characters were well-defined, and the sound was emotive and effective.  And, who could not love a flick that makes references to The Shining, Psycho, and other quality films?I seriously got attached to the little Clown fish, Nemo.  The movie just sucked me in.  Anyway, watch it.  It's worth your time, especially if you enjoy Pixar animation.  The first 10 minutes is a visual overload in a good way.

"vip_ebriega","23 October 2008","My Take: Simply magical, down to the last computer-animated detail. I was at least 13 or 14 years old when this came out, and only now am I reviewing it. But that can't stop me, I have to lay out my sentiments for this clever and occasionally brilliant animated achievement. Not only is it the best, so far, in Pixar's portfolio of animated films, it's one of the very best animated films ever made, period. FINDING NEMO is a well-told fairy tale adventure, but a well-told story is only a bonus compared to the film's awesome look and feel. The movie is visually stunning, with images that flow like living paintings, some of which almost but leaps out the screen. The movie is beautifully crafted, and sometimes, I almost didn't care about anything else. Almost.On the contrary, the story is quite simple. After a tragedy introduced in the opening scenes, Marlin the clown fish (voiced by Albert Brooks) becomes too over-protective of his last son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould). Every move he makes is always under the watchful eye of his over-protective father, who couldn't afford to lose him. To prove that he can walk with his own two feet (or is that swim with his own fins?), Nemo approached an anchored divers boat and is abducted by two curious divers and taken far off the Great Barrier Reef. Marlin, guilty for his loss, is determined to find his son, captured by a dentist and placed inside a too-small-for-a-fish aquarium in the dentist's clinic. Along his side is a joyous yet forgetful fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who gives a helping fin a long the way, whatever she can remember.This is quite an adventure too. Not only are we introduced to a closer-than-life-like reef, we are also introduced with a clever and elaborate band of characters, including a trio of sharks who swore their lives to be vegetarians (until the call of the wild kicks in), a couple of surfer-dude turtles, a charade-playing school of fish and many other wonders. The animation here is, by far, the most brilliant ones I have ever seen. A colorful and life-filled reef, a forest of jellyfish and a crystal-clear aquarium filled of plastic ornaments have never looked more pristine in this lavish and elaborate adventure. But other than its brilliant design which is considerable enough to recommend the picture, the film is not without a good story, and it is told well. The characters have a great deal of features and characteristics. This is most evident on the character of Dory, who not only has the showmanship of the voice who dubbed her, but also the delight we expect from a true family film.If the story may not apply to you, or you might find it cliché, then FINDING NEMO will still do as a brilliant eye-candy, with one of the best sights I have ever seen in an animated film then and now. Sometimes, sitting in front of a theater or even the small screen and just let the elaborate visuals flow right through you is more than enough to see a movie. Sometimes it's a movie like this one that reminds you the fun that going to movies are.Rating: ***** out of 5.","

"bob the moo","30 September 2003","Scarred by the loss of his wife and eggs, Marlin has over sheltered his only child, Nemo.  However when Nemo's first day at school comes about, that mothering leads Nemo to swim out to the open ocean where he is caught by a scuba diver and be put in a fish tank far away.  Enlisting help from the forgetful Dory, Marlin tracks the boat and his ocean adventure begins.Now as much as a tradition as national holidays, the latest Pixar animation arrives in the UK on a wave (d'oh!) of hype and marketing.  Officially the biggest summer film in the US and all over buses and Happy Meals (which seems a little perverse when you think about it) it is hard not to want to see it or prevent your kids from demanding they see it.  Happily the well establish benchmark of being kiddie friendly but fun for adults is maintained and the film does exactly what you know it will.  The plot is a little like Toy Story's quest but is fleshed out enough to be interesting and the themes of `letting go' and loss are actually quite well handled and will speak more to adults than kids.The slight problem with the film is that is does do just what you expect and the `animated film with adult wit and kiddie characters' stuff is hardly cutting edge anymore.  However this is a picky flaw as it is still very good fun.  It may not be the strongest of this genre, indeed some bits flag and the sentimental core, while a break from cruel humour or sarcasm, does then to slow things down a bit at times.The adult references are all good but not as frequent as I'd have liked  they seem to be separate from the main flow where I wanted them integral with all of it.  Clever homage's to Jaws (Bruce was the pet name of the rubber shark) and The Birds are distracting and make you feel good about yourself, and the banter is mostly witty if lacking a real sharpness at times.The voice cast are all good are quite an all star bunch.  Brooks does a workmanlike job in the lead  it must be said I didn't think he distinguished himself but then he did have to carry the moral weight of the film.  DeGeneres is much better and her dippy character is a delight at times.  The support cast is not as deep and fun as in other films  Janney and Dafoe are both fun in the tank (as are all the tank characters) it's just that none of them are really consistent.  My favourite characters were the one word seagulls  `mine?'Overall I have been unfair to this film in my review.  If I saw this in isolation I would be praising it to the roof, however using the others as a benchmark this does have a few weaknesses that show signs of wear and tear in the genre.  Not to cancel everything I have said, these weaknesses are all things that I realised after I had watched it  while I was watching it I was too busy laughing!  Biggest downside for me though  no comedy outtakes, booooooo!","

"departed07","11 May 2005","Pixar has made some of the enjoyable films in the past years: The Toy Story films, Monsters, Inc., and A Bug's Life to name a few. What makes these films interesting is the designs of the films as if they look identical to real life; now the creators have made underwater more realistic than ever in ""Finding Nemo"" where the waves of the water seem to have life of its own.""Finding Nemo"" is a story of a clown fish name Marlin (Albert Brooks) who takes on the responsibility of his young son Nemo after the mother and the babies were killed off screen. Now as a single parent, Marlin worries about everything that his young son does, even when he goes off to school for the first day.There is a universal moment in about every Pixar movie where there is always a human nature to relate towards the animated films; with Marlin's parental worries as a single father, most of the dads in the audiences can relate to him, especially when Nemo is kidnapped by a sea diver after getting near a boat.Marlin goes through the sea of Australia where he meets with a blue coral fish name Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who has STM (Short Term Memory) where she can remember things and than forget until the final moment. They go on adventures from escaping sharks, getting sting by jellyfish, swimming with turtles and going inside a whale's mouth.As for Nemo, he's inside a fish tank in a dentist office where he meets with characters that have been capture by the dentist; the leader of the pack is Gil (Willem Defoe of Spider-Man) who has been trying to free a bunch of sea-animals and with Nemo, they have a chance.""Finding Nemo"" is funny and touching where like any other film, where audiences get to learn a lesson about letting go of their young ones as they go out into the world, but also have a good time.","

"Horst_In_Translation","1 December 2015","""Finding Nemo"" is an American animated movie from 12 years ago and certainly one of the most known animated films in history, not only because it is an Oscar winner, but because it solidified Pixar's and Disney's collaborative efforts that went on till this date. I personally see a couple parallels to the classic ""Little Mermaid"" from almost 15 years earlier. Of course, the film takes place almost entirely under the sea, but it is also about a difficult father-child relationship and about one part of that relationship in particular, namely finding the right approach to life and letting go, i.e. find a way that will actually help him bond with his offspring again. A great film for fathers. There is not that much memorable music in here, but also lots of heart, even if a crucial love story is missing. I'm not sure if I would call Marlin/Dory one and if I do, then it's still not the core plot of the film.Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich are obviously known to everybody with an interest in animated films from the last years. Same probably goes for Bob Peterson, who is a voice actor in here as well. Still, there are also ""real"" actors lending their voices to characters in this one, such as Albert Brooks, Willem Dafoe, Allison Janney or Geoffrey Rush, a personal favorite of mine. He fits nicely in here with the Australian background. Nothing to say about the animation in this 100-minute movie. It's really good. The characters are all interesting and almost all of them fun too. Even the scary sharks bring some comedy when they try to work on their image problem early on. The only really scary creatures in here were the jellyfish. Oh wait, that's not correct. The fishermen were 10 times scarier and also with the final breaking free scene probably the main antagonists.I personally would say I enjoyed this film, but I also think one watch is enough. The story is fine, but it does not work on an emotional level for me as it aspires. With the exception of the truly sad prologue and Dory's ""I don't wanna forget."" maybe. The comedy is pretty good from start to fi(ni)sh with all its funny scenes and dialogs, especially Dory's. She is a crucial addition and brings great comic relief during the entire movie. Not too long anymore until we get the sequel to this one. Hopefully they'll come up with something good again, but I am positive they will. It is certainly a challenge to build something around Dory's amnesia, but it looks like they took the possibly easy way out with her gone missing this time, so the story will probably focus more on the two clownfish. Until then, ""Finding Nemo"" is worth checking out in case of the unlikely scenario that you really haven't seen it yet.","

"planktonrules","10 June 2007","Okay, I am NOT a huge Nemo fan, but considering the film's modest pretenses and how much kids loved it, who am I to complain--especially since the animation is so nice? Plus, the film is much, much better than the knock-off film, SHARK TALE.The film has one of the simplest plots I have ever seen in a kids movie. Nemo loves his dad and vice-versa. When Nemo is captured for a home aquarium, the timid dad springs to the rescue with rather predictable results. There are no major surprises BUT the journey along the way is pleasant and cute. The kids will no doubt love it but some parents may find it a bit ""sticky"" and shallow like I did. But considering how much fun my daughter had watching it, this can all be forgiven.","

It is a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that warms your heart from time to time. The sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is excellence and beauty in every frame. Gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable. All the characters are vibrant with Disney charm, but Dory, the comic relief, probably one of the funniest Disney characters ever written and superbly voiced by Ellen DeGeneres. A delight from start to finish.","

"g-bodyl","14 October 2008","Finding Nemo is a very good animated film, probably it's in the top 10 animated features of all time. The story is about a little clown fish named Nemo. He ventures out into the open sea while not listening to his father. He gets captured by a dentist and now his father, marlin has to save him from the clutches of the dentist and his ""evil"" niece. The story of the film is unbelievable. I don't know how a movie about a fish can be very popular. The voice acting is pretty good. The all-star cast did a great job voicing their characters. The music in this film is sweet. The music will lure you more into the movie. The song in the film is great for people who like music 40 years ago. Once again, Pixar did not fail in its ability to make classic animated films. Overall, this is a very good film. I rate this movie 10/10.","

"luke-a-mcgowan","23 August 2015","When I grew up, I always thought the concept of Pixar movies was ""what would life be like as a ____"" Toys were fun, Monsters in the cupboard were fun, bugs were fun, and now we landed on fish. And I loved it because it was colourful and funny and touching.Now, watching Finding Nemo with all I know about film, I am able to understand how brilliant early Pixar was. Every one of these early films has two ""whats life like as"" - one for kids (toys, bugs, monsters) and one for adults. In Finding Nemo, its ""what life is like as an overprotective parent."" Finding Nemo is one of the most beautiful stories that can appeal to families that I've ever seen.The film opens with one of the most downright upsetting moments I ever watched as a child. Albert Brooks' perfect voice casting really captures the grief and desperation that Marlin feels, and it so perfectly sets the stage for the rest of the film. Every one of Marlin's overprotective scenes is not completely justified, but so believable to come from him. We also enjoy Ellen DeGeneres' delightful sidekick Dory, who is absolutely hilarious and charming and I could not love her presence more. As Marlin and Dory set out on the titular quest, Pixar does what Pixar does best - gives us a funny and wondrous understanding of their universe. A gang of sharks are recovering addicts from fish flesh. Seagulls are sadistic and brainless. A group of sea turtles are perpetually high. Throughout each of the encounters, not only does Marlin learn more about the ocean he has been afraid of for so long, but he learns about how his overprotective parenting isn't going to help Nemo forever, and he's better off learning to take care of himself wherever he can.Meanwhile, Nemo is confined in a dentist's tank with a gaggle of kooky fish characters, each of whom has their own little ticks because of their confinement (a beautiful little addition to the story). Emmy king and queen Brad Garrett and Allison Janney are hilarious and even funnier is the addition of Academy Award winner Geoffrey Rush, who pops in as a Pelican taking an interest in dental hygiene. The film's story is so perfectly constructed that I can't fault it. The catalyst moments are spread out by moments of character development and sprinkled with perfect doses of humour. Even the final challenge doesn't come across as ""just one more obstacle"" but provides closure on Marlin's overparenting and provides his first real test. Thomas Newman's serene score keeps things moving along at a beautiful pace, and the animation is as superb as anything we've come to expect from Pixar.Finding Nemo is just a delight, pure and simple. Its a lesson to kids and parents alike, but its also so colourful and funny that its a fun watch just when you're feeling flat. Perfect for all occasions.","

"Victor Field","25 October 2003","A number of folks have complained about ""Finding Nemo"" not being up to the standards of ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" - and it's true that it's not perfect; when you think about it, the Andrew Stanton/Bob Peterson/David Reynolds script has a slightly similar plot to the adventures of Buzz, Woody et al (for a toy being taken read a little clownfish missing). Plus the movie suffers from a few too many climaxes (probably because unlike most American animated features, this has a three-figure running time), and there's a definite sign of a formula to Pixar movies.But we'd be so much better off if all movies had it: Pixar movies have proper screenplays, packed with wit and warmth (and restraint - like the pinnacle of the climax of ""A Bug's Life,"" the horrible incident that launches the movie takes place off screen); they have good casts performing the characters, with a particular nod here to Ellen DeGeneres, Geoffrey Rush, Barry Humphries and Willem Dafoe (though one wishes Nemo had a bit more dimension to him); they have plenty of effort put into the look of the movie (one of the strongest achievements is that the undersea world of the Pacific is a lot more comforting than the dry land world of Australia, so that you feel alarmed whenever the action cuts to Sydney); and they have the sense to not go overboard with any cultural references.It has to be said that it's a bit slow going at first, but fears that it'll be Pixar's first real disappointment are soon allayed; with some impressive animation, plenty of fine moments throughout and a wonderful score from Thomas Newman that gives the proceedings a breath of fresh musical air after his cousin Randy's efforts (so when can we expect David Newman to work for Pixar?), this ultimately ends up as another good effort from the bouncing lamp - who else would have a family movie include the music credit ""'The Murder' Written By Bernard Herrmann"" (it serves as the ""theme"" for an Elmyra Duff type who Nemo's in great danger from in the air-breathers' world)? It goes without saying that staying for the closing titles is a must, Robbie Williams's undesired song notwithstanding - no ""outtakes"" this time, but never mind.""I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine. And he shall be my Squishy.""","

"faraaj-1","8 October 2006","Finding Nemo is one of a series of Pixar animation features made in past decade or so and is probably the best of the lot. My three year old watches the DVD at least twice a week and doesn't show any sign of getting tired. The reason is obvious - Finding Nemo creates a complete under the sea world inhabited by creatures with complete personalities.The plot has Marlin, a clown fish, losing his only child Nemo (named after Capt.Nemo of 20,000 leagues under the the sea) to a deep sea diver. While Nemo is stuck in a fish tank in a dental office with lots of other interesting characters, Marlin sets out to find his son. On the way, a crazy blue fish called Dory joins him and turns this into something of a buddy movie (although Dory is female)......There are lots of jokes peppered throughout the movie with Dory supplying a large chunk of them. Writer-director Stanton plays a 'dude' 150 year old sea turtle straight from the 60's and adds to the fun. The visuals are superb, storyline is great and it all makes for a great adventure. I rate this 9/10 because I'm a little sick and tired of seeing it on the DVD every weekend for over a year now!!","

"CMTiago","4 October 2014","Having watched this movie back when I was in my 8/9 years of age, Finding Nemo struck me as a very funny movie and I, of course, loved Dory and her quirkiness. Over time I began to appreciate the emotional impact of the story and the detail that went into the animation process, which in turn led to the establishment of this movie as my favorite of all time. Having only been surpassed three years ago by Toy Story 3 (another Pixar gem), Finding Nemo still holds a strong impression on me, as well as remaining one of my top 10 movies and my second favorite animated movie.The plot follows a clown fish named Marlin, that after his son is taken by a human, sets out on a dangerous and treacherous journey to get him back. Along the way he will meet Dory, a blue fish that suffers from short term memory loss. Together they will stop at nothing to get to Nemo, Marlin's son, who along with a group of ragtag aquarium fish will also plan to escape to the ocean in order to avoid a bratty, but, deadly child and get back to his dad.So like I said, there 3 reasons why I love this movie. The first one is the comedy, provided mostly by the goofy sidekick Dory, as well as other characters. The combination of the smart script, plus the voice talent involved makes for the great comedic side of Finding Nemo. The other great quality of the script, is the emotional turmoil that ensues in the movie, and personally I believe that some parents might resonate with it most, even though I myself do not know this reality. Finally Pixar proves why they are the top of the animation game, by assembling the proper research and creating a great oceanic world, as well as the Sydney landscape.Finding Nemo will forever be a cinematic mark in my cinematic history. It is a funny, energetic and entertaining picture, and that is all I can ask from a movie like this. Rating: 10/10","

"MattBirk","17 March 2016","Finding Nemo is Pixar's crown jewel and one of the best animated movies of all time! They create an entire world under water, it looks beautiful, but it also captures the scarier things below the surface. Together, Dory and Marlin travel the Atlantic ocean in search for Nemo and along they way they run into some of the most bizarre characters imaginable! The audience is in the same position as Marlin, he is exploring the ocean for the first time, just like us as the audience, and it is intoxicating. The ocean to most people is a giant, wonderland full of mystery and you never know what you will run into, and Pixar takes full advantage of that as we meet a variety of characters. Along the way, we are given the treat of having some amazing comedy bits as characters cultures clash amongst one another. But even as we travel across the ocean and back, the core of the story never leaves us, it's a love story about a father and son and it is an emotional roller-coaster. They brilliantly take the most notorious fish movie, Jaws (which made the ocean seem terrifying), and turns it upside down, making the water now seem like a wonderful land full of amazing creatures. Finding Nemo is the epitome of Pixar's imagination and creative abilities, they have made an eternal classic here.Let's hope the sequel lives up to the first film!","

"saska-3","2 June 2003","Fresh off a viewing in a packed theater of kids and parents, my initial impression of ""Finding Nemo"" was that I had a great time throughout, but don't necessarily remember why.  The film is similar to the ""Toy Story"" pacing, in that we follow two different protagonists in their attempt to return to one another.  In brief summary, Marlin the overprotective father clownfish must overcome his own fear of open ocean to try and find his only son, Nemo, who has been captured by a diver and transplanted to an ocean-view dentist's office fish tank.The visual impact of ""Finding Nemo"" is unparalleled in animated film.  At its best, it compares to the experience of seeing the sweeping landscapes of ""Fellowship of the Ring"" for the first time - not until we own the DVD and my son has watched it a dozen times will I really have an opportunity to see the details crammed into the lush backgrounds of the coral reefs.  It was noticeable, however, that frequent close-ups in open water were used to reduce the amount of time spent rendering those brilliant backgrounds.  In comparison to Pixar films like ""A Bug's Life"", where every moment of the film includes rich textures and detailed background perspective, this seemed jarring at times.  It should be noted that this is true to what the ocean looks like - if you're not diving in a coral reef, you are probably seeing a lot of floating detritus and gray water - but it's worth mentioning that the fish tank environment of Nemo and his fellow captives is, at times, more interesting than the open ocean.Pixar took chances (or else saved money) with many of the voice actors used in the film.  It was refreshing not to instantly ""know"" a voice was familiar in the case of many of the characters - all of them did a serviceable job, although the well-known actors also turned in some of the best performances. Ellen DeGeneres had no fear as the voice of Dory, gleefully pulling off vocal pratfalls that would have been hampered by someone else's sense of dignity.  I can think of only one other actress - Julia Louis-Dreyfuss - who I think would have been able to do Dory well.  Kudos to Ellen.  Willem Dafoe is also noticeably brilliant as Gill, and it's a bonus that the animated character he plays is gorgeously realized.  John Ratzenberger does a hysterical turn as the school of fish we all saw in the previews.I am surprised at the number of characters whose voices are not credited in this film.  I wanted to know, among others, who voiced Mr. Ray the schoolteacher and the trio of parents with whom Marlin banters.I laughed out loud frequently and heartily throughout the film, but at the end, I looked back and wondered how those moments of amusement added to the story.  Many people have commented that they loved the 12-step program for sharks (""Fish are our friends, not food!"") but in the final analysis, it added very little to the arc and seemed out of character (I realize I'm stating the obvious).  The frequently-dropped comedic digressions were the weak point in this picture, especially compared to ""A Bug's Life"", where the funniest moments of the film are all critical to the progress of the protagonist and impact the end of the story.My 2 and a half year old son was frequently frightened to the point of crying out and grabbing on to me during the movie, and he followed the primary issues easily.  At a particular moment in the film when things seemed hopeless, I heard dozens of young children beginning to cry.  If your child is very affected by scary or dramatic moments in movies, you may want to talk with them about ""pretend"" versus ""real"" and prepare them for the eventuality that everything will turn out all right well before you go into the theater.  His final analysis was that ""the fish movie was good!"" - so take it under advisement if you have kids of similar age.I give ""Finding Nemo"" an 8 out of 10 on the strength of its visual lushness, its enjoyable voice work, and its moments of perfectly timed humor.  It does not, in my opinion, match the strength as a *film* of earlier Pixar offerings, but even in its innocuous state, it's higher quality than most of the family films I've seen in the past 3 years.","

"Lady_Targaryen","30 January 2006","''Finding Nemo'' is one of the sweetest movies I have watched this days. Produced by the both powerful Disney and Pixar with amazing graphics and a nice story, I am not surprised that this movie won the Oscar.In the Ocean, we see Marlin and Coral, a couple of clown fish that are very happy to have kids. But when both Marlin and Coral needs to hide from their predator, Coral stays so worried with the eggs that runs out of their shelter to save them. But the worst happens, and Coral and the eggs are all consumed by the predator. Marlin is devastate, when he sees one little egg that wasn't taken away. He decides to call him 'Nemo'and take care very well of the only son that lasted. Time passes, and Nemo needs to go to school and do other stuff, but his father is always forbidding him because of his trauma with Coral and the other sons. When Marlin finally let Nemo go to the school, he is captured by a scuba diver and taken to live in a dentist office's fish tank. Decided to take his son back, Marlin will find other animals that are very funny and different, like Dory, who is always forgetting things, vegetarian sharks and turtles who are surfers.","

The animation is just beautiful, acting is awesome, the music fit everything that was going on. I could go on and on with this list, but I think I'll stop there. What I liked mostly about this movie was that it didn't lack anything at all. There was just the right amount of comedy, drama, suspense/action, and even romance. And it all blended together beautifully. This is why I gave this movie a full 10. Believe, me if I could give it more, I would.","

"Dockelektro","6 December 2003","God bless Pixar. I am not really religious, but for Pixar, I'll convert. Because they are the precious few, part of the species of that rare kind of filmmakers who necessarily have to check out every detail, every bit and particle of their work, and necessarily turn all of them into sheer brilliancy. Today, Pixar has accostumed us to a pattern of quality beyond measure, not only because their work needs special attention but also because the technical part is only a vessel to something much important: a heart. And since every Pixar film requires half a life and half a soul to make from each and everyone of its founding craftsmen, the results are so exquisite and unique that no other movie can be compared to them. One may wonder about their ""secret"". No secret. Just real feeling and love to their job. ""Finding Nemo"" is the new crowning jewel in Pixar's flawless hall of fame, again a movie based on the buddy formula we love so much, this time in a whole new world: the ocean depths. And the prospect of doing a movie in this setting is probably something for the Pixar artists to drool on: just imagine all the quirky ideas they can have in this unexplored realm. And they deliver, big time. Once more, the filmmakers never opt for the obvious, delivering always the right choices, always turning the right way, and once more transforming all of us mere viewers into big children, just marvelling into the beautiful sights and sounds of the big blue. And they make us travel into all aspects of the possible journey, surprising even the most visionary viewer. The result is one of the most warm movies of the year, one of those movies that makes you come out with a smile and makes you forget about all your problems. If movies are a way to make you feel better, then doctors should be out giving prescriptions of Finding Nemo. Combining intelligence, entertainment and art into one is a gift that few have. Pixar does it a naturally as breathing. And once again the result is nothing short of amazing. Movie magic at its best.","

"grantss","7 November 2014","An animation classic.Good family fun from Disney and Pixar. Entertaining from start to finish, with a touch of emotion too. Some funny moments and a rollicking story. Hardly slows down for a moment.Superb animation - such vivid colours, and a seamless movement effect. Certainly a far cry from the old colour-in-inside-the-lines animation.However, it is probably the voices that make the movie. Superb casting in this regard. Ellen DeGeneres steals the show as Dory but every voice is well-chosen and spot-on. Filled with stars too, so it is often a case of spot-the-voice: Willem Dafoe, Albert Brooks, Geoffrey Rush, Allison Janney, Stephen Root.Kids will love this, and so too will adults.","

"Doylenf","30 June 2005","The underwater visuals here are as gorgeous as anything Disney ever did in PINOCCHIO, and the colors are dazzling enough to keep anyone hypnotized by the lushness of it all.The slender story about an outgoing clown fish, Nemo straying far from his over-protective father (voiced by Albert Brooks) and getting scooped up by a scuba diver (to be deposited in a fish tank), is played for laughs all the way through. Despite all the humor, there are plenty of tense situations that might frighten the very young. The writers have made sure that the plot is a virtual obstacle course full of forces that have to be overcome before the boy becomes a hero who saves the day.Along the way, Nemo's closest pal is the daffy, amnesiac Dory, a bluefish with a terrible memory, voiced by Ellen DeGeneres in what has to be the film's best voice-over. Her lines are all guaranteed to remind you of the comedienne herself and she comes close to stealing the film with her antics.The movie is slanted at the youth market, of course, and kids and their parents will probably both be enchanted and satisfied with the quips that come fast and furious. I had to use the caption feature on my remote to catch all of the one-liners.On an artistic level, the underwater seascape is fascinating to observe and the jaunty background score keeps the pace flowing nicely.My favorites: the seagulls all shouting in unison ""Mine!"" whenever prey was cited and a whole army of them getting their beaks caught in the mast of a ship.","

"garethvk","28 May 2003","The technical magicians at Pixar are back with the new animated film `Finding Nemo' that tells the story of a loving but overprotective Clownfish named Marlin (Albert Brooks), as he ventures out into the deep ocean to save his son Nemo (Alexander Gould), who has been taken from his home by divers.    The loss of Nemo is devastating to Marlin as he lost his wife and all of their eggs save for Nemo and has become very timid in the time since and he fears venturing beyond the safe confines of his home area.
     Driven by the love for his son, Marlin sets out to follow the boat that has taken his son, even though it takes him deep into the dangerous Ocean and forces him to confront his own fears to save his son. Along the way Marlin encounters Dory (Ellen DeGeneris), a sweet but very absent-minded fish who tags along with Marlin to provide comedy relief for the story.
     There is also a very good side story involving Nemo and a group of fish in a tank as they bond and try to formulate the grand escape to freedom and return Nemo to his father.       What follows is a very funny and charming story as the two fish encounter everything from sharks in a 12 Step program trying to change their image to a migration of surfer dude turtles. Of course there are dangers along the way and parents should be cautioned that some scenes did cause tears from some of the very young viewers in the screener that I attended.
     While the plot is not the most complex story in the world, it is more than appropriate for the target audience of the film and there are more than enough laughs and smiles in the film to keep even the most jaded adult tuned in. The computer artistry is amazing as it is awash in motion, textures, and colors without being to frantic and providing an array of amazing visuals. I was very impressed at how each creature had detailed facial expressions that carried their emotions without having to rely heavily on the dialogue to convey feelings. In summary, `Finding Nemo' is an absolutely charming film and a true family classic that should not be missed. The film is easily the best work ever from Pixar, and that is saying something with their very impressive resume.

"OllieSuave-007","12 February 2015","This is a fun-filled Disney/Pixar movie that is pretty much on par with the Toy Story trilogy. It's a story about a clown fish named Marlin, who swims through the vast ocean in search of his son, Nemo, who was taken by a diver for a pet. Along the way, he meets a blue tang fish with short term memory loss named Dory, who joins him in the search. What follows is an incredible adventure full of dodging sharks, riding with turtles, swimming past jellyfish and trying to go through other obstacles to search for Nemo, while he himself tries to deal with life being somebody's pet.Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich did a great job in directing this movie, grasping the audience's attention from the start with a dramatic intro, followed by one adventurous scene after the other, making the plot very fast-paced and exciting. The story quickly identifies the issue of Nemo being pretty rebellious and the issue of worrying about his father's fear of the vast open sea. The tide turns within the story as Nemo is fished out of water and Marlin ends up taking the sea on to find him. All these plot elements and unpredictable moments make this an edge-of-the-ride film from start to finish.The entire voice cast did a great job in their respective roles, making the characters very lovable. Ellen DeGeneres did a hilarious and upbeat job in voicing Dory (you could see Ellen's humorous personality in the fish) and Willem Dafoe did a mysterious yet caring portrayal in voicing Gill, who tries to keep a lookout for Nemo. I especially enjoyed seeing the every day human traits and dialog being acted out in these sea creatures, making the movie that much funnier. In addition, the music score from Thomas Newman is quite spirited and the animation team did a spectacular job in capturing the splendor of the sea.I thought, though, the story goes too fast at times, leaving little room for the audience to generate sympathy during the more tense and solemn moments, and I thought some of the characters acted a little too excited. But overall, it's a very fun and heartwarming Disney tale that is great for the entire family! Grade A-","

"CinemaClown","7 October 2013","Marking the biggest leap for Pixar Animation Studios since their groundbreaking debut with Toy Story in 1995, Finding Nemo brings a whole new level of maturity in Pixar's method of storytelling, a new surge in its humour, creativity & imagination, and another elevation in its already unparalleled animation to succeed not only as one of the best films of its genre but is also exceptional enough to be regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.Finding Nemo tells the story of Marlin; a clownfish residing in the Great Barrier Reef who's very overprotective of his son, Nemo. When Nemo is captured by scuba divers & taken to Sydney, Marlin sets out on a journey throughout the ocean to find his son, is joined by Dory; an optimistic blue tang suffering from short-term memory loss, encounters many more dangers & adventures and in the process, learns to appreciate life a lot more than ever before.Directed by Andrew Stanton, Finding Nemo is drop-dead gorgeous from the first frame to the last, is crafted with immense care, passion & love, has a surprising level of depth in its story, is filled with characters that are rich, charismatic & colourful, captures ocean life unlike ever before in cinema history, brims with clever use of humour, expertly balances its storytelling aspects with jaw-dropping animation and has something in store for viewers of all ages.It's pretty evident from its presentation that Pixar's production design team did a massive amount of research before animating it on the film canvas, the camera-work is jubilantly carried out & fills the screen with vivid colours. Editing makes sure every single scene plays a relevant role in pushing its story forward & steadily paces its 100 minutes of runtime while Thomas Newman's score makes the whole experience all the more touching, mesmerising & emotionally resonant.The level of precision, sharpness & detailing in its animation is no short of an achievement, every single character is skilfully drawn & rendered whether it's the shark, whale, turtles or jellyfish, and is perfectly voiced by its terrific voice cast. And while everyone shines in their given roles, it's Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who turns out to be the show-stealer for she is without a doubt one of the most optimistic characters to surface on the silver screen.On an overall scale, Finding Nemo is love at first sight. It's a stunning, bewitching, magical, emotionally rich & truly unforgettable cinema that has a lot to say about parenting, friendship, trust & determination and sets a higher benchmark for its genre. One of Pixar's biggest home-runs on critical, commercial & emotional scale, Finding Nemo is a spellbinding underwater adventure that you'll want to experience again n again. 'Sea' it to believe it.","

"lisafordeay","16 April 2014","Finding Nemo is a Pixar animated movie about a clown fish named Merlin who is an overprotective parent to Nemo,as his wife died and Merlin found Nemo's egg and from that day Merlin is afraid to let go of his son. A few years later Nemo is all grown up(kind of) and goes to school,but when he got mad at his father who wouldn't leave him alone,Nemo gets taken by a scuba diver and is taken to Sydney Australia(where the movie is set) and is now living at the aquarium at the dentist clinic,where the dentist's daughter wants Nemo!!!.So Nemo tries to find a way out thanks to some fish(one led by Spiderman star Willem Defoe,and Brad Garrett who was the voice of Hook Hand Thug in Tangled),while Nemo's dad travels all over the sea to search for his son,alongside a forgetful fish named Dory(voiced by Ellen De Generes)who helps him find his son again. They later meet a bunch of tortoises who help Nemos dad find Nemo again. But will Merlin ever see his son alive ever again,and can Nemo escape the aquarium at the dentist clinic to be reunited with his father?Bottom line I have seen this movie before and to be quite honest I really enjoyed this movie. The animation is fantastic,the story is very touching and will lift your spirits,the voice cast is great,especially the guy who voices Merlin(who I think starred in The In Laws with Micheal Douglas,Albert Finney yeah him)and as for the rest of the film well its actually really good. My favourite Pixar movie would have to be Toy Story but this would probably in my list too somewhere.Overall its a thrill to watch and I recommend it to those who love underwater adventure movies. I have nothing wrong to say about it so i'll give it a 9 out 10.Cowabunga dude","

"Jeremy_Urquhart","8 April 2022","This is absolutely one of Pixar's best films. Having rewatched the four films they released prior to this previously,I can also say that this is their first film with 100% flawlessly aged animation. There's a few janky moments in their earlier stuff, and maybe a few nitpicks when it comes to the animation in Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc, but Finding Nemo looks great from start to finish, with amazing water effects, great character animation, and tons of variety in all the environments.The characters are all fun and almost every single scene is memorable. I also love the music, and the way its emotional impact kind of sneaks up on you. As great and as sad as the most moving scenes in Toy Story 2 and Up are (to take two examples), Finding Nemo feels a little more subtle in how moving it is. After the opening scene, it doesn't really hit until the end, and that sense of making an audience feel something without being direct/obvious about it is something Pixar doesn't do a lot (I'd say they kind of do it in Wall-E too, which funnily enough has the same director as Finding Nemo).After Toy Story 2, this is my favourite of Pixar's first five films, and I think it's close to perfect, even now, some 20 years after release. A near masterpiece, and it remains just as funny, fun, imaginative, and moving as it was back in 2003.","

"zkonedog","7 March 2017","There have always been three reasons why these animated Pixar films have appealed to us all so much. First, of course, is the fact that they are just plain so much fun. Second, is that they have a message that tugs on the heartstrings of young and old. Finally, they are full of humor for both the target children and the adults watching with them. ""Finding Nemo"" is no exception to any of those categories.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees young clownfish Nemo (Alexander Gould) accidentally become separated from his over-protective father Marlin (Albert Brooks). As Nemo has his own adventures in a tropical fish tank owned by a dentist, Marlin begins his quest to rescue his young son, along the way running into the memory-challenged Dory (Ellen Degeneres) who ultimately shows him a new perspective on life.Visually, ""Finding Nemo"" is stunning. Watching it on blu-ray is truly a visual treat, with the underwater landscapes and their various colors making this effort perhaps the best-looking Pixar flick ever.In terms of humor, ""Nemo"" has enough moments that will have the kids giggling as well as the adults chuckling. It can be a very serious movie at times, but it never forgets to mix a healthy dose of fun into the proceedings.The main plot line--Marlin looking for Nemo--turns out to be quite an emotional punchline, as Marlin slowly begins to discover the things he needs to do different if/when he finds his son.Overall, ""Finding Nemo"" deserves a place towards the highest ranking of Pixar endeavors. Though nothing may ever quite top ""Toy Story"", ""Nemo"" belongs on that ""1-B"" slot right along with ""WALL-E"" and ""Up"".","

"The-Sarkologist","30 January 2017","Well, after reading a summary of this film that actually makes it sound really messed up, a part of me really wanted to see it. Mind you, I'm not actually surprised that somebody has come up with such a summary for Finding Nemo because it is a Disney production, and Disney is known for turning some rather dubious films, and stories, into movies that are actually quite suitable for kids – take Cinderella for example, or Hercules (he's certainly not one of those people that a respectable woman would bring home to meet her parents). However, unless you actually read this interpretation of the film you probably wouldn't realise how messed up it sounds.Anyway, Finding Nemo is about how a man's wife and family are murdered by a serial killer, and then whose only son, who happens to be disabled, is kidnapped. So the man, with the help of a friend who happens to suffer from an intellectual disability, must track down the kidnappers and free his son. Oh, I probably should also mention that the last words that were said to him were words of hate due to the man's over protective nature.Okay, while it might not be obvious at first, as I have mentioned, that explanation of the film does actually make sense, and in a way it is quite good because it doesn't paint the world as being a nice and happy place full of nice and healthy people. In fact, with two of the main characters having serious disabilities, and overcoming those disabilities, does have a lot to teach children. In a way, one shouldn't let their disabilities get them down, but rather see them as a defining characteristic. However, this film also has a message for parents, and that is that sooner or later we are going to have to let our children go.To a parent (and I don't speak on experience here since I have never had children, nor have I ever been married), losing one's children can be heart wrenching. In fact even losing a single child is heart wrenching, to the point that marriages have been destroyed over the death of a child. In a way a child is our progeny, that which we leave for the world, that which becomes our legacy. As such I can understand why parents would get over protective, but the problem is that when we are over protective of our children, our children don't actually know how to survive in the real world. In a way I am even wondering whether the 'softness' of our society has come about through over protectiveness, where parent-teacher nights go from being a dread for the kid to being dreadful for the teacher. In a way society has moved from a point where a child's failure has not come about due to the child failing to study, but rather through the teacher's failure to give the student good grades.There were a couple of other things I loved about this film, in particular the seagulls. I have to admit that they really portrayed seagulls very, very well – being incredibly possessive and incredibly single minded. Where as pretty much all of the other animals we encounter come across as intelligent (particularly the sharks who are attempting to become vegetarian) the seagulls can only say one thing 'mine'. In a way they are the most animalistic of the animals, existing only to eat, and fighting amongst themselves for every scrap of food. Living so close to the ocean I have a lot of experience with seagulls, and there is a reason that they are called flying rats – because they are.While I have to admit that I have grown out of children's movies somewhat, some of them are actually quite fun, and Finding Nemo was definitely one of them. Mind you, I still can't get it out of my mind that I have actually seen this film before, namely because there is so much about it that is familiar.","

"fernandoschiavi","23 May 2021","Apparently, Pixar wizards love challenges: after the Toy Story and Toy Story 2 dolls, the Insect Life ants and the Monsters SA creatures (including the extremely difficult task of animating Sulley's millions of hairs), the artists from the company led by John Lasseter decided to set their new work in one of the most complicated environments in digital animation: water. The result, fortunately, is a colossal technical victory: in addition to being totally credible, the ocean seen in Finding Nemo offers Pixar artists the opportunity to prove (once again) their visual accuracy, since the extremely complicated underwater photography is beautiful, with amazing lighting effects.When Finding Nemo begins, we are introduced to the happy couple of clown fishes formed by Marlin and Coral, who have just moved, alongside their hundreds of roe, to an anemone with a 'panoramic' view of the (bottom of) the ocean. Unfortunately, a predator's attack results in the death of practically all of Marlin's family, leaving him a widower and with little Nemo to raise - something that turns him into an overprotective father. Thus, it is with great terror that, one day, the poor fish sees his son being caught by fishermen and taken to an aquarium. Determined to rescue Nemo, Marlin embarks on a risky journey in search of the goldfish, being helped by the friendly Dory - who, unfortunately, has a very serious memory problem.As it has already become standard in Pixar's productions, Finding Nemo immerses the viewer (pardoning the pun) in a multicolored and nuanced universe: inhabited by an infinity of cute creatures (and others not so much), the ocean seen here has their own versions of road signs, highways and even support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous. Filling every inch of the screen with details that reveal admirable preciousness, the team of animators pays particular attention to the elaboration of their characters' facial expressions, transforming them into fun and charismatic figures - notice, for example, the changes in the face of the turtle Crush while you talk to Marlin and also observe the look of pride that appears on Nemo's face when he hears a certain news about his father. At times like these, the expressiveness of the characters is such that the dialogues become even dispensable.Like all good animation, Finding Nemo presents us with a tale in which family and friendship relationships are the safe haven of its main characters. But this question, which can be considered (in fact it is) cliché, is treated in such a beautiful, fun and extremely intelligent way that one cannot fail to notice the numerous parallels with the reality of the spectators, whether children or adults. This is where the film differentiates itself from the others and shows its maturity. The work is a pearl from Pixar that focuses precisely on the concept of family and how much we are willing to risk when fighting for our family. It is a sweet tale, full of adventure, suspense and a genius humor that leaves us absolutely amazed. It is not just a movie for children, on the contrary. Morality is very adult and the teachings that come from the film illustrate that we should never judge a ""book by its cover"" or give up on those that are most important to us. Something that, in adults, we value much more than at a young age.In addition, Finding Nemo also includes some curiously complex subtexts: the title character's 'fin of luck', for example, is a clear reference to the physically challenged - and brings a beautiful message about the way they face the obstacles that arise in their lives. No less complex is the relationship between Marlin and his son - something that is summed up in a very sensitive way by Dory: 'If you insist on protecting him in this way, nothing will happen to him. On the other hand, nothing is going to happen to him'. And while Pixar's previous work relied on his dramatic moments, none of them ever reached the intensity of the scene in which Marlin swims across the ocean screaming, desperately, 'My son! My son! '.Even though Finding Nemo is an animation film mostly centered on a banal theme, it is the way it combines the elements by providing an excellent evening for the family, which makes it so genuine and so adorable. It is a tale about challenges, about loss, abandonment and above all about reunion, love and companionship. The characters are striking, with strong human traits, which give children a perspective on how they will become when they are adults, recognizing the unconditional value that the family has for all of us.Getting the audience to see themselves in these little fish was the director's first step. The second was to create a world in which the audience could dive, achieving this through an art direction that lives up to the spectacular double between human creativity and the biological diversity of the ocean. What also makes ""Nemo"" timeless is director Andrew Stanton's talent for combining magnificent visuals and exotic worlds with extremely human themes. The fights between Marlin and Nemo can occur anywhere and the public can easily identify with the positions taken by both characters. In this, neither of them sounds, at any time, unsympathetic, but flawed as either. However, unlike, for example, Bryan Mills in the first ""Relentless Quest"", our protagonist is an absolutely ordinary father, not the king of the seven seas or even a heroic action animal. Meanwhile, Nemo experiences his own dilemmas and difficulties at the aquarium, with David Ian Salter's montage skillfully switching between the two narrative lines.On the other hand, Finding Nemo cannot escape its road movie structure (or should I say 'ocean movie'?) And, unfortunately, allows that to make it episodic and irregular. Developing parallel actions (Marlin's search and Nemo's escape attempt), the film jumps from one narrative to another always in a similar way, abusing, for example, the fade-outs (screen blackouts) that illustrate the characters' fainting. As a result, the rhythm of the story cannot be as constant as that of most of Pixar's previous work.As for the pace and dramatic appeal, we shouldn't worry: for every dramatic incident seen in Finding Nemo there are countless other comic reliefs to balance things out: in addition to the jokes involving Dory's memory, the film's script features very inspiring scenes involving three sharks who struggle to improve the public image of the species; a school with a talent for imitation; a group of 'surfing' turtles; and, of course, curious jokes throughout the final credits. The production also includes several hilarious references to works by Hitchcock (the little girl Darla, who could be considered a female version of Sid from Toy Story, is always accompanied by the theme of Psychosis) and adventures such as Mission: Impossible (the plan Gil's escape route is tragically funny).Navigating an ocean of creative possibilities, ""Finding Nemo"" features incredible catchphrases (""keep swimming"", ""worm u-ha-ha""), hilarious situations (vegetarian sharks and hippy turtles) and a range of memorable fish (the aquarium dentist has one of the best Pixar groups). And although the journey in search of the young clownfish is the main adornment of the narrative, it is in Dory that we find the most fun portion of the story. Dory literally has a fish memory. He forgets what he is going to say or do with frightening frequency. And, despite the comic aspect, it is when she teaches us to speak ""whale"" that brings us to tears from laughing so much. It is amazing how both the North American version and the Portuguese version manage to highlight the inevitable perfection of the character. Both Ellen DeGeneres and Rita Blanco are adept at bringing this fish so adorably comical. Dory's success was so acclaimed by critics and fans that she was entitled to her own feature film.The interesting thing is also how Nemo and Merlin's trajectory grows, far from each other, makes both grow. In his search for Nemo, Marlin ends up meeting different groups of sea animals that show him how to be more open, not only towards his son, but also towards new friends. The clownfish, in fact, has nothing funny (one of the big draws in the film), because with the trauma of the loss he ended up totally reclusive. Situation begins to change as he enjoys the presence of the clumsy Dory (a spectacular dubbing work by Ellen DeGeneres, as good as what Robin Williams did for the Lamp Genie in Aladdin, 1992), enhanced when Marlin almost loses his friend burned by a gigantic group of jellyfish.Everyone knows the end of the story, even if they haven't seen the movie. What counts here is not the outcome (which, although not original, can be treated with dignity), but the trajectory and evolution of its characters. Even if Dory says at any time, ""Nemo? Cool name!"", Finding Nemo is not just above average fun, but a subtle way of thinking about the complexity of educating a child and, at the same time, treating this growth in a light way. With a simple, well-intentioned humor, affectionate animation and delicious characters, Finding Nemo is one of the best productions to date at Pixar. A timeless animated classic with a sweet message and its own vision of the concept of family and how much it means to us. It is a spiral of unlimited fun, a mind-blowing adventure, and an ode to everyone who does not give up looking for the most important aspect of life: the love of the family.","

But the most I liked was the real special effects and the very clear animation that makes very believable that these fishes are real.

"soymilk","26 February 2004","This is a good film but overrated. There, I said it.This was just too reminiscent of when 'Shrek' first hit the screens, in 2001  the 3D animation everyone was going gaga over, repeatedly hailing as the greatest animated movie ever, and yet didn't really impress me all that much. Seemingly, I was the only person on the planet to feel that way. I didn't really 'get' 'Shrek', don't especially 'get' it even now, and for some reason I didn't quite manage to 'get' 'Finding Nemo' either, the next 3D film to get the 'greatest animated movie' ever proclamation, in spite of the fact that I was really, really determined to kick off my socks and enjoy this one. Well, it's cute and it's colourful, and the idea of a father clownfish (named Marlin) trekking the ocean to be reunited with his missing son (named, oddly enough, Nemo) is a nice one for sure, but there was just something about it which left me feeling strangely unsatisfied. All in all it's a worthy venture for the Pixar cabinet, visually gorgeous and with a handful of effective moments, but seriously, they have done better.The main problem comes in the story structure, which is too rambling and disjointed to do it for me. I actually agree with another viewer who commented that it felt more like that of a multi-levelled video game than a movie. All it really involves is Marlin swimming along and avoiding getting chomped by dangerous sea-dwelling predator after sea-dwelling predator. We meet plenty of interesting characters along the way, but the nature of the story means that they're removed from the action within minutes. For example, the trio of sinister but slow-witted sharks struggling to go veggie, who have a lot less screen time than the promotional posters and trailers might imply and are never given the chance to amount to much more than a few time-filling wisecracks. Nigel the pelican, in spite of Geoffrey Rush's spunky voicing, is a mostly bland character whose motives for befriending and assisting the fish are left conveniently unspoken (after all, naturally he's another sea-dwelling predator himself), and I found the surfer turtles just a tad annoying (particularly the young ones  call me heartless, but bleh!).Another pretty nagging drawback is that neither protagonist, be it Marlin or Nemo, is nearly as sympathetic as past Pixar creations like Woody or Sulley. Marlin is too whiny to be truly likable, and Nemo doesn't really get the great deal of development you'd usually expect in a title character. The script is notably also less sharp than previous Pixar instalments. There was one scene in the dentist's waiting room which had me in stitches, but that was about it. It's mostly just movie in-jokes for most of the time. While in 'Toy Story' the various nods to other movies were little more than subtle extras for the sharp-eyed viewer to enjoy alongside a script brimming with plenty of witty gags of its own, they're pretty much integral to this screenplay. 'Finding Nemo' suffers from the same 'self-indulgent movie spoof' syndrome that you can find in most 3D animation from the Dreamworks stable, with a slew of constant parodies (that most of us have already seen at some point in 'the Simpsons') substituting for real humour. Usually, Pixar are always one step ahead of their rivals in this respect, but this time round even they were unable to resist succumbing to it.There are certain aspects of 'Finding Nemo' that I liked. For example, Dory, the regal blue tang who trails Marlin insistently on his travels  technically she's as 2D as everyone else in this flick, her whole character consisting of little more than the one-joke comedy gimmick that she suffers from short term memory loss and can never remember quite what she's doing. There's so much potential here to be annoying, but somehow she manages to pull through and, against the odds, prove a surprisingly charming character throughout. Perhaps it comes down to Ellen DeGenere's brilliant voice work. Also, I like it that the standard comic relief sidekick can finally be female, and that Marlin and Dory manage to maintain an entirely platonic relationship throughout (no token love interests here).But the most interesting character by far is William Dafoe's hard-bitten Moorish idol, Gill  he's given some hints of a personal history, yet it goes curiously understated throughout. Many of the 'Tank Gang' sequences seem pretty out of place (what does the welcome ritual have to add to the story, other than establishing the existence of that bubble volcano?), but nonetheless, some of the dialogue exchanged between Gill and Nemo is quite nice and add a sprinkling of depth to a film which I otherwise found to be just a little toohollow?Plus, the sight of an angler fish caught up in a pair of diving goggles is unexpectedly alluring - still, the poor, poor creature ;)'Finding Nemo' isn't a bad film by any means. In fact, it's pretty darn good. But Pixar have made other movies which, ironically, could blow this clean out of the water. In short, it's sweet and pleasant but  there's that word again - overrated.Grade: B","

"EijnarAmadeus","6 April 2004","Pixar Studios is one of the world's most exciting and cool film studios. They deliver every single time for the whole family; fun, dramatic, brilliance, entertainment, moral...everything! Before this instalment Pixar has given us TOY STORY 1/2, A BUG'S LIFE and MONSTERS INC. that's all extremely good films! This, last one, FINDING NEMO is just as jolly good!
We follow Marlin, a clown-fish that's on a desperat look for his only child, Nemo, that as said before is the only survivor after their family was brutally attacked by a barracuda and almost everybody were eaten. Marlin hooks up with another fish that shows herself to have extremely bad memory and forgets thing almost before she's get to know them! Now, these two goes on the search of Nemo, who's lost in the big blue ocean, where there are sharks, bombs, whales, birds and much more!The story is this time probably the best detail, off course together with the humour that is also brilliant fun! It is packed with funny scenes and the animation is getting more and more stunning, the dialogs are brilliant, everything works as good as it gets! Dozens of genius characters are packed into this story. It is a very choosy movie and it keeps up it's entertainment in a very fine way, the only thing that's something to put anything on is the end, that's really nothing. But the rest of the movie is pure entertainment and is very, very nice watching! FINDING NEMO's got entire scenes. Like the one with the three sharks that has decided to form a club where they have to promise that they shall not eat other fishes, cause that's cannibalism. Either it's small characters or big, they're all over the place! You laugh a lot, and if it isn't funny, it's just so entertaining or nice made that you can't keep your eyes off the screen. As the movie goes by you feel a small piece of boring in the middle, but FINDING NEMO fixes it with smacking some more characters and keeping the tempo up and keeping the paralell - story interesting with Nemo actually being caught in a aquarium together with other fishes.STARS: 5/5","

"acedj","13 December 2019","Long have I loved this movie. This is the story of a lovable, yet over protective clown fish and his son, Marlon and Nemo respectively. On the first day of school, Nemo is taken off the reef by a dentist from Sydney. Marlon sets out to rescue his son. On the way he quite literally runs into a Blue Dart named Dory. Dory has a disorder where she can not retain short term memories. The two set out together and hilarity ensues. This is a Disney owned movie so of course there are some touching moments as well as a happy ending, but the substance of the movie is phenomenal. The detail the animators put into it is fantastic. They also manage to squeeze in some Easter eggs, and not all of them are Pixar/Disney related. The great white shark is named Bruce, which was the nickname given to the animatronic shark in Jaws. To me there is no better film in the realm of animation out there, before or after.","

I've first seen it as a kid in 2003, and I instantly got obsessed with it and I've watched it numerous times.Finding Nemo is about a clownfish named Marlin and his son Nemo living in the ocean. Nemo is then captured by us humans, and Marlin is desperate to find his son, who is ""imprisoned"" in an aquarium in a dental clinic in Australia.The characters are perfectly voiced by Albert Brooks and Alexander Gould. Ellen is also charming as the voice of the hilarious Blue Hippo Tang with short-term memory loss named Dory. The movie is animated beautifully with a moving soundtrack composed by Thomas Newman.Finding Nemo is an unforgettable film that will still capture the hearts of many in the years to come.","

"jboothmillard","14 July 2005","The very first computer animated film made, and by Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar was Toy Story, and since then we've had A Big's Life, Dinosaur, Toy Story 2 and Monsters, Inc. This was one of the most successful Disney films at the cinema to date. It is the underwater story of a young clown fish named Nemo (Alexander Gould) taken by divers and put into a tank. The idea is obviously his Dad, Marlin (Albert Brooks), and new friend Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss, are ""finding"" him. Meanwhile, Nemo along with new friends including fishes Gill (Willem Dafoe), Bloat (Brad Garrett), Peach (Allison Janney), Gurgle (Austin Pendleton), Bubbles (Stephen Root), Deb/Flo (Vicki Lewis), Jacques (Joe Ranft) and pelican Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) are trying to escape. Along the journey Marland and Dory encounter three sharks, including Bruce (Barry Humphries, aka Dame Edna Everage) (named after the rubber Shark in the Jaws series), stinging jellyfish, turtles in a current tunnel, including ""dude"" Crush (Andrew Stanton) and much more, but he finds him eventually, and everything's fine. Also starring Big's Elizabeth Perkins as Coral, Nicholas Bird as Squirt, Bob Peterson as Mr. Ray, Eric Bana as Anchor, and Toy Story's John Ratzenberger as Fish School. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and it was nominated for Best Music, Original Score for Thomas Newman, Best Sound Editing, and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. It was number 13 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 56 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!","

"Flagrant-Baronessa","18 July 2006","Finding Nemo can be seen as the bridge between Pixar Studios and Walt Disney Studios. It is the result of filmmakers and crew meeting halfway on this bridge and including aspects from both production companies and making it work. Finding Nemo brings some of the adult humour of Pixar (as seen in Ice Age, Monsters inc, etc) and combines it with the morals and lessons that Disney wants to teach (as seen inuh.. every Disney film).While it would be more than OK with me to simply omit the latter in animated features to leave room for comedy and nice visuals, I see at least some faint need for moral statements as films like this primarily cater to children. These kinds of morals and values lessons are thankfully kept to a minimum in Finding Nemo - but they are present and they do drag the film down on occasion.Finding Nemo tells the story of a widowed clownfish named Marlin who frequently goes overboard trying to protect his only living son, Nemo, from the dangers and non-dangers of the ocean world. One day, Nemo is captured by a scuba diver and Marlin, devastated, is left to face his own fears to go and find Nemo.Finding Nemo is an ocean ride with superb animations of sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans. The film parodies human behavior by creating an ocean world that greatly reflects our own (crayfish mowing their lawns, sting-rays as teachers). At the same time it brings some of nature in. I loved the sea gulls more than anything because they are seen in such great contrast to Marlin who is so human; he is complex, thinking and refined. The gulls are simply ""rat with wings"" in this film and are portrayed as such. Totally brainless creatures but providers of the greatest comedy in Finding Nemo. So it is not only Disney and Pixar meeting halfway, but nature and human behavior meeting halfway too.This is probably the closest (aside from maybe The Emperor's New Groove) Disney has come to making an adult-humoured animated film - and they needed Pixar to do it. 7/10","

Kids probably will really enjoy it but for teens and adults I dunno it might be a mixed bag, It was good that I saw the movie and I enjoyed it but FOR ME it was nothing too crazy or special. And the first time I saw this film was when I was 6-7 so I ain't biased or anything it's more of a nostalgia feeling for me.Solid story filled with character exposition and adventure and had a lot of positive messages to it. There were a ton of characters actually most of them being side characters but somehow they manage to make them interesting and unique. The dynamic between father and son, Dory the short term memory fish, and the short screentime for the turtules were hilarious. The visuals were great considering the time it came out in. The animal's design, the habitats, etc. The music really matched with the movie and had great voice acting.Overall an enjoyable film.Memorable: So so (Nostalgia) Rewatchable: Maybe..","

"KineticSeoul","8 December 2012","I remember the first time I saw this Pixar movie when it first came out when I was in elementary school. I thought it was alright back then but nothing special. And didn't have the impact on me during my childhood like the movie ""Lion King"" or the first ""Toy Story"" did. Didn't think it was a bad film back then but wasn't enthusiastic about it to the point I wanted to see it a second time. Now seeing it again as an adult in 3D my opinions about this movie is still about the same but I appreciate it a bit more. So the story is about a Clown fish that loses his only son and he goes across the ocean with a friend fish named Dory played by Ellen DeGeneres. Who did a amazing job with her role, in fact her character stood out the most in the whole movie. And through the journey it shows what Nemo is going through after being captured by the humans but mostly shows Nemo's dad's journey with clever fish scenarios thrown in different areas. And the clever scenarios mixed in with different fishes is what drives this movie. Overall it was a alright movie and you can tell quite a bit of effort has been thrown into this animated flick. But it didn't really have that impact to make it all that memorable.6.9/10","

"Aly200","13 February 2017","Pixar has been on a consistent roll of success since their first animated feature ""Toy Story"". With their beloved oceanic tale of a clown-fish father looking for his kidnapped son, Pixar struck gold with their audiences all over the globe. The animation juggernaut is well known for creating relatable characters and the fishy residents of Sydney, Australia, and the Great Barrier Reef are no different. Many parents can relate to the worrisome nature of clown-fish Marlin, a father who has grown far too overprotective of his son (the titular Nemo) after a tragedy takes away his family except for his lone son, and children can relate to Nemo wanting to rebel and care for himself, but is stifled by Marlin's constant hovering, as well as Nemo's fear when he first arrives in the tank at the dentist's office. And then there can those of us who are forgetful can see ourselves in the lovably space-case Dory, but Dory also is loyal, cheerful and kindhearted despite her lapses in memory.The voice casting in the film is pitch perfect. Forming the film's familial bond are comedic-dramatic actor Albert Brooks as the high-strung Marlin, hilariously overzealous while maintaining a serious tone in appropriate scenes, and young actor Alexander Gould brings a wonderful naivety yet youthful boldness to Nemo, maturing well through the film as he goes from an impulsive child to a smarter and brave kid who will pull his weight. The film's first set of comedic relief is the hilariously diverse tank gang who reside in an Austrailian dentist's fish tank where Nemo ends up and needs to escape from. With memorable characters like the bubble-obsessed yellow tang Bubbles (voiced by 'NewRadio' alumni Stephen Root), French cleaner shrimp Jacques (voiced with a spot-on faux accent by the late Joe Ranft), the motherly and tank gang watchdog starfish Peach (voice of Allison Janney of 'Juno' and the sitcom 'Mom' fame), kindhearted and prone to random bloating flair-ups blow-fish Bloat (voiced by Brad Garrett), neurotic royal gamma Gurgle (voiced to perfection by Austin Pendleton) and the ditzy but sweet Deb (voived by another 'NewsRadio' alumni Vicki Lewis) who thinks her reflection in the tank's glass is her twin sister. Leading the ragtag group that Nemo finds himself surrounded by is the grizzled and father figure-like butterfly fish Gill (voiced perfectly by Willem Dafoe, whose iconic low vocal tones are utilized to perfection), the tank leader who is more than determined to escape the confines of the office and glass prison. However the film's scene-stealing, or should it be said movie-stealing, character is the lovably forgetful Dory voiced to comedic brilliance by talk show host and comedienne Ellen DeGeneres. Dory is initially a massive pain in the neck for Marlin as her memory lapses test the clown-fish's patience, but her devoted and helpful nature soon grow on the stingy Marlin. The film's comic relief from the drama of the situation that Marlin finds himself in, Dory is always an optimist who sees the bright side of a problem. Her funniest moment would arguably be Dory's whale-talking after she and Marlin have disembarked the sea turtle driven EAC (East Australian Current). DeGeneres goes hilariously over the top as she makes various oddball sounds that sometimes sound like whale intonations but other times are just random guttural or bizarre shouts that will split sides and force tears of laughter.Lush animations based on actual sketches of the Great Barrier Reef and its oceanic specimens as well the surrounding Sydney neighborhood are breathtaking and put us right in the environments the characters live in. A wonderful family film that will make you laugh, cry and hug your relatives even tighter.","

"sandnair87","31 March 2015","Pixar's animation wonder Finding Nemo, is a shimmery, velvety undersea coming-of-age story which is aglow with translucent sea flora and gleaming, iridescent creatures. Australia's Great Barrier Reef provides a stunning starting point for this aquatic parable. Nemo (Alexander Gould) is a spunky little clown-fish with a slight disability - a foreshortened front fin. Nemo's single father, Marlin (Albert Brooks) is a dry, wry clown-fish with an excess of anxiety (He is also a clown who can't tell a joke, though he keeps trying to do so quite hilariously). Despite Marlin's suffocating attention, his small fry is scooped up by a scuba diving dentist and gets separated from his father. Determined not to lose his son, Marlin begins a long, arduous albeit seemingly hopeless rescue mission across the sea and soon bumps into an overly exuberant, sweetly scatterbrained regal blue tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). They search for Nemo together in the face of stinging jellyfish, exploding mines, noxious sharks and other irritable flounders. In the meantime, Nemo makes some very good friends in the dentist's aquarium, including a tiger fish (Willem Dafoe) who helps him plan an escape. From then on, it's a relentless journey of visual excitement and wonder, as the distraught father sets off to rescue his offspring and Nemo finds ways to escape from the aquarium. As is mandatory for a family film, there are plenty of life lessons for kids to learn, but they come sugar-coated with humor and fun. Meanwhile, a more adult undercurrent offers grown-up laughs, and there's even some old-fashioned tear-jerking to complete the emotional roller-coaster ride.Andrew Stanton plays the viewer like a fiddle, and it's a privilege to be played. Its animation is truly stunning, awash (pun intended) in a dazzling array of colors and creating the impression of a living, breathing sea. Every moment is magnificently orchestrated to tease a response from us - anything from awe to aw-shucks. Yes, it's a visual feast, but more importantly it's an epic journey filled with adventure and discovery that encompasses the grandest sweep of the ocean's vastness and the tiniest longing of the heart. While preserving the characters' intrinsic ""fishy-ness"", the silver- tongued voice cast offers great supplementary texture to a marvelous sensory experience. While Brooks is amusing as the ever fretful Marlin, it is DeGeneres who gives a bravura comic performance as the guileless but whacked-out Dory. Ceaselessly forgetful, her endearing Dory makes a difficult traveling companion but a scintillating friend – Dory is a complete hoot.Instead of rising to a challenge, Finding Nemo plunges into it and comes up a winner. All in all, a buoyant adventure that manages to evoke the quicksilver trait of the ocean without necessarily feeling 'wet'!","

"98nurdinm-1","4 March 2005","""Finding Nemo"" is, quite simply, one of the most beautiful films you are ever likely to see. Next time you watch it, try this for an idea. Press your mute button and watch it without sound for a while, particularly the scene where Mr.Ray (Bob Peterson) takes all the little fish, including Nemo (Alexander Gould), through the coral reef towards the infamous drop off. It's still as enjoyable!The film starts off quite darkly, which is odd considering the nature of the rest of the film - quite light-hearted. It is, however, an essential part of the story, explaining how the fear of Marlin (Albert Brooks) towards the ocean came about, and also as a result the over-protectiveness he has over his son, Nemo.The storyline itself is pretty simple: Nemo gets captured by a scuba-diving dentist, Marlin swims off to rescue him. What helps the story is the many different and fantastic characters that he meets along the way to ""P Sherman, 42 Wallabe Way, Sydney"". This is of course where he meets the fantastic Dory (played here brilliantly by Ellen DeGeneres). Dory is quite possibly one of the funniest characters in a Pixar movie EVER. Her short-term memory loss is an inspired comedic characteristic that results in some great lines. For example:""It (the memory problem) runs in my family. At least I think it does. Hmm. Where are they? Can I help you?""There are other good characters in this story, though. there are the three friendly sharks, whose motto is ""Fish are friends, not food"". This proves to be their undoing, particularly Bruce's (Barry Humphries - you know, Dame Edna Everage?), resulting in a good chase sequence through a sunken submarine and mine field. We have the school of fish who enjoy making exciting 3d moving pictures (voiced singularly by John Ratzenberger, Pixar's lucky mascot). And of course you cannot forget the ""Righteous! Righteous!"" sea turtles.Nemo meets interesting characters in the dentist's aquarium as well, including Gill (Willhelm Daefoe), who is constantly trying to get back into the ocean from whence he came. The rest are all pretty much bonkers - a cleanliness obsessed fish, a smelly blowfish, and a schizophrenic fish whose ""sister"", Flo, appears every time she looks through the glass of the aquarium.Finally we have the non-swimming characters. The dentist is probably responsible for the scene where more people became scared of them then Laurence Olivier's performance in ""Marathon Man"". His removal of the tooth of the ""Prime Minister"" is a great line that doesn't register first time around. This is probably because Nigel (Geforry Rush) has just crashed into the window. Very funny, and also a rather interestingly detailed knowledge of dentistry. Finally there is the movie's token ""villain"" of sorts - Darla, the dentist's niece, and now famous for been associated with the ""Psycho"" theme for young people.The movie is enjoyable every time you watch it. Throughout it we see the change in attitude towards the ocean in Marlin's behaviour and dialog, and Dory is always there beside him to provide yet another witty comment. (My girlfriend particularly likes the one about men asking for directions). It is also interesting to note that the final opponent to the success of this magnificent quest is humans themselves - in this case, fishermen. Just as in ""Bambi"" with the hunter and his mother - sniff - we are portrayed as heartless predators who are tampering with the beauty of nature. The fact that there is no dialogue or anything at all characteristic about the two fishermen makes the anonymity of them even more sinister. Overall, a brilliant movie. Watch it. Watch it again. It rocks! And remember, ""just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming...""9/10","

"C22Man","26 January 2016","Upon its release Finding Nemo solidified Pixar's position as the masters of animation. Just like they did with Toy Story, they'd crafted another fine film that was packed with everything for children and adults alike. On a technical level it is a masterclass, but it also provided a flowing story and a wide variety of characters that it was easy to get invested in. The story concerns overprotective clown fish Marlin whose son Nemo is taken by divers and he then purses them across the ocean. Along the way he meets a fish with short-term memory loss named Dory, sharks who have quit eating fish and a party of sea turtles. The film is effectively Marlin's journey and the colourful characters he meets who help him on his way, whilst Nemo tries to escape from the dentist fish-tank that he's ended up in. The story is straight-forward, but it is packed with so much emotion and excitement that it works to its advantage.The plot works like a road trip movie, we continually come across some colourful characters and we move on, except that there is a goal to achieve at the end of it all. What really makes the story work is that it addresses the connection between a father and son as well as knowing when it's time to let your son have his own adventures. This helps give the film a strong emotional centre not just for the turmoil that Marlin and Nemo have been put through, but also for Dory who simply wants someone to stand by her. Working with the plot is the animation which is truly superb, some of Pixar's most impressive. The ocean can look both overwhelmingly beautiful and incredibly dangerous, while they really capture the vastness of the deep seas pretty perfectly. The colour scheme is also wonderful, everything from the bright character designs to the coral reef simply leaps off the screen in a wash of beauty. With that said, it's the characters that truly make the film shine. Marlin is a typically anxious and neurotic father, but he's never a stick in the mud. He always appears to be very genuine and the journey he's willing to undertake for his son makes him so likable. Dory (a brilliant Ellen DeGeneres) makes a fantastic companion. You'd think her memory loss would get annoying but it's kept fresh thanks to her bright sense of humour and her almost childlike wonder at the world which is surprisingly endearing. Nemo is a pleasant innocent and his enthusiasm is charming, whilst the tank gang are all very enjoyable especially the mysterious Gill. I also enjoyed the tanks pelican friend Nigel and the three sharks that come together like an AA meeting to discuss giving up fish. Virtually all of these characters are different and memorable, having interesting designs and distinctive personalities.Another big positive is the score by Thomas Newman. It is simply lovely. It manages to convey the wide-eyed wonder of the underwater world beautifully thanks to the gorgeous melodies and soothing compositions. There's a real sense of adventure to it that brings you into the ocean world even more and it manages to heighten the excitement at times perfectly. The film also has many memorable lines and inspired comedic pieces. Many of these were so successful that they are now widely known in pop culture, whether it the seagulls constantly repeating ''Mine!'' or the tanks outrageous escape plan. To be fair to it, the film has very few weaknesses. The lack of an over-arching villain isn't an issue because of the type of film it is and both stories are given the perfect amount of screen time.It's fair to say that Finding Nemo is up there with Pixar's best films. It excels in pretty much every area that matters because it does what Pixar does best, which is craft a gripping adventure that is packed with plenty of comedy and emotion. This is a story that is very easy to be engaged in and the massive amount of characters all manage to get enough development. So when the two key areas are as strong as they are here then the film is already on the right road. Adding to that, the animation is some of Pixar's most expressive, the score is wonderful and the film is simply very memorable. There is just something so gripping and rather timeless about the films approach that makes it such a success.","

"mcfly-31","21 March 2004","Hmm, let's start with the death of a mother fish, an overprotective, wimpy father fish, jr. fish who says ""I hate you"", then have jr. kidnapped.  And all in the first five minutes!  Throw in big, scary fish and tons of melodramatic search and rescue action, and you've got...a ""kids"" movie?? They don't know any better, so this becomes their only alternative at the theater, which in turn makes it three hundred million dollars.  Usually these family films pack jokes for the older crowd that only they'd understand to keep them awake, along with the kiddie stuff.  Not here.  No fun of ""Toy Story"", with characters and imaginitive action passages to keep you engrossed.  Here we're saddled with a dull hero (voice of Brooks), a quickly annoying ""dumb funny"" fish (voice of DeGeneres) and a slew of not even recognizable celebrity voices who you'd be hard pressed to guess who it is.  The only, only, plus is the always reliable Pixar imagery, colorful and striking.  Otherwise, run.  ""Nemo!  Nemo!  Nemo!""  Shuddup and get me outta here!","

"fearfulofspiders","12 September 2008","For nearly a decade, The Lion King ruled as the highest-grossing animated film of all time, and deservingly so. Right next to it in greatness and achievement is Finding Nemo, a beautiful and engaging story about the love and devotion a father has for his son.The acting is all great here, and no one is showing less than 110%. The comedy is fantastic, and is vastly superior to Pixar's previous and most recent productions. Some of the gags remain today, as moments of the movie continuously pop-up in daily conversations. The colors used are just spectacular. The opening shots of the coral reefs, to the forest of jellies, not one scene is bland.The story is cute, funny, and very enthralling. There's moments of pure terror that might be too much for a younger viewer, such as the Barracuda, the Angler Fish, and when everyone is scooped up in the fishing net. However terrifying that situation is, the dramatic tension and suspense is what keeps it grounded, and sends fear into the most hardened adult.Thomas Newman's score is very well done, and probably one of the best of 2003 -- right under The Return of the King.Overall, there is not one flaw in this film that I could point out that would alter my judgment. Everything is so fine-tuned and beautifully presented, it is Disney's greatest achievement in years, and I highly recommend it to any family.","

"Dingataca","12 October 2007","Finding Nemo, Pixar's best yet. Stunning visuals, a great star cast to voice it, an original and heartwarming story, and amazing humour. What more could you want!? Every character plays an important part in Finding Nemo, as opposed to movies that focus on the protagonists. The star cast that voiced this film were purely perfect, e.g. Ellen DeGeneres for Dory! That was absolutely brilliant! She steals the show!Finding Nemo, has what some Pixar/Disney films don't have. And that is morals. They aren't forced into you, they're very subtle, but they are strong enough to keep you thinking and to make an impact on you - which I think is fabulous. The moral is: Loving your kids is great...over-loving them isn't. A moral like this makes sense for the present and I'm sure many young people would understand and relate.The film also defines ""universal"". Many universal films you see have a couple of drops of crude humour, its harmless, as its too little for young kids to understand, but it's still there. Finding Nemo is completely clean, squeaky clean in fact.Whether you're 1 or 100, Finding Nemo is sure to please. This one is definitely a must watch.Watch it! I command you!","

"qball_82","30 August 2003","Hands down - this is the best movie I have seen all year. These days it's rare to come across a flick that has you walking out of the theater feeling like you really did get your money's worth, Finding Nemo is one of these.Being a late session, the entire audience consisted of teen/adult viewers and I feel confident enough to say, judging from the incredible amount of laughter, everyone enjoyed it. I certainly did.The three major selling points. The gorgeous rendered visuals, Pixar continues to out do themselves with every film they produce. You can't help but be amazed, and if it weren't for the colorful cartoony fish darting around on screen, you would swear this was filmed live.Secondly, the amazing voice acting, I dare say this film wouldn't have done half as well without it. You'll recognize a number of familiar voices in this film and they all do a wonderful job, but I have to say it, Ellen Degeneres completely steals the show. Her characterization of Dory had myself and the audience in stitches many a time.Bucket loads of humor and action mixed with some drama and quiet, poignant moments all tied up with a wonderful story, the most important aspect of all. With so many animation studios releasing these days, Pixar is the *only* one that is able to get it right, creating stories with heart that are able to connect with people of all ages, on every level. The tale of Finding Nemo is an enjoyable journey from start to finish and not once did I lose interest.I know this review is incredibly gushy and all, but I honestly cannot fault this film. I cannot wait to own it on DVD to see it again. With so much rubbish being released into cinemas, both animated and live-action, Finding Nemo is a gem. Adult, teenager, kid, whatever - do yourself a favor and go see it now.Long live Pixar.","

It was just a perfect viewing.I just love how the daddy of Nemo just wouldn't give up his search for his son. It was very sweet and I will say a couple tears did flow down my cheeks.

If I had to say anything, it is that this was probably the film that got people to fall in love with Ellen Degeneres.

"jafar-iqbal","23 September 2013","When his only child Nemo (Alexander Gould) is captured by divers in the Great Barrier Reef, his extremely shy and anxiety-ridden father (Marlin) sets out on a journey to rescue him. Along the way, he meets many friends and foes, including Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with a short-term memory.After 'Toy Story', 'Finding Nemo' is probably the Pixar movie everyone likes to talk about. It took me ten years to watch it, but it was well worth the wait. 'Finding Nemo' is a very good film. What makes the movie so good is what has made so many other Pixar movies so good – the emotion. Yes, visually, it's brilliant (and we'll get on to that), but that Pixar crowd has this amazing ability to tell great stories.In what has become a staple of the company, this film centres on the bond between two characters – in this case, father and son. The opening sequence is heartbreaking, and it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. The strength of that first scene is such that we invest in the relationship Marlin and Nemo have. We believe in Marlin's fear and Nemo's rebellion. I'd argue that Pixar were able to capture that emotion with much more depth in 'Up', but this was perfectly fine for a first attempt.More than the two leads, the show is stolen by the character of Dory. I've never seen Ellen DeGeneres act but she's extremely good with the voice. The role was supposedly written for her, and she makes the most of that opportunity. Laugh-out-loud funny at times, Dory is a delight to watch, and it's no surprise that she's the focal point of the upcoming sequel.As with all Disney/Pixar animations, there has to be humour, and there is a lot of humour. My only problem was that, for the sake of humour, the story does get sidetracked somewhat. Marlin's desperate search for Nemo gets put on the backburner as he's shooting the breeze with turtles, or taking part in vegetarian shark meetings. Okay, so it's for kids, so maybe I shouldn't look too deeply into it, but it did irk me.Of the Pixar movies I've seen, this isn't at the top. All three 'Toy Story' films probably trump it, and 'Up' is possibly just that bit more funnier; but, with such a strong filmography, 'Finding Nemo' coming up fifth (maybe sixth behind 'Wall-E') is not a disservice at all. Great for kids and adults, it's highly recommended.","

En route to becoming the highest grossing animated movie in history, and deservedly so, Finding Nemo is a real gem for both kids and their parents. Its first move in the right direction is setting the picture underwater. Amid a previously unseen and pleasantly quirky world of spaced-out sea turtles and 12-step program sharks, the movie presents a heartwarming story about a father's search for his son. Add in witty dialogue and extroadinary performances by both Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks and you got a movie that's too good to miss.","

"preppy-3","1 June 2003","Pixar Studios (with Walt Disney) has done another incredible computer-animated family film.  (Their previous works were Toy Story 1 & 2 and Monsters Inc).This one involves a clownfish (voiced by Albert Brooks) trying to find his young son who was ""captured"" by an Australian dentist for his fish tank in his office.  He's ""helped"" by another fish (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) who has no short-term memory.This film is just dazzling to watch.  The underwater sequences are beautiful, full of color and life.  In every single case the voices match the animals perfectly.  The jokes are great--they can appeal to both children and adults (my favorites were the shark being called Bruce--a reference to ""Jaws"" and DeGeneres trying to ""speak"" whale).  There are some scenes that might frighten very small children involving some vicious-looking animals with big, sharp teeth--but the movie is not violent or bloody at all (it IS G rated).Basically a really fun great film.  See it!","

Wonderfully enchanting animated instant classic from the geniuses at Pixar keep their winning streak alive with this remarkably lively tale about life under the sea and focusing on neurotic clownfish Marlin (ably voiced by Brooks in full panic mode) whose overprotective parenting gets the best of him when his only off-spring Nemo (Gould) winds up in the net of a diver from Australia, thus sending him on an incredible journey to reunite with his progeny. On hand to aid him is the dotty blue fish Dory (DeGeneres who is pitch-perfect hilarious and steals the show) whose positive sunny disposition is only circumvented by her consistent short-term memory loss making it a bumpy ride along.Fun for the entire family with some serious belly-laughs of one-liners and sight gags that deserve a second viewing to get them all. Kudos to Stanton (who co-directs with Lee Unkrich and voices a surfer-dude sea turtle dad) who co-wrote with Bob Peterson and David Reynolds the cleverly antic script. ). But it is the amazing visuals conceived via CGI that proves groundbreaking in capturing the absolute FEELING of being in the ocean's murky depths and uncharted splendor.

"Lejink","26 December 2007","I'll confess straight away to having a fish-tank indoors and admit to loving my fish. I've always coveted the tropical fish tank with their beautiful colouring but never been encouraged to take them on as they're notoriously short-lived. This lovely animated feature showed me what I 've been missing as well as royally entertaining me too. The twin stories are skilfully inter-cut in a proper cinematic way, combining Marlin & Dory's ocean-wide search for Nemo is well inter-cut with Nemo's attempts to escape captivity from the evil fish-tank (now I feel guilty about owning one!). The dialogue is smart, occasionally funny, rarely sentimental and well delivered by the not-so-starry cast (and all the better for it - people like Hanks and Murphy hardly need the income after all), even if Albert Brooks as Marlin keeps reminding me of a young Mel Brooks!. The real stars of course are the animators, bringing to life, well, sort of, all manner of aquatic effects, from a shoal of fish on the move, to turtles riding the current and even the depiction of whales in motion. There's a light ecological message too as you'd expect, pushed just far enough to register but not repel, particularly with the children in the primary target-audience and of course the expected stuff about father - son relationships, growing pains, generation gap - can't believe I'm writing this about a movie about cartoon fish. Anyway, lasting a just-right 90 minutes, Finding Nemo is a pleasant warm-hearted family entertainment and I'll certainly think twice next time my fish-tank filter breaks down!","

"paul2001sw-1","18 February 2014","Many of the earliest screen savers were of fish tanks - so perhaps it's fitting than an early computer-animated movie should have told a story of tropical fish. Some of Pixar's movies have had dark, poetic sides to them; but 'Finding Nemo' is a straight up children's adventure, with a whole shoal of colourful characters, a fast pace, and a positive, upbeat message. A few things made me smile but to me this is vanilla Pixar; there's a one dimensional story here, with little underlying depth, and the gorgeous animation is something we have come to take for granted from this studio. Compare, for example, the opening of this film and that of their later movie 'Up'; they cover similar ground, but the later film's treatment is altogether more poignant and adult.","

He ""felt"" so much larger and like the shark actually took up space.  You see the seaweed swaying in the water, etc...  There's no telling how long it took to put together.With that set aside, I didn't think the story was that great.  It was OK, but definitely overhyped.  And I was expecting a lot of laughs based on other reviews, but I laughed once.  The story wasn't very original either. Rather than a friend searching for a friend, it's the dad going on an adventure to find his son.  Along the way, he gets help from an oddball.

It is a heartwarming, as well as frequently funny film, it had me shedding tears on several occasions, the dedication of Marlin to find his lost son is powerful, making it hard to believe it is just a cartoon. My only issue was the lack of development for Nemo's friends at the dentist, we learn little about Gill and his crew, and their story does not conclude properly, which disappointed me. The voice actors are outstanding, perfectly delivering the personality traits and emotion of these characters as they struggle with this insane adventure, Albert Brooks conveys Marlin's sadness for his lost child, Ellen DeGeneres showcases Dory's amnesia perfectly and Willem Dafoe emphasizes Gill's desire for freedom effectively, as well as many other great performances, such as Geoffrey Rush as a helpful pelican.

"bigben5","23 November 2003","After seeing the God awful Bug's Life, I never wanted to see another Disney film again. When the previews for Finding Nemo came out, I dismissed the film as being another lousy attempt for Disney and Pixar to make money. You see I grew up in the 90's era, where all the characters would fall in love at first sight and where all of a sudden characters would get up and dance, sing and would have stupid animals that would tell dumb ass jokes to get you to laugh... So therefore I thought this movie would suck.How wrong I was.It was great from beginning to finish. The story as you know is about a insecure Clownfish named Marlin, who because he lost his wife and all but one of his children, is overly concerned about his remaining son Nemo. One day Nemo gets captured and Marlin swims out to try and save him. Along the way he bumps into a fish named Dory, with very short term memory, and so the adventure is begun. I'll be honest in saying that this IS the BEST Disney movie I have EVER seen. It is the BEST written and has the best acting. The story, alas, is not original but it is considered fresh considering all of the other movies they've made in the past. It rocks! The acting is great, the musical score is beautiful and the animation in this one is awesome. Kudos to writers on this one.Apparently someone finally woke up and realized that some us, just don't like singing songs anymore and stupid annoying animals. They've finally been able to target a wider audience by making the story appeal to adults more while keeping the characters appealing to children. I love it.So be sure to see this movie, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it.

What I do admire about this film were the underwater sequences, which proved to be rather vibrant and more cutting edge than the previous Pixar films.

With a vast array of fun characters and set pieces it is impossible to become bored, the humor spreads across every age range, from one of the most perfectly timed fart jokes, to Crush the turtle saying he waxes his shell, there's never a shortage of belly laughs. Pixar really nails down their message with his how far a father is willing to go to save his son, with an underlying theme of teamwork and acceptance. This is a film for animation and non animation fans alike, there's something in it for everyone, as it's just an absolute gem of a movie.","

"gazzo-2","8 November 2003","I loved it. Typical fun, touching, fast moving, intelligent Pixar flick ala 'Monsters Inc' and 'Toy Story'. I enjoyed the Three Sharks, the Turtle Race and of course, our friends in the Fishtank. You gotta like Willem Dafoe and Brad Garrett doing their things especially. Many fun gags-the Pelican(Geoffrey Rush!) and the Cliff Clavin fish school...great.
Lotsa heart too-you care about these guys an awful lot more than you do the live actor portrayals in 'Matrix Reloaded', within the first 4 minutes. This one will live on for ages as a classic. As for say, Shrek-it's like watching an old episode of 'Miami Vice' or 'Satruday Nite Live'-great fun at the time, but you hadda Be there, it's already real dated, and....it ain't holding up too good.**** outta ****. See this one again.","

"SnoopyStyle","5 April 2015","Clown fish Marlin and Coral start a new brood. Coral battles and loses to a barracuda. Only Marlin and one egg survive. Respecting Coral's wish, he names him Nemo and becomes an overprotective parent. Nemo sees a boat in the open waters. After being berated and belittled by Marlin, Nemo swims out and is captured by scuba divers. Marlin tries desperately to follow them with the help of turtles and Dory with short term memory lost. Meanwhile Nemo finds himself in the dental office aquarium and he must organize a break-out. The animation is great and the story is terrific. It's PIXAR after all. The best thing is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. She is hilarious and she's does great voice work. The short term memory lost is insanely funny.","

"Hitchcoc","7 August 2015","Pixar brings it on. This wonderful trip to the bottom of the sea is worth watching again and again. It centers around a misbehaving clownfish who gets himself taken away to a faraway place, with little hope of ever seeing his father again. The characters along the way are priceless, with clever dialogue, quirky sensibilities, and, ultimately, love for one another. The creators were able to capitalize on the innate, somewhat stereotypical, qualities of the individual sea denizens by using some of our current comic geniuses (like Ellen DeGeneres) and make them charming. If you've not seen this, make time. You don't even need the kids.","

"evandewangga97","6 February 2015","Animation, maybe one of the hardest movie to be made. It's filled with the digital image, that isn't easy to be changed. Once the scene is done, the editors sometimes don't want to remade or retake it. The ""cooking"" phase is in the writing section, must be ripe enough to be served by the editorial-department. Especially, when it comes to the blockbuster of cinema, just like ""Finding Nemo"". It's not worth when the screenplay is not as good as the editing, the emptiness of amazing animated feature. But, Pixar never miss the point of great movies,e from the technology in film editing, until the deep message for the young generation. For ""Finding Nemo"", Pixar gave so much visual pleasure with the classic problem of human life. And, still holds the reality of the fish in front of human. Yes, I mean it's from the fish perspective, and it's maybe happened in animal's life, but human haven't notice it yet, even fish is not as smart as in this movie. The colorful settings bring joy to every child who watch this. Moreover, the funny scenario, just added other delicious seasoning in this Pixar first mass blockbuster.Next, to the core of the story. It's simply entertaining and cinematic. I mean this story can be told only by movie, not story or music, etc. Two points of view, with exact transition. The beginning, is honestly like a template-idea. But, just the intro, not the entire. The classic problem of family is given with humble way of cinema. A dad-son relationship, which every child probably feel it, so does the father. More than that, Pixar still gives the smart and funny comedy. Children is pleasant with the animation, story, and the comedy. What's more for them to enjoy. The film actually doesn't only takes one or two settings. It is an adventure, and has many powerful scene. Every scene with new supernumerary, but with educating characterization. Yes, why not added some sciences for children. Catchy fish in every scene, and though-provoking plot. They can't leave the cinema before the end of the movie.And, I may add some critics on this new-standard of animation. Again, maybe some blockbuster not as good as the non-visual-effects- movie. I mean it is good, not excellent. For the warm-up of studio, it is great, but let's not talk about the dimension of time. I really know the perfection of animation, but why not add some more twisting and deep plot. You know ""Toy Story"", is just what Pixar done in genius way. Focus on some deeper characterization of that extra-character and it could be really delightful. My opinion is just for another Pixar's movie. It has already got the mass-editing- experience. And it's ready to launch another classic to the upcoming generation. With that superb quality, and the developing technology, I think Pixar will be made some other ""Finding Nemo""s. And I expect with the mass-effects and wonderfully-written story.A must watch of every 2000's generation, a beginning of new era of American animation.","

"moviewizguy","18 March 2006","Just keep swimming...--This is a line from the movie that is funny. This film is simple. A fish gets kidnap by humans and his father goes on a look out for him with a help of Dory.Dory has a short term memory that runs through her family. Or maybe its not. Well, she's played by the funny Ellen DeGeneres. She's the one who makes everyone laugh during the whole film. This film is funny for both kids and adults. It's really entertaining with peril here and there. This film is also sad, including the beginning that is hard to see, even for me.The animation, overall, is great. Obviously, Pixar's animation is always great and it'll never become bad. It's wonderful to see the ocean. Everywhere is colorful on the screen. This is a masterpiece. It'll soon become a classic. This film is not overrated. It's fine where it is right now. This is the best animated film of 2004, in my opinion. The moral of the story is good for all of the parents to hear: Do not become over protective to your kids. Sooner or later you'll have to let them go with their own life. Ellen is the perfect character for Dorry. She's just adorable that it makes you put a smile in your face.This is an entertaining and funny piece of work. It's great for all ages and everyone should see it. Go SEA it and have a hopping good time!","

"doug_funnie","2 December 2003","Pixar has done it again, it seems that whenever Pixar and Disney come out with a movie it is always a tremendous success, and Finding Nemo is no exception. This is the best Pixar film yet and it will be tough to beat. The visual effects are amazing; everything in this Pixar ocean looks so real, from the sand to the sunlight hitting the water. You almost feel like you're underwater and it's hard to imagine that this is animation is not real. The voice work just adds to the animation and makes the movie that much better. Hands down, Ellen DeGeneres is the best in this movie; her voice work as Dory is just hilarious. Every scene that Dory is in I couldn't help but laugh, and with help from the script, the film has some of the funniest scenes in a children's movie. This movie is perfect for kids as it will amuse and entertain them or whoever else may be watching with them. The animation literally comes alive, the humor is everywhere and this all makes Finding Nemo a movie that is extremely enjoyable to watch.","

"merrywood","16 December 2003","FINDING NEMO is a typical Pixar product: A stunning visual enterprise.  Its avant-garde computer imaging technology wiped out the century old, cel animation process.  It's done, curiously enough, by a studio headed by former Walt Disney people who for some reason bolted Disney to form their own shop.  One can only guess why.  Of course, Disney will distribute. After all it's not only entertaining product but fulfills the single ultimatum of Hollywood: Make Money.  Forget Shakespeare's injunction: to celebrate life.Thus, we find ourselves with an engaging story about a father fish in search of his missing, remaining son after a mean barracuda has gobbled up his spouse and other offspring.  Alas, a skin-diving Australian dentist has lifted the son for the tank in his office, to be held there for Darla, his ever-so-frightening, brainless, little daughter.   Finding Nemo is always interesting to watch.  It's a, very clever, sometimes hilarious, six-minute, shtick-filled cartoon stretched into 100 minutes. One can forgive its story flaws in all the fun.  However, the use of a talented, well-known actor like Albert Brooks in the lead role is puzzling. Disney himself avoided the use of major names in order to evade the audience confusion of hearing an easily imaged voice coming out of a drawn character. The most distinct instance of this is in SNOW WHITE where he chose the completely unknown voice of Adriana Caselotti over the reigning voice of the day, Deanna Durbin.  Shamus Culhane, for whose biography I helped him find a publisher and who worked on that classic film, assured me that the decision to use Caselotti (who passed at 80 in 1997) was intentional and not forced by the then prevailing funding shortage.  This was Disney's first feature length cartoon and he wanted the best for it.  Indeed, it lives today, still, over half a century later, as meaningful as the day it was released.
Finally, the most unfortunate aspect of NEMO, an otherwise fine product, is its lack of meaning.  It lacks my hallmark for greatness, a soul at its center.  As such, NEMO, like all of the other Pixar products thus far, will be long forgotten when films like SNOW WHITE and PINOCCHIO are still being heralded as classics.  Why Pixar does this when it has a $94 million budget to lavish on a product begs the question: A shallow fish story in deep water.","

"Quinoa1984","11 June 2003","Finding Nemo, from co-directors Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich (who have worked as directors on past pixar films like Bug's life and Toy Story 2) have devised an adventure film that takes the viewer far beyond anything imaginable with Little Mermaid. In fact, much of the humor and dialogue reminded me of the sophistication that went with an animated movie like Antz, where the top celebrity personalities came forth to give voice to wonderful creature creations.And speaking of Antz, this time there is a neurotic, obsessive caricature of a comic in Finding Nemo, here named Marlin and played by Albert Brooks. After his wife, a clown fish, and his hundreds of eggs are devoured by a larger fish, he finds one egg left and becomes compulsive in securing it's safety. His son Nemo, it turns out, gets caught in a diver's net and taken to a Dentist's office in Sydney, Australia. This sets Marlin off on his quest across the ocean, along with a fish who forgets things as soon as their mentioned, voiced by Ellen Degeneres. They encounter sharks in rehab, turtles with Californian accents, a whale (quasi-Pinnochio there), and much more, all the while little Nemo, inside the fish-tank and renamed Sharkbate, starts to gain the courage his father never considered he had, and vice-versa.The Pixar team, like in their previous treats, deliver worlds that usually can only exist in the imagination - the under-the-ocean scenes, making up about 65 percent of the film, are obviously breathtaking in design while not going overboard in realism, and the scenes in the dentist office and on the pier are precise too. It's like we've thought we've been here before, but now the filmmakers take us right into the nexus of it. This splendor, along with the voice work by Brooks, Degeneres, Willem Dafoe as the leader of the fish-tank pack, Geoffrey Rush as a pelican, and all the supporting parts, give anyone in any age group the finest animated spectacle of the summer. By the way, those seagulls are the funniest thing Pixar's come up with since the aliens in Toy Story!","

"ldavis-2","13 June 2003","The critics are gaga over this, but neither myself nor my 6 year old were. I was disturbed by how Marlin was ridiculed for being (understandably) over-protective. While the ""can do"" attitude toward his handicap is heartening, Nemo remains the same brat he was when he put the story into motion. ""Nemo"" struck me as anti-family (strange to say about a ""family picture"") in how the parent was the one was expected to grow up, not the child.It had some scary moments. The ""whale talking"" got old real fast. But, the anti-American jab (which got the biggest laugh) was outrageous. Hollywood hates Bush so much, it has to shoehorn its politics into the one place where it doesn't belong! Here's a weird idea: how about letting children have a childhood, and save the Bush-is-Hitler stuff for the grown ups?","

"educallejero","24 August 2018","Ellen DeGeneres/Dory: What to say about this? Apparently, if youre famous you can't do anything wrong? She's beyond annoying, but she's never funny. Her voice is disgusting to listen too, so if the intent was to capture how annoying that type of character with a memory problem could be, that was a good job, but totally unnecessary and harmed the movie. That character didn't need a recognizable voice but a sweet one. The situation was annoying (and could've been funny) without an annoying voice.Barry Humphries/Shark Bruce: And then this. My GOD. How can you screw up a shark? The thing of not wanting to eat fish was clever (playing with Sharks sense of smell). But again, the voice was obnoxious (when he was on eating mode) and dumb (otherwise) rather than terrifying and dumb, which is the way it should've been.You had WILLEM DAFOE and GEOFFREY RUSH BUT YOU GAVE THIS PART TO BARRY WHO?

Like most Pixar movies, Finding Nemo too deals with universal themes  parenting, father-son relationship & friendship. With his crisp, funny & sometimes thought-provoking dialogues, director Andrew Stanton takes you on an adventure ride under the rich and colorful sea full of interesting creatures. This movie is so engrossing that you sometimes forget it is just an animation, especially when you see animated characters display genuine human emotions. Dory is the most unforgettable character I've come across in animated movies. Other characters too remain etched in your memory long after you've seen the movie. This movie certainly deserves a spot among the top movies of this century.","

"suicidalicecreamtruckdriver","1 August 2009","SO Nemo gets lost in the sea, and his father Marlin decides to find him. Simple set up, yet done so well and is a visual achievement with the best form of animation. With the original characters, it never settles for cheap laughs and is something that the whole family can enjoy, because everything works here. Of course, it being Pixar, it has been perfected to every inch, it is enjoyable and fun. However, it has it's single flaw that makes me not give it a complete 10: It never settles for anything original besides the characters. You could mistake this film for a human bashing exercise for kids. Yet I'm sure the kids won't mind: even if the only kid in the story is actually, well, evil. Without giving anything away, it will give your kids an interest in the ocean for three odd weeks and then they go back to littering. And on a note, non- Australians will see how beautiful the harbour is, whilst Australians will realize that the boats are on the wrong side. Still, it is fun for the whole family ENTERTAINMENT: 10 VOICE/ACTING: (Credits to Ellen DeGenres, Williem Dafoe and Barry Humpries as the hilarious Bruce 'the vegetarian' shark) 10 ORIGINALITY: 6 AS A FILM: 9","

It is uncomplicated by any element not approved by committee, which means you get regurgitated under-sea relationships, with slightly modernized shtick. (Yep, there's a shark chase, but he's in recovery ?!) Take any three familiar mass market plot lines and average them together and you get something as tepid as this. This movie was gone from my mind the second it ended. I don't recall a frame of it.The only way you could be a fan of this movie is if you think a movie is supposed to spell everything out for you and cause you to emote every twenty minutes. It never touched me and it never engaged me. Nobody ever went broke tossing look-alike projects at undiscerning American audiences.","

"Atreyu_II","3 September 2008","I am really not big on CGI productions because what I really like are the old cartoons drawn by hand. However, ""Finding Nemo"" isn't such bad for a CGI production. It isn't ""Cars"", but it's a little better than ""Toy Story"" for example, and much better than movies like ""Shrek"", ""Madagascar"" and so on...""Finding Nemo"" is technically very acceptable. It has great graphics which make the whole scenario look so real and so natural. The story is clever and the movie has lots of dangerous adventures lived by a clownfish and a funny regal tang with memory problems. However, although the graphics are in general good thanks to its quality sceneries and well-designed various fish species, the human characters are awfully designed, especially that horrible little girl who looks like the annoying Sid from ""Toy Story"".Aside the movie's faults, generally speaking the movie is okay, entertaining enough and offers fun for everyone who's watching it. The movie has some quite funny gags, such as whenever a character says something like «He's a clownfish, but he's not funny at all». Another good joke is when Marlin is trying to tell a joke to the sharks and, while he's making a fool out of himself, he suddenly yells «Nemo!!!». Bruce (the shark) is a funny and interesting character. Bruce is a very humorous shark and he's got a funny way to invite the fishes for a dinner with his other two friends sharks. After all, «fishes are their friends». Oh, by the way, I think it's very good that for once a movie includes a blue whale, which is a very forgotten animal in animated films. It is the biggest animal on Earth and it sure is a fantastic creature.Overall, one of Pixar's best films (although not a tremendous film for me) and better than the overvalued and overrated ""Toy Story"".","

"shani_dayo","6 September 2015","I will not say this film was excellent, and I will not say it was plain awful either. It was somewhere in the middle for Me, it is a cute family film if You have Young kids, but it is missing something. The beginning is everything, it can make or break a film, now the start to finding Nemo set the tone for the movie and served it's purpose well. The movie had nice points but at times became boring and seemed to drag on, leaving Me wishing that I could skip on to the good parts. Basically this Male clownfish has a wife in the beginning with dozens of newborn eggs who will develop into little fish, a large creature comes attacks the family, knocks Him out, kills His wife, and all of His eggs but one, Nemo His Son who He will become protective off. Then We see how Nemo becomes a energetic but hardheaded child and get's into trouble, even landing Him in a situation were He is taken by Man and dropped in a fish tank. His Dad searches for Him like any parent would, and He runs into a few new friends on the way, including an unintelligent Female fish named Dori. After this, a bunch of foolishness they find the kid and the end...yay? Anyway the movie is short of heartfelt and emotional, just simply to keep Your 5-8 year old kid's attention. It can teach You to keep going in life though, I will give it that. I have seen better, but then again I have also seen worse. It is a pretty simple non-complex storyline that is easy to follow, but doesn't leave You with anything to think about. I have high standers for Kid's film actually, I believe they should be given quality movies and life lessons because they are our youth and the future, not just any mindless old thing. It's okay to have a comedy once in a while that is funny hahaha, but this movie just isn't it and leaves a lot to be desired. It is just plain flat and stale for Me, in no way a classic, or something I will remember for years to come. I would say let Your little kids watch the movie, older ones may not enjoy it.","

"bhaveshbhatia","14 September 2012","Honestly, there is nothing new to speak about the movie. Finding Nemo in 2003 and Finding Nemo 3D in 2012 are identical. However, everything seems new thanks to the 3D animation added to the original. Therefore, if anyone is the hero of the movie, it is the 3D effect. The 3D effect made the Great Barrier Reef come alive. It makes Finding Nemo 3D worth watching. As for the story, this movie teaches us the same thing that it did in 2003 – Friendship and never-say-die attitude. It also teaches us never to back down or give up. Once again what surprises us is the very reason this movie received the Best Academy Award (Animation) in 2003 - here daddy the hero, daddy knows best, daddy is sure nothing is impossible for his son Nemo. For Nemo, he cannot see any fish stronger than his daddy.There are enough elements in the movie for people watching it for the first time and also for those who are watching it after almost 9 years. One would surely be amazed when they get to see the beauty that lies beneath the sea and that too in 3D. Clownfish, Regal Tang, Oysters, Sharks, Whales, Sea monsters and many other sea-creatures in 3D is an effect you don't want to miss. I will suggest you to watch Finding Nemo 3D if you have never seen the movie before.Also watch the movie if you have seen it already, because this time around the adventure is in 3D!","

It's a slower-paced movie than a lot of the other Pixar films and, quite frankly, it bored me a lot. My mother liked it, so I went along with it, but it was never my kind of thing.It's a beautifully animated film that's appealing to look at, and it hasn't lost a bit of its quality in that regard with the passing of time. The voice acting is great and, according to Google, it was scored by Randy Newman (who, yet again, I'm not a big fan of). But the biggest appeal of this film is Ellen Degeneres playing the forgetful fish Dory. She was the comic relief in an otherwise grim film, and I think a big part of the film's appeal relies on her and her ability to offer up the lighthearted forgetfulness and stupidity.Overall, though, even on subsequent viewings, the film doesn't really do a lot for me in terms of maintaining interest. It's most definitely worth a watch for anyone who hasn't seen it before, but it's not in my top 5 Pixar films.","

"tightspotkilo","17 December 2005","I have watched this film umpteen times with my 3 year-old granddaughter (I own the DVD), and I'm going to go against the grain and say that, while others may say that Finding Nemo doesn't quite measure up, I say that in many ways this film excels. I believe that what most people find lacking in Finding Nemo is the adult-oriented humor. And it's true, there is very little of it here. There is nothing approaching the risqué or double entendres here either, those things that are supposed to go over the kids' heads and give the adults a big guffaw. So, as a result, adults looking for that kind of stuff don't find it and are therefore disappointed. But if my granddaughter is any kind of a yardstick to measure it by, the kids love it.While this film may not be a masterpiece, it's the next best thing to it. That's because the artwork is superb, unparalleled and unmatched. The coloration, textures, use of light, and shadings are the finest that have ever been done on any animated film ever, before or since. Shrek2 and Shark's Tale, for instance, came out *after* this movie, and, good as they are (and they are very good) they are nowhere near as beautifully rendered as Finding Nemo. Particularly Shark's Tale, which in some ways seemed to be a blatant theft and rip off from Finding Nemo, but in my opinion fails because it's just not as good, either art-wise or story-wise. But Finding Nemo remains a visually beautiful piece of artwork, and the kids love it. And that counts for a lot.","

"WheezyJoe","13 January 2004","Wow, the digital realm is easily forgotten when you first lock eyes on the visual wonder created for yet another charming tale from Disney/Pixar Animation. `Finding Nemo' is Pixar's fifth outing and after a moderately spotless track record they keep this one swimming in a wealth off colour and three-dimensional form. Their visual language has proven to be a clear and successful method of storytelling. It captures the imagination and accommodates some fairly decent stories to-boot. And what setting could be more exciting than Australia's exotic eastern coastline.
But it's a mix of Pixar's wonderful craft and a well written story that keeps audiences enthralled, and this time director/writer Andrew Stanton serves up just that, on a silver platter. What remains is the winning formula of comedy and gravity within the screenplay. Stanton has been involved with all of the other Pixar features in the past, and it shows. Even deep under the ocean, far removed from the human subtleties that are woven into usual animations, is a rich tapestry of lifelike environments and genuine character's that are easy to connect and relate to. And in the usual Pixar tradition you get a film that bridges the age boundary and becomes wholly enjoyed by all, young and old.I enjoyed myself for the entire duration of `Finding Nemo' (that included the final credits). I recommend it to all, no matter what your cinematic preference may be. Besides the lavish visual elements that have made Pixar much admired this has been a labor of love for Andrew Stanton that started way back in 1992, prior to Toy Story. It's a new development in the path the entire production house is heading. Thomas Newman's involvement in writing music for this project shows us exactly that as his score gives the film a new emotional style. It's also a `new high water mark' for CGI (computer generated image) animation in general. Pixar is now an established force in animation but politely recognizes others in the industry as well. For example you have the address (amongst other things) Wallaby Way that will be instantly recognizable to ""Wallace and Gromit"" fans and a way-cool Sea Turtle (Crush, voiced by Stanton himself) with a very close resemblance to those four ninja friends of his. There are also plenty of fun references to Jaws, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Monty Python and nearly every previous (and upcoming) Pixar feature. You also have Pixar's own Joe Ranft, who made famous the character of Heimlich the caterpillar from `A Bug's Life', making another special appearance as the voice of Jacques the cleaner shrimp. Kids won't get these in-jokes but for the adults it's a warm welcome. But, when it comes down to it `Finding Nemo' is aimed at just about anyone, as long as you enjoy a well-told and inventive story. From the vibrantly lush to the murky dark this is an absolute lure for the eyes and a treat for the funnybone. Score - 4 out of 5","

"A Jay","10 December 2003","Quite why I haven't commented on this before is beyond me, but still, here I amPut simply, Finding Nemo is a brilliant film with funny and endearing characters that are a joy to watch. Pixar have again pushed the boundaries of computer animation to bring us a realistic yet still cartoonish film that will appeal to anyone from 3 to 103. I'm sure most people's favourite bit was the whale speak by Dory, which had me in stitches. However other little incidents in the film really made me laugh so much. When the little baby fish falls off the sponge bed is so typical of how children react when they hurt themselves. The animators and writers at Pixar really know how to capture the way people react to situations. All the little facial expressions throughout the film are beautifully animated.The water effects must have been tremendously difficult to achieve, but they are fantastic. The lighting changes that were required really help set the mood of a scene, even when Marlin and Dory were inside the whale. The story although basic was successfully pulled off with no dip in any of the action. The story kept going when it shifted between Marlin's desperate attempt to locate his son, and Nemo's dispair of being alone with no one to look after him except the new collection of strange friends in the dentist fish tank.
Overall I give it 10/10 because it was great. I can't wait for The Incredibles next year, I'm sure it will be just as good.","

"pinstripe","30 July 2003","Out of all of Disney's co-attempts at modern cartoonism with their Pixar partnership, Finding Nemo was the least appealing, and least captivating. The story describes a father and son clown fish who are separated when the boy is kidnapped from their coral housing, and the father so bluntly [as the title projects] searches for ""finding Nemo,"" and that is your entire movie plot. [Now, spoilers]The search is endless and takes the fun out of Disney and Pixar.  Whereas Toy Story was also based on the ""eternal search quest"" type of story model, at least the characters were beloved, and captivating.  Yes, Nemo is a cute fish who the audience love due to his strong nature, and messed up fins, but he can hardly carry the film on his own.  Disney even hired Ellen DeGeneres in to voice Marlin's [Nemo's father, Albert Brooks] trip companion, Dory. But it's hard to not look at the fish and think of Ellen.  Personally, I know that when I watch a cartoon, I want to be taken away in the art and not refer back to real life and the pop culture surrounding it. 
The rest of the cast is mostly ho-hum, and the story just drags on until [literally] the fish comes home.  It was certainly a good attempt, but by the nature of the too-cool surfer turtles that Nemo meets along his way, it's clear that these movies' goodness has abruptly started to head down that dreary road where the creators are trying to appeal to everyone, and just starting to scare half the audience into other interests.","

"nickmesafilms","9 July 2011","Talking toys! Talking bugs! Talking monsters! Now, there's talking fish? Awesome! The movie, ""Finding Nemo"" takes place on a father who tries to find his lost son fish, with the help of a fish with a load of short-term memory loss, portrayed by Ellen DeGeneres, which made me laugh a lot. Along the way, they encounter sharks, sea turtles, jellyfish, and tank fish. The story then explains a true loving message of father and son. Okay, I think Nemo is another personal favorite film from Pixar. The story felt true to life, the characters were all hilarious, including Dory, the best Pixar character ever, for most of the laughs, and the heart of this tale kept beating like it was going to teach a big lesson where to respect your loved ones, and taught the true meaning of father and son. And they use this true fact with talking fish! How cool is that? ""Finding Nemo"" was quite a story to die for, and the story was so loving and sometimes heartbreaking that everybody wants to see a movie like this! Looks like Pixar has a soft side of drama, and has a big heart for family. This is a movie that I can watch over and over again, and I'll never be tired of it. This is one of the best animated films of all time. ""Finding Nemo"", in my review, ""a loving portrait of father and son, with talking fish"".","

"eldreddsouza","23 May 2021","When the film started I honestly was kinda bummed and thought this film was just another overrated nonsense. The whole Nemo getting lost thing seemed kinda forced. An overprotective father causing his son to get annoyed and in turn disobey him which eventually leads him to get trapped by a diver felt annoying because all this feels like it could have easily been avoided. But then in order to enjoy it I thought it would be best to ignore that part and to watch the rest of the movie with an open mind. As the film progresses I find myself actually engrossed and enjoying the scenes as they come along. The new characters, Dory, shark, turtles, etc. Are introduced who are quite fun and interesting. The shark part was a bit unnecessary though. They could've kept it as a friendly shark or something, but the bloodshed was too much I feel since it is a kids movie.The last 45 minutes of the film are the best as we are taken out of the ocean for a breath of fresh air and are in a search for Nemo. The dentist scenes are the funniest part of the movie and the little cruel girl haha is the highlight for me as it is during her scenes that I found myself laughing the most. It's a pretty cool story and the way the fishies in the tank act to Help Nemo return back to the ocean is pretty wholesome and sends out a good message to kids.It's really impressive how fine the animation is in a film released in '03. It's just beautiful to look at and especially the scenes that are outside the water.Extremely beautiful film. You may feel bored or annoyed I the start but it just gets so much better and ends on a high note.","

Why else has Disney's conventional animation studio quit?This is your only spoiler warning...The allegory here is actually hidden pretty well.  Bruce and his rehab pals are the Disney executives, marketers and accountants who determine when they are financially grounded.  They claim they are abandoning old ways for groundbreaking ones, but when the smell of successful formula comes along...you get the idea.How does this apply?  Look at the Disney ""classics"".  Disney doesn't rerelease them to the public at intervals because they want a new generation to appreciate them.  They time their rereleases for when their new ideas flop and they need fast cash.  After 'Home on the Range' and 'Alamo', expect to see 'Cinderella' back on shelves.We the public are the seagulls, flying about and selfishly smacking into things.  Don't believe me?

It also has to be the funniest Disney movie ever made. I hope there is a sequel to this. The only problem is what they are going to call it. They'll have to call it something else unless they're finding Nemo again. Anyway, getting back to this movie, I thought that the absent-minded fish Dori was the funniest character. I also thought those Seagulls that always said ""Mine"" was funny. For some reason when I first saw the movie I thought those Gulls were saying ""Mike"".

You know, you could cut out half of these cliffhanger sequences and give us some characterization or some sweet memorable moments. Now THAT would be a good family film.  This is the most visually striking of all Pixar movies, and the most disappointing as a family entertainment. Pass this one up if you have younger children, please!","

"AMIO-PatricioMunoz","4 September 2003","3D Animation Quality:  Beautiful  5/5  (truly spectacular)Story:  Meh! Lacks creativity 1/5 (Find a better script next time)My 2-Cents:Disney and Pixar are an amazing team.  Pixar has put together some really nice films that will go down in history for their impact in the animation industry.  There is no question that this film was an excellent a crowd drawer and everything Disney and the industry needed at this time.I love Pixar and their contributions to contemporary cinema.  The film however was a great disappointment to me.  One of the things I have grown to enjoy when watching a Pixar Film is their shorts before the actual movie begins.  They showed their classic short, ""Knick Knack"" which was produced in way back in 1989.  I was hoping to see a new short.  I loved ""Geri's Game"" and ""For the Birds"".My biggest beef was not about that.  It involved the story itself.  Toy Story 1 & 2 was written to appeal to both young and older audiences. Finding Nemo seemed to have it's target directly on the kids.  There's nothing terribly wrong w/ that, it's just the story was too simple.  It seemed like the movie was jammed full of FILLER just to lengthen the movie. We could have done without the sharks, for example.  Their role in the film was simply to extend it by a couple of minutes.The novelty of 3D animation is gone.  It's not the 1990's anymore.  People are familiar with complex 3D animation.  It's everywhere we look.  Pixar cannot rely on drawing an audience simply because the film is a 3D animation.  Remember how poorly Final Fantasy did?  The film had great animation with incredibly realistic human characters.  Square One did an amazing job on the animation that just blew me away.  But the story was not appealing to the mass audience.  So, where are they now?  The movie BOMBED and the company literally went bankrupt.Pixar should remember one thing.  Parents have to sit through the film too. Just spend a little more time on the script for your next movie.You haven't lost a loyal viewer in me, however.  I have a lot of faith in John Lasseter's team. I expect great things from the Pixar and Disney in the near future!","

"theinaniloquent","15 October 2011","After his son is captured in the Great Barrier Reef and taken to Sydney, a timid clown fish sets out on a journey to bring him home.I hate people bashing on animated movies for it being too childish or too.. animated. I, myself, will have to say (other than Pixar) I agree. But what Pixar has done to animated movies is just genius. To start off, Finding Nemo presents a lot of hidden adult themes that adults would only understand. It also contains heart, which no animated movie has ever done. It makes you actually feel for an animated creature and that is just almost magic. Pixar explores childhood in a way nothing else can, and I just adore these movies. I also have to admit, Finding Nemo put a tear in my eye (and for an animation) that is just complete brilliance. I respect Pixar for doing these such things. The film also has amazing voice acting and you can actually see the emotion the actors put out to make this movie, something only Pixar could do. This movie is an absolute heartwarming, hilarious adventure that digs into your heart and toys with your emotions. For all you punks out there you cannot look past the childish aim, you are missing out incredibly. This is definitely the best animated film. 10/10.","

"Drew48","30 August 2008","I love this movie. Although it has a sad beginning, it's a wonderfully funny & touching movie. Albert Brooks' character, Marlin, is very funny as the overly cautious (with reason to be) father. And Nemo is a sweet kid, who manages not to seem bratty at all even when he's being defiant. All the main characters are super funny (& endearing) whether in the sea or in the aquarium. Examples: Bruce & friends are sharks that don't want to eat fish (though it's hard to fight their natural urges); and Jacques is a neat freak, so naturally very bothered when they decide to let the tank get filthy in order to force the owner to clean it, allowing them the chance to possibly escape. However, Ellen DeGeneres' character, Dory, tops them all though. She suffers from short-term memory loss (at times, very short-term), which makes for many laughs. And she thinks she can speak whale, which makes even just stating that very funny. One of my favorite parts is when she tells Marlin that they're not the only two ones in here (the ocean, that is). Basically, it's one of my favorite movies.","

Nemo's journey is one of self discovery, of living with a disability and all of the hurdles that creates in your life. It's about the way it makes others look at you and how she overcomes that. Not with some miracle cure that instantly solves everything or erases the issue altogether in the end, but with honest to goodness character growth.","

His father Marlin is then forced to face his fears and travel through the ocean with the help of Dory to try and get to his son.FINDING NEMO is one of the most beloved Pixar films and while I didn't think it was as great as TOY STORY 3 or UP, it's certainly a classic animation film that has a lot going for it. Obviously the animation itself is wonderful and it's really amazing how great the look of the film was. You really can forget that you're watching an animated movie because the visuals are so great that you just get sucked up into the atmosphere of the movie.The greatest thing the film has going for it is the fact that the story itself is just so great. Obviously the main plot is the fact that this father loves his son more than anything and is willing to do whatever it takes to save him. This here is an easy set-up and the adventure that follows has one terrific sequence after another. There are so many fascinating characters and situations that Marlin and Dory get into along the way that you can't help but laugh and be caught up in the story.The vocal performances are all terrific and especially Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres. Their comic timing together is perfect and we get other great work from Willem Dafoe, Alexander Gould and Austin Pendleton.

That really doesn't have anything to do with the movie, but until ""Finding Nemo"" came along, I had never given my friend Nemo's nickname a second thought.I have to say, the picture was pretty clever with it's characters and dialog. When little Nemo wound up in Australia I was asking myself how the writers were going to pull off the long shot of having father Marlin track him down and get him back to the ocean. They actually did it in a way that seemed believable enough even though you have to stretch your sensibilities. You could say the same about some serious dramas that are being made today.This one is tailor made for kids young and old and it's message of persevering against all odds is a valuable one. There's also some slick inside jokes if you're quick enough to keep up the pace; the summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie still has me cracking up.","

"lee_eisenberg","15 April 2006","I guess that what truly differentiates the children's movies that my generation has grown up watching from those of previous generations is the various references to other things (think the popular culture references in ""Shrek"" I and II, and the genie's Rodney Dangerfield and Jack Nicholson imitations in ""Aladdin""). ""Finding Nemo"" brilliantly continues this. It focuses on Marlin (Albert Brooks), a tense clown-fish searching for his son Nemo, who got caught by an Australian dentist. Along the way, Marlin meets Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a big blue fish with short-term memory. Maybe it sounds too wimpy to say that the movie is about the importance of having solid relationships in one's life, but you might say that.And the popular culture references? I never would have imagined a kids' movie spoofing scenes from Alfred Hitchcock's and Stanley Kubrick's movies, but they do it here. I don't know how they did it, but they did it. A very well done movie. Also starring Willem Dafoe, Brad Garrett, Allison Janney, Austin Pendleton, Geoffrey Rush and Eric Bana (those last two of course later co-starred in ""Munich"").","

"Tweekums","1 September 2016","Marlin in a timid clown fish living with his son Nemo in an anemone on the Great Barrier Reef that is until Nemo is captured by a diver. Now Marlin must brave the dangers of the open ocean to find Nemo again. He is accompanied by a regal blue tang named Dory; Dory has a problem with her short term memory so quickly forgets everything. Together they find a mask lost by one of the divers and learn that they came from Sydney; on the way there they encounter sharks, an angler fish, jelly fish and a group of sea turtles. Meanwhile Nemo finds himself in the aquarium of a North Sydney dentist. Here he meets a variety of other fish and learns that the dentist intends to give him to his niece as a pet something that means almost certain death given how she treated the previous fish she was given.This, Pixar's fifth film, got off to a great start, it was darker than I expected but done in a way that shouldn't be too upsetting for even the youngest of viewers. Marlin's wife is killed by a barracuda and every egg except Nemo is lost but none of the details are shown. Once that is over it quickly moves on to introducing young Nemo then his capture by the diver that sets the story in motion. The parallel stories of Marlin, and his new friend Dory, searching for Nemo and Nemo's interaction with the other fish in the aquarium and their plans for his escape are nicely interwoven. Each has plenty of drama; none of it is too scary though and where there are scary moments they are lightened by some comedy such as the trio of sharks that are trying to stop eating fish. The characters may be fish but they still have plenty of personality; especially the central trio of Marlin, Dory and Nemo. Each of these is distinctive; Marlin is timid and pessimistic, Nemo is full of youthful enthusiasm and Dory is cheery despite her memory problems. The secondary characters are fun too; I particularly liked the 'surfer-dude' sea turtles! As one would expect from Pixar the animation is top notch, the undersea environment looks fantastic and the actors who provide the voices to the characters to an excellent job. Overall this is a fun film that, while aimed at a younger audience, can be enjoyed by all ages.","

"studioAT","6 March 2013","Finding Nemo wasn't one of my favourite Pixar films when I first saw it but with every passing watch my enjoyment of it increases.First of all visually it's stunning. Should it ever be re-released in 3D it would be quite a treat because the way the ocean is created on screen is magic.Like all the best Pixar films (and probably any kids film) it appeals to both adults and children with a simple story that is overflowing with warm characters (with a few famous voices thrown in with good measure) and the ability to make you laugh and cry. Pixar really do excel at making quality family films that I have no doubt will be entertaining audiences for many a generation to come.I have my doubts about the proposed Finding Nemo 2 but it's ultimately a case of 'in Pixar we trust'.","

"tavm","21 September 2012","So nine years after first enjoying this at theatres, I decided to watch this again in 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend. I was astounded to find out how much I forgot since that first time so I was mostly experiencing this as if I hadn't seen this before which made for a wonderfully touching, thrilling, and, of course, very funny time for both me and my friend. So hearing Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres as Marlin and Dory brought plenty of laughter from me especially from the latter. And seeing their adventures in looking for Marlin's son Nemo was even more pleasurable when we find out who all three main players encounter. Really, all I'll say now is if you like seeing classic movies on the big screen, I highly recommend you once again watch Finding Nemo at your neighborhood movie house right now!","

"michaelRokeefe","28 September 2009","You can't find too many animated features more revered. Oscar winning FINDING NEMO, is an adventure for Nemo(voice)(Alexander Gould)and a drama from his father Marlin's(voice)(Albert Brooks)view point. The Great Barrier Reef is full of dangers to be aware of. Its also nice that you can stay close to friends for a safe existence. On Nemo's first day of school, he defies his father by swimming out too far from the coral to inspect a boat. Nemo, the little clown fish, is soon scooped up by a diver. Marlin realizing his son has been fish-napped...and in desperation will go against all odds to find Nemo.Terrific underwater animation. Exceptional characters and a very talented ensemble providing voices. Brilliant colors and so casually pleasant on the eyes. Not many come along like this; especially with no off color or childish potty humor. Other characters are voiced by the likes of: Brad Garrett, Geoffrey Rush, Eric Bana, Elizabeth Perkins, William Defoe and Ellen DeGeneres.","

"evanston_dad","29 April 2005","""Finding Nemo"" finds the Pixar animation studio back in top form after their somewhat disappointing (I thought) ""Monsters, Inc."" This group has always had a knack for finding source material that will give them full freedom in unleashing their animation imaginations (the toy-chest world of ""Toy Story,"" the insect world of ""A Bug's Life,"") and in ""Finding Nemo"" they take us underwater and show us the beauty, wonder, and danger of the sea. There are any number of jaw-dropping set pieces in this film: a field of jellyfish, a shark attack, a mass escape from a fishing net. As usual, Disney fills its film with liberal messages about the treatment of wildlife and the environment, much welcome and needed messages in my opinion. But great animation alone cannot sell me on an animated movie--that's done with the quality of the story and characters, and ""Finding Nemo"" delivers there as well. The Pixar movies are never as cloying as the traditionally animated films produced by Disney--there's always a drier, cheekier brand of humour, and you get the feeling that just as many jokes are aimed at the adult audience as at the kids. The voices are terrific, the story is quick and funny, and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing. Grade: A","

Great action. Funny for both kids and adults. Really well animated.Like every Pixar movie it will get you emotional, maybe even make you cry.

"neil-476","5 April 2013","Clownfish Marlon is over-protective of son Nemo. Devastated when Nemo is caught by a fisherman, Marlon goes on a journey to rescue him, in the company of forgetful Dory.Finding Nemo is one of those Pixar films which was a revelation in terms of groundbreaking visuals coupled with real heart - Marlon's journey is not just a physical one, and all the characters have personal development arcs to match the very best of those enjoyed by real-life actors in live action movies. The underwater visuals are simply stunning, the script is packed with humour, action, excitement and emotion, and the voice work is great (with Ellen DeGeneres' delightfully loopy Dory stealing the honours). This film is as good now as it was on release.Sadly, I have to add that, yet again, Pixar's 3D retooling adds very little. I was expecting great things - the possibilities offered by those grand underwater vistas suggested very effective 3D, but much of the time the 3D reworking was barely noticeable.Still a great film, though.","

"CinemaSerf","9 June 2023","""Nemo"" is your typically adventurous and curious offspring. Living amidst the wonders of the Barrier Reef has began to wear on the young clownfish, though, and he yearns for the open ocean. His dad knows best and has forbidden him from leaving the safety of their home waters but one day his nose gets the better of him as he espies a fishing boat and next thing he is caught by a diver who whisks him off to the surgery of a dentist where he is deposited in a tank with some fellow prisoners - awaiting the arrival of the man's daughter who is to be the new owner of ""Nemo"". Now young as he is, he's not without nouse and is soon working on a plan to return to the open sea - which they can all see from the window! Meantime, pop ""Marlin"" is in a panic and in his search for his wayward son encounters ""Dory"" - a forgetful fish who thinks she's seen a boat, but then again... Loads of colourful and enjoyable escapades follow as the pair use ingenuity and take quite a few risks to become reunited. First things first - ""Dory"" just annoyed me. Right from the start I was hoping that she would become shark fodder. She has short term memory loss - but how does she remember that? Anyway, apart from that there are loads of endearing characters here from the vegetarian sharks, the loveable ""Peach"" and the characterisation of ""Nemo"" imbues him with an innocence and mischievousness that has to raise a smile - and even engender a bit of concern - as he seems destined for transit in the same plastic bags we all used to use for our goldfish back in the day. The animation is gorgeous and the clever soundtrack (there's even a bit of Herrmann's ""Psycho"" in here) adds loads to enrich this classy and charming adventure. It's really a big screen experience, if you can.","

"austinyoung-56965","23 April 2016","Pixar has done it again! That is a phrase we have become accustomed to hearing these past few years. Pixar Animation Studios has taken the children's movie industry by storm. Andrew Stanton takes us head first into the beautiful, strangely bewildering, world of the big blue ocean with Finding Nemo. We expected children to be captivated by this new installment of children's animation, but parents are also catching the wave as well. This isn't just some fish tale! Okay, well maybe it is. Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) is a paranoid, highly overprotective clown fish. His son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) is a young child full of energy, enthusiasm, with a dash a rebellion thrown in there. Nemo was left crippled at birth after an attack that took his mother and all of his siblings. This leaves NEmo with a deep desire to be independent. This is shown while on a school field trip. Nemo, trying to show off to some friends swims out into open waters. A pair of divers come from the darkness and kidnap Nemo. Marlin, with the help a newly found and hilariously forgetful friend Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) start the adventure to save the only thing that he has left in this world. Little did they know Marlin and Dory will run into all sorts of roadblocks along the way. They encounter sharks that have sworn off eating fish, a horrifying Angler Fish, a bale of sea turtles, and a forest of jellyfish. All of this just to track down his son. That's what I call being a good dad! Finding Nemo is the perfect mixture of a great story, witty comedy, and enticing animation. The bright colors of the underwater world are extravagant. The dialogue keeps viewers entertained and laughing. While the depth of the story of a father losing his son hooks them in for good. This tale is fit for all, young and old. When a child sits down to watch this movie, they can relate to Nemo. A young child looking to do his own thing and go on some adventures. Nemo grows along the course of the film. He goes from being a rebellious little punk, to someone who understands the importance of family and how much his father loves him. As Nemo grows, any child who watches him grows as well. This is one of many reasons why this is a fantastic movie for children. As Pixar will continue to reel in fantastic stories every year, Finding Nemo will go down as one of their greatest hits. Children and parents are flocking to this new spectacle. This thrilling tale will warm the hearts of fathers everywhere who care for their children. Although Marlin could be a little extreme at times, it was very clear that he would do anything for his Son. I believe I echo the words of everyone saying that we want more from Pixar.","

"Aaron1375","26 November 2005","This movie was a very family friendly and funny movie that both kids and adults can enjoy. Great voice work really makes this one, as both Albert Brooks and Ellen Degenerous do outstanding jobs with their characters. I especially enjoy Ellen's spacey character, that does not have to good of a memory, but is so cute in her delivery. I love the part where she takes her turn at the shark intervention. Great scenes everywhere as the father goes looking for his son Nemo who is captured and placed in an aquarium of a dentist. In the tank are some of the most neurotic fish ever, including one determined to escape the tank. They all band together when it is found out that Nemo is going to be given to the dentist's niece who lets just say isn't very good with handling fish. Nemo's father faces many perils in the quest for his son including jellyfish, a lantern fish, a whale, seagulls, and many other very funny perils. So watch this movie and enjoy as it is one of the better computer generated movies I have seen with great voice acting. I enjoyed almost every minute though the opening is a bit sad it makes up for it with great comedy...look for John Ratzenberg as a very funny school of fish and check the end where the flaw in the escape plan is obvious.","

"mfadayi","8 May 2016","""Finding Nemo"" is a story of a clown fish named Marlin losing his son Nemo. This movie is about friendship and how friends can help you accomplish the hardest things in life. ""Finding Nemo"" is story written and directed by Andrew Stanton, produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures in 2003. Finding Nemo is about a clown fish named Marlin looking for his captured son Nemo. In this journey, Marlin meets a blue tang fish named Dory. Dory is a fish that is suffering from memory loss, but she helps Marlin find Nemo. Both Marlin and Dory face great danger, and hard situations in this journey. Meanwhile, Nemo is trying really hard to find a way to get out of the dentist's fish tank and find his way to the open sea in search of his father. But it's not that easy when you have Darla the fish killer (the little girl with the braces). ""Finding Nemo"" is a great Animated Movie. The movie uses amazing shades and colors, great sound effects, and amazing camera angles. In the scene where the diver pops up in front of the screen is amazingly realistic, it makes the audience feel like they are the ones in the movie. It also makes the audience feel like they are the clown fish when a huge human face pops up in front of the camera; the audience would feel small and also panic like Nemo. The director of the movie (Andrew Stanton) did an amazingly great job at animating the movie and adding scenes that will make the audience feel what the characters are feeling.The theme of the movie is there throughout the whole movie, but the audience realizes it near the end of the movie. The theme of the movie is friendship, and Marlin was able to accomplish his goal when Dory helped him through all the danger they faced. Another place friendship was used was when Nemo was captured in the fish tank in the doctor's office, where Nemo's friends saved his life from getting flushed down the toilet.""Finding Nemo"" is one of the BEST animated movies Pixar Animation Studios made. I strongly recommend for everyone to watch this movie. This movie would make you feel like you are in the movie and not watching the movie.10/10","

"The_Void","6 October 2004","I'm not a big fan of animation. In fact, up until I saw Finding Nemo, I had never seen an animated film that I love. Now that I have seen it, however, that's all changed. With it's vivacious characters, sublime animation and wonderful voice acting; Finding Nemo is a winner all the way. The story follows a young clown fish who is, believe it or not, called Nemo. A shark killed Nemo's mother and siblings, and this has lead his father to be overprotective of his only son. This over-protectiveness leads to rebellion from Nemo - you know what kids are like - and no sooner has his dad told him not to go near the boat, is he tapping the bottom of it with his fin, getting caught by a diver and then being taken to a fish tank in a Sydney dentist's surgery. Of course, his dad isn't going to take this lying down and so begins an epic journey in which he risks life and fin (sorry) to, you guessed it, find Nemo.As mentioned, the animation in this film is absolutely wonderful. By far and away the best picture that Pixar have ever created, in terms of looks and finished item. The colour scheme for the movie is extremely vibrant, and is therefore aesthetically pleasing for the duration. The film also does a fantastic job of creating it's own world; the sea is a place that is busy and bursting with life. Throughout the film, our hero's are confronted with many challenges and inventive characters - from the sharks that want to stop eating fish, to the forest of jellyfish, down to the escape artist Gill (voiced to perfection by William Dafoe), Finding Nemo has no shortage of vivacity in it. The film is as impressive as far as substance goes, as it is on the visual front. The characters in Finding Nemo give the film a lot of it's substance and, aside from the fact that they're mostly talking fish, feel very real and almost have a life of their own. In an animated children's film, you don't expect to see characters the likes of what's on show here, but Finding Nemo delivers on the character front too. Our main hero's are great creations; we have Marlin, the father. He's very neurotic and wouldn't be out of place in a Woody Allen film (aside from the fact that he's a talking fish, obviously). His opposite number is a lovable, if forgetful female blue tang fish called Dory. Dory is a brilliant character, she is funny yet never irritating throughout the movie and it is somewhat because of her that the movie plays out so well. These two have a great chemistry on screen, which is better than a lot of the chemistries in 'serious' films. Nemo himself is your typical child  thinks he knows it all, but doesn't. And the film wins realism points for this too. There is a great menagerie for the support cast, which includes turtles, whales, sharks and much more; and all of them are brilliant examples of the kind of imagination that has gone into this film.There are also several life lessons on display in this film, and those are what lifts Finding Nemo from merely an animation film, to a film that can be respected by adults, as much as by children. The life lessons on offer are; listen to your parents, shown clearly by the fact that this whole fiasco is born of a result of Nemo disobeying his dad. There's also themes, on the other hand, of how overprotecting your children can lead to them viewing you with contempt; and the movie strikes a balance, like it does on the whole, between both sides of the parental structure. Aside from the family based messages, the film also has things to say that certain people and countries would do well to note; first of all, interfering with nature is not nice, and stemming from that is the message that if you have the power, it doesn't mean you have the right to use it; clearly portrayed by the diver that takes Nemo from his home. The fact that the film has all these themes, and still manages to be deliriously entertaining is testament to it's brilliance. Many films that profess substance don't have as much as this little caper does.Overall, animation doesn't get any better than this. Finding Nemo is fun for children, but there is MORE than enough for adults to enjoy, and I would have no qualms with recommending this movie to anyone.","

"snoozejonc","18 April 2022","A clownfish embarks on a journey to find his missing missing son.'Finding Nemo' is an excellent animated feature film.The plot is both character and adventure focussed with a number of memorable moments. Some standard Disney formula is applied, like the controlling parent, but it is a major part of several character arcs that works very well.For me the opening scene is brilliant and sets up the characters perfectly. Then splitting into two narratives cleverly puts as much emphasis on Nemo's personal journey as it does on Marlin's adventure.There are lots of fun scenes and characters throughout the movie. I think everything involving Gil, Crush, the seagulls, and the three sharks is classic Pixar. The character Dory, who is a big part of the movie, borders on annoying in some scenes, but not enough to spoil it. Comedy is in the eye of the beholder, so some people may find her hilarious.Visually it is awesome. The animators created an underwater world that looks realistic and is full of Disney's trademark anthropomorphic personality. The character design is flawless. I also love the sequence with the submarine and naval mines. Plus everything that happens in the fish tank is superb.The voice performances are excellent as always with Pixar. Albert Brooks leads it well and there are great contributions from the likes of Willem Dafoe, Geoffrey Rush, Andrew Stanton, Barry Humphreys, and others.","

"ElMaruecan82","17 July 2017","Disney movies have provided a fair share of lachrymose moments ever since Snow White's funeral, but in seven decades, two movies reached the trauma-inducing level: ""Bambi"" and ""The Lion King"" (no need to remind why). But while it took half a century to provide the second shocker, it was only one year shy away from a decade that the third one came, through the unsettling (yet powerful) opening of ""Finding Nemo"".The film starts with a clown-fish couple, Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Coral, they lovingly contemplate their new nest of love in the Great Barrier Reef where hundreds of little eggs are peacefully 'sleeping'. The heart-warming sight distracts us from the ominous arrival of a barracuda. And once Marlin realizes that the Reef is suddenly empty, you know whatever is coming will not be ""Fish Police"" material, not even ""The Little Mermaid"". Thankfully (so to speak) the scene is shot in 'subjective camera', Marlin is knocked out and after a brief blackout, the previously colorful and magnificent-looking Ocean from the opening credits turns into a devastatingly silent mortuary.Marlin lost his eggs but one, a little reddish bowl still beating from inside, a minuscule yet so priceless light of hope. Marlin calls the fish Nemo as the instant homage to his deceased wife who happened to like the name.You see, the mark of great movies is that you can tell from the first five minutes that you're onto something special. ""Finding Nemo"" left me no doubt that I was going to watch a something very special. I compared the opening to the deaths in ""Bambi"" and ""The Lion King"" but these were middle-plot points, establishing a necessary evolution in the main characters. In ""Finding Nemo"", the tragedy is the set-up, it cements the unconditional love between Marlin and his son, which is what the film is primarily about. Indeed, for all the dazzling visuals and the infinite waves of blue the movie bless our sights with, it's all in the father-and-son relationship.We might dislike over-protective parents, they act ridiculously and embarrass their children when they try to impress their schoolmates, but how can anyone blame Marlin after that first scene, especially since Nemo (because of his egg's fall) has a diminutive fin. Still, the merit of the script is to make us understand Nemo's actions as well, when he sneaks away during a school field trip to get close to a boat, we know it's not to prove something to his friends but just a sign of exasperation addressed to his father. When he's suddenly captured by a scuba diver, he immediately calls Marlin for his help and we can only witness Marlin's desperation and determination to find his little one.The adventure takes off, and takes us from one visual delight to a thrilling encounter. I never felt as hypnotically entranced by the sight of the undersea world on a screen since the days I played ""Donkey Kong Country"" (don't laugh, if you were a fan of the game, you'd understand). This is computer-generated imagery at its finest, using lights and colors in a way that floats between reality and imagery, when a school of moon-fish form a sad-faced Marlin, you know the animators don't let themselves enslaved by realism and when a tiny fishy reveals to be a giant whale, it's a creative twist on the ""are you short or far away?"" gag. No visual trick is spared for the sake of a great moment, and it goes as far as allowing us to explore the human world, from the fish' perspective.Poor Nemo finds himself in a dentist fish tank whose occupants, lead by Gill, a Moorish idol voiced by Willem Defoe, try to pull a 'Great Escape'. Oddly enough, it was the tank, not the ocean that inspired Andrew Stanton the idea of Nemo. As a kid, he saw the same ones at the dentist and assumed they tried to escape. When he discovered the clown-fish species, and their reluctance to live an anemone, he found the perfect material for a thrilling and emotional adventure.Still, given the emotional resonance of the plot, he made it a perfect vehicle for comedy; the dentist gags and the goofiness of the seagulls never fails to inspire a few chuckles, the groovy turtles, the vegetarian sharks whose leader is conveniently named Bruce steal the show, but the greatest thing about ""Finding Nemo"", as far as laughs go, is the creation of Dory. With Marlin and Nemo, she's the third guy on the podium, an adorable regal blue tang fish suffering from short-term memory loss. The writers always find a way to make her condition funny, critical and sad when seriousness is required, and her tandem with killjoy Marlin saved the film from being a ""Bambi"" in the water.And the fourth star is obviously the ocean, rendered with a majesty that outdates ""The Little Mermaid"" and 8 years after ""Toy Story"", ""Finding Nemo"" showed how far Disney magic can go, it's like water has always been part of Disney's milestones ever since Mickey's ""Steamboat Willie"". And the story has such a richness of its own, that it needed two climactic sequences, one involving the fish tank and incarnating the human stupidity at its finest through the character of a fish-torturing girl named Darla and a more dramatic one set in fishing grounds where the mass school of grouper try to get off a net. At the end of this powerful journey, both Marlin and Nemo learned a few lessons about their relationship.""Finding Nemo"" is the stuff great animated movies are made of: magnificent visuals, a powerful story and comedy with the jolly Dory. The film was the most recent inclusion in AFI's Top 10 animated movies and once you see it, it's hard to argue. ""Dreamworks"" tried with ""A Shark Tale"", but it couldn't play in the same league than one film that swims 20 000 leagues above.","

"sddavis63","12 October 2009","""Finding Nemo"" is a very well done movie for the whole family. Technically, it has the high quality of animation that Disney/Pixar are famous for, but what it also had was another feature Disney is famous for that hasn't always been clear in some of its more recent work - it's real, and at times sad and tragic, and doesn't get lost in the idea that children should somehow be shielded from the reality that sometimes bad things happen. In an opening that reminded me a bit of Bambi's mom being killed, when clownfish Marlin loses his mate Coral and most of his babies in an attack from a predator you knew that this was not going to be just a silly cartoon. In the aftermath of the attack, Marlin is left to raise his only surviving child Nemo by himself. Not surprisingly, he becomes over-protective, Nemo becomes resentful and in the end Nemo is captured by divers and ends up living in a tank in a dentist's office while his dad desperately tries to find him and rescue him. This runs the whole range of emotions - it's happy, it's sad, it's funny (the sharks who belong to the AA-type group - ""fish are friends, not food"" - are hilarious) and in its own way it's very educational for young ones, as the animation really does give them a sense of what some of these creatures look like. Ironically, probably the worst animation (at least in the sense of not looking anywhere close to real) was of the humans who periodically appear in the movie. Clearly, another winner for Disney/Pixar. 8/10","

"filipemanuelneto","26 June 2021","This film was one of those that marked a generation and consolidated the upward trajectory of Pixar, a studio that, for nearly ten years, had been threatening Disney's monopoly as the top studio in animated film. It wasn't the studio's first feature film to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Film (that honor belongs to ""Monsters Inc."", released two years earlier), but it was, in fact, the first to win the coveted award.The script is relatively simple: after several incidents, a clownfish that lives in the Great Barrier Reef in Australia leaves in search of his son, Nemo, who goes through several adventures and ends up being caught and placed in a home aquarium in Sydney. To succeed in his quest, the tireless father will rely on the unlikely help of another fish, Dory, a sea creature who really seems to have a loose screw in his head. The script was wonderfully developed and works very well, with a moving story full of emotional moments and adventure, being one of those movies that will please the whole family with ease. The characters were conceived with imagination, creativity and are really nice, they stay in the memory and capture our sympathy.The film is technically elegant and visually magnificent. To me, it was the most visually beautiful film that Pixar made in its initial period, and it still remains one of the most beautiful made by the studio to date. Colorful, with a vibrant range of colors and excellent contrast and saturation, the film is a sight to behold. The tight stroke, the relative realism of the animation (for the time it was impressive, but today there are clearly better and more advanced features), the way it was edited, all helped to make this film magnificent. The range of voice actors is good, and Ellen DeGeneres deserves all the applause for the inspired and committed way in which she lent her voice to Dory. Also noteworthy are the successful efforts of Albert Brooks, Willem Dafoe, Barry Humphries, Eric Bana and Andrew Stanton. The movie also has a good soundtrack and excellent sound effects.","

It's great, just like every other Pixar film. It's emotionally engaging, visually amazing, and the characters stay with you. The highlight is Dory, the fish whose voice is done by none other than Ellen Degeneres. Hopefully she never makes another animated voice again so this one is even more special because of that. The ending is pretty emotional, and the film tackles some important family themes that will hit hard. This is one of Pixar's best. Go see it for sure!","

Mind-blowing technology once again endears what could have been a silly cartoon into a cinematic marvel.

"tabuno","25 January 2019","9 June 2003. Like its predecessor ""Bambi,"" ""Finding Nemo"" represents one of the best examples of animation and one of the best movies I've seen. This movie uses advanced technological animation techniques to enhance a fine, entertaining script that contains solidly comic and dramatic dramatics to produce an excellent and vibrant motion picture experience. The standard for both animated movies and children's films has been raised significantly. Emotionally and aesthetically pleasing, this movie contains a combination of separate motion picture elements that are interwoven into a brilliant exciting almost mini-epic voyage of discovering in a waterworld that breaths of life. The cast of characters are imaginative, the emotional ties some temporary other permanent all have their counterpart in the real world. This movie surely deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.","

"Lady-of-Rohan","27 March 2005","I saw this film at a 9:40pm show about a good month after it's release date. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular but lo and behold Pixar completely blew me out of the water. Finding Nemo is a beautiful and gorgeous film about a clown fish desperate to look for his adventurous son, who has been captured from the ocean and put in a destist's office fish tank. The adventures along the way never stop Marlin's quest from being accomplished. It's a wonderful story on love, determination, and tenderness delivered with pure wit and magic. The film's visuals are Acadamy Award worthy. I went to Hawaii last Christmas and went snorkeling in a reef and I instantly thought of this film. Pixar animators captured the colour and life of a tropical reef wonderfully, alive with magic, and beauty. And not many films can do that. And the voices are top notch. Ellen Degeneres is side-splitting as the not-so-smart Dory. Other voices provided by Geoffrey Rush, William Dafoe, and Eric Bana are also nice touches.Whether you have children or you're a child at heart, Finding Nemo deserves to be bought and added to your DVD collection.","

The script is beautiful, very warm, funny and poignant - great for kids, perhaps even more so for adults, and, I can imagine, for parents.Overall, definitely an incredible feature, highly recommended anyone regardless of age!","

"Groverdox","3 March 2023","Although ""Finding Nemo"" isn't up there with the best of Pixar in my opinion, ie. ""Toy Story"", ""Toy Story 2"", ""A Bug's Life"", it's still pretty fantastic, and has most of the hallmarks of what makes Pixar so great.The movie has less pathos than the Toy Story franchise, but still has a couple of affecting moments, at the very beginning and very end.I was surprised to see Australia play such a role here. The only location on dry land in the movie is Sydney, namely its harbour and a dentistry. Also many of the characters are voiced by Australian actors, such as Eric Bana, Bill Hunter (R. I. P.), and the legendary Barry Humphries. I wonder why they chose Australia?Pixar probably does voice acting better than any other animation studio. Here, it's almost all great, with one unfortunate exception: Albert Brooks as Marlin, Nemo's neurotic dad. For the first time watching a Pixar movie I found myself annoyed by one of the voice actors, who kept taking me out of the movie. The character of Marlin needed to be less whiny and neurotic, not more so. Albert Brooks is known as the west-coast Woody Allen for a reason, and I don't think his voice and vocal mannerisms really suited the movie.Although she seems quite unpopular these days, Ellen DeGeneres's work as Dory, paired with Marlin to save Nemo, really ameliorates the harm done by Brooks to the movie's atmosphere. She also has most of the movie's laugh-out-loud moments.The other thing is that the movie is less of an adventure than you'd expect from a Pixar movie. There are only really two locations in it - the vast, featureless ocean, and a dentist's office. The ""adventure"" mostly comes from all the different sea-creatures the characters meet in both places (the dentist's office has a fish tank). And Nemo's escape from the fishtank is surprisingly not that visually interesting.I feel like I'm ragging on ""Finding Nemo"" too much. It's still got more than enough of that Pixar magic to make it a good time. It's a classic animated flick, just not up there with the best of its studio's output.","

"r96sk","22 July 2020","Utterly stunning.There isn't anything to dislike about 'Finding Nemo', it sets the tone perfectly and expertly tells the tale of Nemo, Marlin and Dory. Considering how the story goes, the film does an outstanding job at seamlessly switching between Nemo's adventure and his father's - it's truly terrifically done.This also includes a whole bunch of memorable characters and voices. Alexander Gould, Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres are the obvious stars as the early mentioned trio. There's a load of others though, with Willem Dafoe (Gill), Geoffrey Rush (Nigel) and Barry Humphries (Bruce) all giving excellent performances.The animation is superb, a few moments haven't aged as greatly but the absolute vast majority still looks unbelievable. The premise is funny, cute and heartwarming - as it keeps one's attention from start-to-finish. The score is fantastic, too.Highly recommended.","

"Vartiainen","4 January 2019","A morose and neurotic clownfish named Marlin is raising his son Nemo alone after a barracuda ate his wife and all the rest of his children. (Trust me, it's a family film.) But then Nemo gets taken by Man, that great monster from the above world. And so Marlin has to go and find him. And we have our movie.I remember seeing this film when it came out and thinking that Pixar had really upped their game. Monsters, Inc. looked nothing compared to this and it's only a couple years older. All the locations underwater are breathtakingly beautiful, even today. Bursting with colour and life, hiding all sorts little details, nooks and crannies. And the fishes look great as well. There's a subtle scale detail on Marlin and Nemo that you only see in close-ups, but it's that extra layer of detail that completely sells it.True, the human characters are still a bit wonky, but even they have improved a lot from Monsters, Inc.Unfortunately, what keeps this film from being one of Pixar's all time greats, is the fact that the characters are not as good as they have been up to this point. Marlin especially is an aggravating character with his constant whining and scaredy cat antics. Yes, it's understandable and sympathetic to a point, and he does learn, but it's played up just a bit too much.Nemo is also a bit underdeveloped, but luckily the film has good characters as well. Chief amongst them being Dory, who's a bit of a one-joke character, but somehow the design, the jokes themselves and the voice acting by Ellen DeGeneres make it work beautifully.Finding Nemo is quality entertainment, don't get me wrong. It only pales in comparison to other Pixar films, and even amongst them it's up there. Definitely worth a watch for kids and adults alike.","

"jzappa","18 May 2009","Andrew Stanton's rejuvenation of Pixar by deep-sea adventure is a joyous encouragement to expand one's experience and acumen of one's environment and inhabitance. Look at Marlin, Albert Brooks' clownfish protagonist. In the opening scene, his wife is eaten by a barracuda along with all of their eggs, except for one. Marlin finds that egg and promises it he will never leave it, naming it Nemo. His journey is a testament to the catharsis and philanthropic imposition of chaotic situations, ones that happen within the context of the natural pitfalls of one's existential habitat. Parallel to his titular quest for Nemo is Nemo's own quest for the sanctuary of his father, and so in the superconscious of this deep-sea adventure, opposite energies are negotiated. Marlin's principle of orderly civilization, maintained by fear and the haunting wounds of his loss, is converged with the reality of messy nature. Stanton's precept paints the natural world with a wildly natural brush.The Pixar films are the American vanguard's long-overdue equivalent of Japan's Ghibli Studios anime films by Miyazaki and Takahata. The reason is that they are creating a new standard for American family films, filtering out the complacence and tampered ideology of the contemporary cartoon-animated Disney films and the like. This has, naturally, been ignored in pertinence to this particular film: The film's prominent use of clownfish prompted mass purchase of the animal as pets in America, even though the movie portrays the use of fish as pets with strong negativity and saltwater aquariums as elaborately tricky and expensive to maintain. In Vanuatu, clownfish were being caught on a large scale for sale as pets, motivated by the demand.But I believe a lot of kids know better. A movie like Finding Nemo portrays nature not only as something to fear and not only as something to seek out, but both, enmeshed in a sort of way that applies to what these characters, Merlin, Nemo, a flighty little regal tang called Dory with Ellen DeGeneres' voice, learn about themselves. They are oppressed by the sea's natural peril, but transformed by experiencing the very nature of the sea.The film has its handful of cornier moments, bits of humor that are meant more for the clean minds of wholesome children and their mothers, but they do not detract any more than they may in one of Steven Spielberg's more fantastical films for younger audiences. It nonetheless assumes you are absorbed in its world rather than popping it into the VCR during a birthday party. It makes sense, it tells a thematically diverse story, it has lessons, and it's moving. But more than anything, it's fun.","

He lives in a coral reef with his Dad, Marlin. Sadly, Nemo's mother died before he was born. He was eaten by a shark. So Marlin is very over protective. When Marlin finally decided that Nemo could go to school, Nemo goes out of the reef, out into what they call ""The Drop"", which is the dangerous open sea. Nemo wanted to prove to his new friends that he wasn't scared. He goes and touches a boat, which the kids call a butt, very funny by the way, and he gets captured by scuba divers. Nemo then gets sold to a man who owns a dental clinic in Sydney, Australia. Nemo meets some new friends in the tank, and needs their help to get home to his Dad. Meanwhile, Marlin is going on a wild ride with new friend, Dory, who can't remember anything. They travel around the ocean in hopes of finding Nemo. Hence the title of the movie. Eventually, they find each other and it's a sweet and touching moment.Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10.","

"FiendishDramaturgy","25 December 2003","Finding Nemo was a sheer delight, comparable to Lilo and Stitch, but made more like Toy Story. Pixar has really accomplished a classic telling with this one.Nemo is a small clown fish who is the sole survivor of his clutch. His only living family is his father, as his mother was eaten while defending her clutch of eggs. As a result, his father is a complete almost non-functioning paranoid who would be happy to just live inside his anemone with his sun, and never venture out for anything.This, of course, does not set well with his son, who is your average, adventurous child in every way but one; he has a deformity which gives his paranoid father all the excuses he needs to closet his child and keep him from the world.Stolen from his father's loving and watchful eye by divers (probably American, one of the other fish proclaims) Nemo is taken into the world of humans and deposited inside an aquarium where he will be given as a present to Darla the Fish Killer.Meanwhile, his father races after the boat, loses the trail and must rely on the assistance of Dory, she of the short term memory loss. Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, literally steals the show with her dialog and lines which are hilariously funny. Marlin the clown fish hunts after his son for weeks, swimming hundreds of miles in search of his lost son.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who needs a good laugh, and a good shot of wholesome Disney. I was a bit taken aback by the anti-American line in this movie, considering it IS an American production AND Disney, to boot, but I suppose it is just Disney's little jibe at those who would blame America for everything, when it turns out an Australian was the one who stole Nemo, after all. *shrugs* I don't know, but it did not sit well with me. But it was just one line, and the rest of the movie was wonderful.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.","

"CubsandCulture","29 December 2020","The story of this film-about parental, guardian relationships-is strong Pixar material. There's obvious thematic flourishes-like how Gill is too lax, and Marlin is too protective or how Marlin learns to trust Nemo because of his friendship with Dory. As always the voice case is stellar; I legit think Degeneres (and the character lead animator) should have been nominated in best supporting actress at the Oscars, BAFTAs etc. And of course the film is very funny. But it stands out because of how lush the visuals are.Some of this is just the setting but the film fully captures the natural beauty of coral reefs and various ocean locales. You can freeze frame basically any shot and you have a breathtaking landscape. The visual splendor is so strong I fear it sometimes overwhelms the emotional core of the story. It is too easy to get lost in the visuals.","

Unfathomable sights, too, as the screen explodes with hypnotizing colors, impressive environs and staggering changes in scale. The ocean is a marvelous setting for such versatility, not to mention an unusually fresh one, and this team knows when/where to shine the spotlight. It's bright and vibrant like a kids' movie; lush and expansive as an unexplored frontier; sufficiently dangerous to transform any down beat into an opportunity for suspense. There's more than just superficial drama, too, with a deep human experience at its heart: the inner struggle between protecting one's children and allowing them to learn for themselves.Great voice acting all around, from Albert Brooks (the scarred, neurotic dad) to Ellen DeGeneres (comic relief with a side of simple compassion). Fantastic, playful screenwriting that's capable of exploring timeless, meaningful themes without losing the youngsters along the way. Gorgeous visual effects and cinematography, still (somehow) impressive after almost two decades. Finding Nemo does it all, standing tall as a cornerstone of the now-legendary early Pixar filmography.

"TheOneThatYouWanted","23 June 2016","This is Finding Nemo. That's all you have to know. In fact, I'm pretty sure everyone on earth has seen this movie. It is just one of those kind of movies. A touching tale about a little fish named Nemo who is taken by a human in front of his worrywart father, who transverses the ocean itself to find his little boy. I love everything about this movie. The beginning of the film isn't as big of a tear-jerker as some of the other Pixar films, and I think that helps the movie out because everyone and their dog remember the beginning of the movie Up just because of how powerful the first 5 minutes of it is. Finding Nemo on the other hand has perfect pacing. The story is awesome and the characters are great. Finding Nemo is still my all-time favorite Pixar movie to date.","

"rannynm","29 October 2012","Finding Nemo, the 2003 film that captured hearts and won the Best Animated Feature Oscar in 2004, has gotten a studio makeover and has been filling movie theaters in its 3-D version. This is a perfect film for you to share with your youngest grandchildren although you should be aware that there are some frightening scenes that 2 and 3-year-olds may find disconcerting. Here is what our KIDS FIRST! Film Critics had to share about the film: ""I thought the 3-D was cool,"" says KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Anthony Aranda, age 10, who goes on to say there wasn't enough of it: "" but they needed to add more 3-D parts to the movie."" Fellow youth film critic Cheyenne Nguyen, age 8, was captivated by the cinematography and visual effects, sharing, ""The clear and crisp color with 3-D is magical. It feels like I am snorkeling and ready to touch these sea creatures."" Morgan Bertsch, age 7, thought that the 3-D makes all the characters really come to life. ""It was amazing. It made you feel like you were really in the ocean. Just keep swimming, just keep swimming."" The father's long journey from the safety of his coral reef home through the vastness of the ocean to where Nemo had been taken in Australia is fraught with danger and even earns him fame among the other creatures of the sea. He gains a sidekick early on his quest whose short-term memory loss balances the mood with heavy doses of humor. Finding Nemo 3D Reviewed by Cheyenne Nguyen and Morgan Bertsch See their full review on video. http://www.youtube.com/watch? v=XRhQ87qMeh0 Watching Finding Nemo 3D by Disney-Pixar is like you are snorkeling and looking through your goggles and enjoying the colorful fish and sea life. This story is about Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), an overprotective father of Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould), a clown fish with a defective fin. It all starts with Coral and Marlin, Nemo's mom and dad looking at all 400 eggs and trying to determine names for each of the eggs. Suddenly, a barracuda comes to the coral and knocks Marlin unconscious. When Marlin wakes up, the reef is empty; with no fish around, the only egg left under the coral is Nemo. Marlin becomes a very protective dad and will not let Nemo out of his sight. However, Nemo is the opposite of his dad. He always wants to swim into the unknown. On the first day of school, Nemo wanders off outside the reef and is captured by a dentist. This starts Marlin's journey to find his son. He swims as fast as he can and asks for help finding Nemo. The only fish that stops to help Marlin is Dory (voice by Ellen DeGeneres). Dory has a big heart and always positive. The only problem is she has short- term memory loss. The story line is the father and son love, unpredictable and very funny. There are so many punch lines in this movie that will keep you laughing throughout the movie. The clear and crisp color with 3-D is magical. It feels like I am snorkeling and ready to touch these sea creatures. I can see the layers of rainbow coral reef, several rows of teeth in the mouth of Bruce the shark, the pelican's beak, and jellyfish seem so soft and real. The best 3-D part is with the whale and the krill swimming toward the audience. I love how production and design make Dory velvety, Marlin and Nemo soft and gummy. The rest of the fish are metallic, typical scaly fish. This makes Dory, Marlin and Nemo more lovable. The sound effects of water sloshing and crashing are very realistic. The only part I did not like is what happens to Nemo's mom. Will Disney come back with Nemo reunited with his mom? The lessons in this movie are Marlin deals with his fear and swims all the way to Australia to find his son, Nemo, and he learns to have faith. My favorite character is Dory with her big heart and Crush the laid-back father turtle and his children. The message of this movie is listens to your parents — they only try to protect you and give you good advice. Parents are alive longer so they know a lot more than their children. I rank this movie five out of five stars. I give this film an age range of 3 and up.","

"noralee","22 December 2005","""Finding Nemo"" is a complete joy! It shows the value of using character actors for voices, rather than bimbos and himbos whose faces you can't see anyway. Not only wonderful are Albert Brooks as a worry wart dad (that's not a fish species) and Ellen DeGeneres (whose character is clearly inspired by Ani Di Franco's song ""Little Plastic Castle"": ""They say goldfish have no memory/I guess their lives are much like mine/and the little plastic castle/is a surprise every time/and it's hard to say if they're happy/but they don't seem much to mind.""), but we get to hear real Australian accents via Geoffrey Rush and Eric Bana. Phil Procter (of Firesign Theater) was listed as one of the many ancillary voices -- my husband commented that he could have done all the voices.The side characters are more than charming -- surfer dude tortoises, 12-stepping sharks and dynamic interactions in a prison, er, aquarium. The references to old movies are very funny, including ""The Birds"" and ""Psycho"" (with credited use of that screechy music).As a dentist's daughter, though, I do protest the stereotypes about pain and tooth-pulling. And why do all Disney movies have to have a dead parent? But at least we didn't have to suffer through the usual schmaltzy ballads as surprisingly this isn't a musical. It's worth staying for all the credits as the amusing animation continues to the very end. Though the jokes should appeal to all ages, the toddler running loose in our theater was probably too young, until a character on screen shouted out ""You there, stop!"" and she did, mesmerized wide-mouthed that the movie was talking to her, giving her mother time to catch her and take her outside.(originally written 6/15/2003)","

"davispittman","9 April 2017","Finding Nemo is hands down one of my favorite films of all time, and it's not just one of my favorite animated films, but it's one of my favorite films period. The first thing I'd like to cover is the perfect casting for the voices of the characters. Ellen DeGeneres is so perfect to play Dory. Her voice fits the forgetful fish so well! And it works well in the comedic scenes because Ellen is an accomplished comedian, so it makes scenes like speaking in whale hilarious. Albert Brooks is a good fit to voice marlin the clownfish, fits the overprotective nervous single father role well. And the script has such great skillful writing that it gives the characters hilarious lines when it's supposed to be funny, and sentimental/touching when the moment calls for it. The screenplay really did deserve an academy award nomination. The dialogue really gets deep with the character development. It's not just silliness, the movie really focuses on not only the father-son relationship between marlin and Nemo, but also on Dory and her being alone in life and finding solace and peace in the newfound friendship with both marlin and nemo. Animated movies that will please both children and adults like this one is sure to. It's got a little something in it for everyone to enjoy. It's hard for me to believe that there's people out there who still to this day have not seen finding nemo, but I'm sure they're out there, and if you're one of them, go fix this problem! See this great animated classic! 10/10!","

There's also a lot of drama imvolved, which makes it slightly more serious than most other animated films. If you love animated or adventure films, you'll probably love this.","

"ShootingShark","25 January 2008","Nemo is a young clownfish who gets caught by a scuba-diver and taken to Sydney. His father, Marlon, with the aid of a forgetful Regal Tang called Dory, must conquer his fears and set out on a dangerous quest across the Great Barrier Reef to rescue his son.Although the storyline may be a little reminiscent of other animated features (Pinnochio, Bambi), this is a charming, visually entrancing fable of piscatorial adventures. It's a little too safe for me - you know Marlon is going to find Nemo and nobody cute is gonna die - but the characters are funny and richly observed and it has enough wacky off-the-wall stuff to keep us chuckling, like the Sharks Anonymous meeting, the fishy notes on dental techniques and the moronic seagulls constantly blabbering, ""Mine !"". Its real strength however is in the imagery; the blues and oranges just leap off the screen as swathes of primary colours and the ocean is simply alive with movement, currents, ripples, bubbles and clouds. Scenes like the jellyfish sequence or the struggle inside the whale are astonishing in their design and visual clarity, and there are some great monster shots, like the barracuda at the start or the anglerfish which nearly eats Marlon. The voice cast of the movie are good, particularly Dafoe as Gill, the slightly-sinister-yet-noble angelfish and Humphries as a crazy shark called Bruce, and the theme of giving children the space to grow is a moving one. Whilst not quite as hip as Shark Tale (made around the same time), this is nevertheless a touching, funny, beautifully animated fable and won an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. Produced by John Lasseter's Pixar Animation Studios, and dedicated to one of its key animators, Glenn McQueen, who died of cancer in 2002.","

"rosscinema","7 June 2004","Pixar has created something quite special with this film and I do believe that this deserves to be mention with the best of them although ""Pinocchio"" is still the king. Story takes place on a coral reef in the ocean off of Sidney, Australia where we find a clown fish named Marlin (Albert Brooks) who is always worrying about his son Nemo (Alexander Gould) because he was born with one extra small fin. One day Marlin's worries come true when Nemo is captured by scuba divers and taken away in a boat. Marlin tries to find his son by following the trail of bubbles but they quickly disappear and now he must find another way. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Marlin meets Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who is a female and blue and also suffers from short term memory loss but she tags along with Marlin to help find his son. Meanwhile, Nemo has landed in a fish tank in a dentist office and he meets Gill (Willem Dafoe) who is a scarred gill fish and he has elaborate plans of escaping the tank and making it to a drain which leads to the ocean. Marlin and Dory while on their trek encounter sharks, poisonous jelly fish, sea turtles, and get swallowed by a whale but manage to escape through the blow hole. They get to the harbor by Sidney and with the help from a pelican they get to the office and see Nemo!This film is co-directed by Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich and Stanton has become a very important director for Pixar. Three things stand out from this film for me and the first is the story that Stanton wrote himself. The journey that Marlin and Dory take to find Nemo is seemingly impossible but with the creative story it does manage to happen and it's a lot of fun to watch. Secondly, rarely has a voice in animated features stood out but what DeGeneres accomplishes here is nothing short of memorable. Her voice not only possesses humor but it also makes the audience feel sorrow and pity for Dory and she gives this animated character a new dimension. How can anyone not laugh when she talks whale and all it's dialects? Thirdly and not the least is the jaw dropping animation that is created for this film and the intricate details that take place are nothing short of brilliant. From the school of swerving jelly fish to the slow emergence of the whale from the darkness this film gives animation a depth and dimension that I'm not sure we have seen before, at least not like this! This is a rare visual delight that belongs to be mentioned with the other classic animated features.","

"valadas","25 February 2004","These more or less anthropomorphic cartoon movies in which animals behave like human beings can convey strong moral messages while at same time amusing your kids a lot. Therefore it's very appropriate to take them along with you. On the other hand they can also feature animals (or some species) as friendly creatures ready to love and be loved and prone to tribulation sometimes too. In this concrete case we have an animal species not very often portrayed: fish. Which can also be nice and attractive like any other animals. I remember now ""Bugs"" another movie featuring a much less attractive species and which was also a good one. If you can make bugs appear as nice beings you can make it with any other kind of animals. Nowadays those movies are all made with the help of computers which makes them much easier to make without by saying this, belittling the directors and other technicians' talents. In this movie fatherly love is the main theme and you can draw the following maxim from the story: kids must obey their parents to avoid getting into trouble. A last word to the images and visual effects. Yes they are beautiful visions of underwater seascape and of the sea bottom, full of colour and fantasy. In conclusion I can say that I've seen better cartoon movies but also some not so good therefore the final conclusion is largely positive.","

"Rob_Taylor","1 October 2003","Disney has been a very hit or miss affair recently. The appalling Jungle Book 2 is best forgotten, whilst such delights as Lilo and Stitch and The Emperor's New Groove are to be praised. Finding Nemo falls squarely in the thumbs up zone, so it would seem that the mouse-house is finding its feet again.FN is quite an eye-fest. The animation teams have captured the underwater world with astonishing realism, though the fish characters are, as might be expected, a little bit cartoony. On the whole, though, an amazing piece of technical work.The story is simple and there are plenty of action scenes and sight gags to keep the kids happy. At the same time there are enough adult gags thrown in to keep parents amused and entertained too. There's even a Star Trek reference in the form of the ""Nexus"" (watch it and see!)If I only have one criticism to level at the movie it is this (spoiler!).....After having rescued Nemo, both father and son appear to completely forget about the fish in the dentist's tank and return to their own idyllic existence. There is a short final sequence showing the fish escaping from the tank by themselves, but you'd have thought that Nemo and Marlin would have wanted to at least try and help. A bit puzzling that one, and disappointing in a film that clearly espouses values such as loyalty and friendship. Perhaps I missed something, but that bit messed up an otherwise excellent film.All in all though, great fun for the kids and entertaining for adults too.","

"rdoyle29","11 September 2003","Stanton, who helped write ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc."", co-wrote and directed this computer-animated comedy-adventure about finding a very small fish in a very large ocean. Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) is a more-than-slightly paranoid Clown Fish who is extremely devoted to his young son, Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould). Nemo is the only survivor after a hungry barracuda swallowed up Nemo's mother and her other offspring. It's not Marlin's nature to explore unfamiliar waters, but when Nemo is captured by a diver near the Great Barrier Reef and ends up in a dentist's fish tank, Marlin gathers his courage and sets out to find his son. As Marlin searches for his son, he makes friends with a friendly but absent-minded Regal Blue Tang named Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), a Great White Shark named Bruce (voice of Barry Humphries) who is trying to cut fish out of his diet, a beach-rat Sea Tortoise named Crush (voice of Stanton), and Nigel (voice of Geoffrey Rush), a Pelican who can take Marlin's search from the ocean to dry land. ""Finding Nemo""'s impressive voice cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Allison Janney, Eric Bana, Stephen Root, Brad Garrett, and Bruce Spence. 	""Finding Nemo"" is a superb achievement on three distinct levels. First, the look of the film is gorgeous. The Pixar crew has created a fully realized underwater world. The colors are bright and entrancing, while the movement of the fish is so realistic that the viewer never for a second suspends disbelief. The story is beautifully structured. After establishing the relationship between Marlin and Nemo, the film sets up the separate worlds they each inhabit (the ocean and the fish tank). The screenwriters have dreamed up creative plot points, formulating exciting obstacles (like the wrecking of a filtration system, a dangerous jellyfish zone, and a fish-killing eight-year-old) that allow the film to maintain an exciting pace without sacrificing character or humor. Each member of the cast appears to have been hired for their skills as a performer more than for their name recognition. Brooks, DeGeneres, and Dafoe all communicate real emotional truth in their characters, while such talented vocal performers as Root, Rush, and Humphries lend pitch-perfect comedic support. ""Finding Nemo"" is an inventively written, gorgeously drawn, and perfectly acted animated film.","

"djansen24","13 November 2010","I think what separates Pixar from any other animation studio is that all of the action, technical effects, and dialog serves to connect the audience with the characters. It is not just thrown in for the sake of itself. And therefore they make razor tight stories heart touching and effortless. Finding Nemo is the first absolute masterpiece from Pixar. While the other films have been excellent, this one set a new standard for them. The color palette in the ocean murkiness is fabulous and makes us feel a part of the world we are in. The characters are wonderful. Whether they are on for a moment or throughout the entire movie, you care for them. Yes, they kind of hit you over the head with a message here and there, but that in no way distracts from the enchantment and thrill of this movie. I should call it a fable, because it plays out that way. The basic overriding theme is getting father and son back together. And this is one story all ages can relate to. Who hasn't in their lifetime gotten ""lost"" for a brief moment from their parents? The theme resonates deep with us. The fact that it plays out with technical mastery, bedazzling scenes, flat out hilarious humor, and thrilling action is just icing on the cake. Pixar landed a good story and told it 100% right! A must see!A Note: A couple of scenes are very scary for little little kids. Wait till they are maybe 5 or so before they see it.","

"slymusic","9 March 2006","""Finding Nemo"" is a superb motion picture created at Pixar Animation Studios. Make no mistake about it; this movie boasts quite an exciting adventure story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. That's how wonderful it is! (If you have not yet seen this movie, please do not read the next few paragraphs.) The story is about a clown fish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), whose son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) is snatched away by scuba divers. Marlin meets a friendly, energetic, completely absent-minded blue tang fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), and together they go on a frantic yet thrilling search for Nemo, all the while meeting a host of friendly & unfriendly characters and risking their lives time and again. Over the course of the movie, Nemo learns to believe in himself and his own strength, and Marlin learns, after going on such a long journey all across the vast ocean, to not be so overprotective of his son. In the end, Marlin tells Nemo to ""go have an adventure."" The following are my favorite highlights from ""Finding Nemo."" Marlin and Dory create a game out of dodging an overwhelming crowd of jellyfish. When the French cleaner shrimp Jacques (voiced by Joe Ranft) spins Nemo around in the fish tank, the accompanying accordion music, typifying the Parisian atmospheres, makes this scene that much funnier. There is much commotion in the dentist's office when the helpful pelican Nigel (voiced by Geoffrey Rush) bursts in and distracts both the dentist (voiced by Bill Hunter) and his freakish niece Darla (voiced by LuLu Ebeling) in order to save Nemo from an early demise. The end credits involve practically all of the main marine characters engaging in some funny antics, and the catchy tune ""Beyond the Sea"" was an excellent choice of musical accompaniment. No sooner do Marlin and Nemo reunite at the end when a huge net swoops onto a massive school of fish, including Dory, and father & son take on a suspenseful moment by coaxing all the fish to swim downward together. There is a wonderful chase sequence, which is actually more hilarious than dangerous, involving Marlin and Dory against a gigantic Austrailian shark named Bruce (voiced by Barry Humphries), who is initially tame until his uproariously funny moment of smelling blood oozing from Dory's snout; equally hilarious are Bruce's two cronies' attempts to console Marlin and Dory through the torpedo chamber. Nemo almost gets himself killed in the tank when he tries to prove his courage, thanks to Gill (voiced by Willem Dafoe), by stopping the motor in the tank filter. And finally, Mr. Ray (voiced by co-writer Bob Peterson), who is one of my favorite characters in the movie, is quite amusing as a schoolteacher who is overly enthusiastic about his subject matter, especially when he's singing while taking his students on a field trip.""Finding Nemo"" is a surefire winner that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It's quite obvious that the entire team at Pixar put a tremendous amount of effort into making this picture. Executive producer John Lasseter admitted that he knew ""Finding Nemo"" was going to be a smash hit even during its darkest days of production, and he was absolutely right!","

Dad has to cross miles of sea with new friend Dory in tow, while son finds himself part of an aquarium mini-culture devoted to escape. Although he overplays a tad Brooks is right as worrisome father and DeGeneres is spot-on as forgetful Dory. There are portions of this movie that are as inspired as any Disney entry, including the Dory character, the aquarium scenes and the EAC turtles. But I found some other parts tired or forced (particularly the sharks), and generally feel like they were working too hard to pad this out to a 100 minute running time.

"PCC0921","26 April 2022","I have always liked this movie, so much so, that myself and my friends, once set up a white bed sheet on a tennis court fence and watched the film outside, with friends and family on a video projector. I also went back to the movie theaters, when Disney re-released the film in 3D, for the 10th anniversary celebration. It shows this film is awesome on all platforms. Ellen DeGeneres had a busy year in 2003. On top of beginning her long running daytime talk show that year, she also was cast as the voice of Dory for this fantastic CGI animated film from Pixar Animation Studios. Her contribution to the film is excellent and she gives her character a great voice. A voice that would return again in the sequel, Finding Dory (2016). This would be Pixar's fifth film for Walt Disney Productions and Finding Nemo (2003), is so good it almost rivals their classic film, Toy Story (1995), almost. It's modern animation at its best.It's the story of a young clownfish, Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould), who gets separated from his family and his attempts to get back home. His father, Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks), goes out on a search to find him. Along the way, both Marlin and Nemo befriend other creatures of the sea, in order to complete their tasks. Many colorful, humorous, creatively conceived characters come into their paths, such as, a pelican, Nigel (Geoffrey Rush), Bubbles, a yellow tang fish (Stephen Root) and Gill, a disfigured moorish idol fish (Willem Dafoe), just to name a few. This animated adventure takes us all the way across the expansive ocean, as the search for the missing Nemo continues. There also is a separate plotline involving a group of fish, that Nemo gets trapped with, in a fish tank, that sits in a dentists office in Sydney, Australia. It's not a horrible place for Nemo, but his fate from this point on could be worse, as the dentist's daughter is a little monster. It's at this point, that we really begin to fear the danger that Nemo faces. It's a fantastic movie and one that works well entertaining people of all ages.","

They even managed to make Ellen Degeneres genuinely likable for the better part of two hours.(And if you're a Dad the last few minutes might have you tearing up.) What you hope kids will learn: For God's sake listen to your parents every now and then.

How the screenwriter brings each species' characteristics into his or her character. For example, jellyfish having poison and anglerfish leaving in the deep sea and tempting small fishes with the light greatly affect Marlin's adventure. In small scale, octopus shooting ink when scared and vegetarian shark relapsing after smelling blood are fun laughs.","

The film has many fantastic performances, mostly by Ellen Degeneres as dory, a fish with short term memory loss. I feel her pain. I don't have short term memory loss, but my memory is crap. Finding Nemo is an animation film that will either amuse some, or blow most others away. I saw the film when i was younger, and thought it was boring. But i've seen it quite a few times now and I realize how great it is. Finding Nemo is animated gold that has an eyeful of effects surely to blow you away. as I said, this isn't my favorite animation film, but it's tied with Shrek for second. Finding Nemo is an adorable film that everyone will love. I am sure you will. It's a fantastic film.The Plot: A clown fish named Marlon's son is taken by Australians.

"areatw","26 October 2019","I have fond memories of watching this film at the cinema as a kid and enjoying every minute of it. The story, the characters, the vibrant animation - I loved everything about it. The reason 'Finding Nemo' was such a success is that it appeals to all age groups, the story and visuals are something everybody can enjoy and the humour is clearly intended to appeal to adults as well as kids.Pixar created something special when they created 'Finding Nemo' and still to this day it remains one of their best. The word 'timeless' comes to mind as I think, even with the rapid advanced in CGI and animation, this will always be a classic family movie that people will continue to revisit. 'Finding Nemo' is not just a great kids/family movie, but a great movie full stop.","

"Beta_Gallinger","30 May 2008","As I'm sure you know, Pixar made their feature-length debut with ""Toy Story"", which turned out to be a huge hit, and without a doubt, they've made a good number of other massively successful movies since then. I went to see a good bunch of films on the silver screen back in 2003, probably more than I ever had in a year before or in any year since, but unfortunately, ""Finding Nemo"" wasn't one of them. However, I first saw the Pixar hit on DVD in early 2004, and was very impressed! I've seen it more than once since then, and it seems to hold up well.Marlin and his wife, Coral, are two clown fish who are about to become parents. Sadly, however, a predator soon comes, before their young are born, and knocks Marlin unconscious! When he awakens, he soon discovers that he is now a widower, and only one egg has survived the attack! Marlin names his one surviving offspring Nemo. When Nemo gets older, he starts his first day of school, but not long after he starts, he is caught by a scuba diver and taken away to a fish tank in a dentist's office by a harbour in Sydney, Australia! So, Marlin bravely sets out through the oceans to try and find his son, and soon meets a blue tang named Dory, who suffers from short term memory loss. She joins him on his adventure, and together, they face the dangers of the ocean as they try to make their way to Sydney! Meanwhile, Nemo and the other fish in the tank make plans to somehow escape, before the young clown fish is given to a rough little girl as a present the next time she comes for a check-up! Some of the humour in this Pixar effort may be more for kids than adults, but this isn't usually the case. There's a lot to amuse adults as well. The last time I watched this film, I found some laughs around the beginning, but wanted more, which was eventually what I got, I think starting with the part where Dory, voiced by comedienne Ellen DeGeneres, comes in, as she is a memorably humorous character. There are other characters who add humour as well, including the seagulls, who say ""Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!"" when they see creatures they want to eat, as well as certain fish in the tank with Nemo, and certain creatures Marlon and Dory meet on their adventure, such as the sharks. Speaking of characters, that's another upside to this film, the characters are usually likable, whether they're funny or not. Another merit is definitely the very colourful and 3-D animation! Last but not least, it's a good story, with a fair amount of excitement, as well as slightly touching moments.While ""Finding Nemo"" may not be a perfect family film, I would say it definitely comes close, so it's no surprise that it turned out to be such a big hit! It seems Pixar really knows how to appeal to kids and adults alike, and this effort of theirs does not hide that! The film wasn't around when I was a kid (I was a teenager when it came out), so I'll never know what it's like to see it during childhood, but since it's not strictly for kids, I wasn't too late. Probably for computer animation fans of all ages, there's lot to like, including the things I've mentioned above, as well as maybe other merits which I've failed to mention, though I'm sure others have pointed them out already.","

"JayWolfgramm","1 June 2023","""Finding Nemo"" is a 2003 Pixar Animated film about a clown fish named Marlin trying to rescue his son Nemo. When it came out it was one of the highest grossing animated films of all time, making over 840 million dollars at the box office. On top of that, it was a critical darling, being nominated for 4 Academy Awards. What do I think of the movie? Yeah, it is really that good.I watched this film when it first came out as a 12-year old, and I enjoyed the film. I thought it was funny and at times heat-warming. Since then, I have gotten the opportunity to re-watch this movie quite a bit. It was my nephew's favorite movie, so he would want to watch it a lot. At school it was a go to movie for the substitute to put on to entertain the students. In total, I have seen this movie over 20 times in my life. And upon these numerous viewings I have grown to appreciate the beautiful details the story tellers at Pixar have put together.This is a very tightly told story. Every bit of dialogue moves the story forward, reveal something about the character, foreshadows something to come or gives a good joke, sometimes it does all of this at once. This is an impressive feat considering that one of the main gimmicks of a main character is how forgetful she is. You would think that would mean that they have to repeat a lot of the same information again. But, no, the team use her in very clever ways throughout the whole runtime.The set ups and pay offs they have in this movie are things that film classes should be studying. They are able to convey a message that kids can understand, while at the same time not coming across as preachy or heavy handed. The ending when all the story beats come together is clever, intense and funny all at the same time. Speaking of the ending, the beginning is also one of the best cold opens to any movie. An absolute gut punch right out of the gates.The animation is beautiful, all the emotional beats work, the characters grow in believable ways and it is an enjoyable ride from beginning to end. I highly recommend watching it, you don't have to watch it 20 times to realize that this is fish movie is gold.","

"stamper","20 November 2004","While Nemo certainly entertains it is in no way a classic. In fact, disregarding 'A Bugs Life' I think it is the worst collaboration between Pixar and Disney. While watching the film, I felt that the emotional depth of the events could have been explored a lot more and I also felt that the film was not as funny as other animated films I've seen. To be honest, I felt that there wasn't that much magic around this time. I found Dory to be the most annoying fish ever (I can safely say that she wasn't funny 5 % of the time and annoying 95%) and frankly I felt that the other characters weren't too good either. I mean I liked Nemo and Gill and I thought everything with Crush in it was pretty cool, but in the end I felt that the majority of the characters just were NOT likable and cute enough. Also the film seemed to suffer from the lack of a true villain. All in all, this is an entertaining film, your kids will truly enjoy, but as far as adults are concerned, this one might have fared better if there would have been more magic, better characters and maybe even a shorter running time. Not the MUST-SEE it is made out to be and certainly not one of Disney's best. Well certainly it won an Oscar, but hey, when was the last time THAT meant something, not to mention that from what I've heard there wasn't much competition (as in ""the other 2!!! films had even less quality).7 out of 10 post scriptum: I rented the 2-DVD set and must say that the animated short ""Exploring the Reef"" is even worse than Finding Nemo itself (a small 6 out of 10), thus making the animated short ""Knick Knack"" (bigger 7 out of 10 than NEMO) from 1989 the best thing (in more than one way) on the 2 discs","

"obrofta","21 October 2006","What a delightful film. It's difficult to crack a top ten list, which hasn't changed in seven years (since Dances with Wolves), but this movie gets in my top ten. Ellen Degeneres' Dory creates her own chemistry with the sea and all the characters with whom she interacts. Yes, there is a special spark between Dory and Nemo's protective father fish, voice by Albert Brooks. Degeneres character would test the most stodgy and stoic of audiences. Who could mot crack a smile under Dory's amazing repertoire of forgetfulness and forget-me-nots? Who knew Nigel (Pelican from down under) was voiced by Geoffrey Rush? I think we are all still throwing in our own ""mine, mine..."", whenever we find the opportunity. All the way to the end and beyond (don't forget to watch the credits!)it's a story of adventure, heroism and love. Even if you think you a have an aversion to animated features, I double dog dare you to watch this movie, and try NOT to crack a smile. Nemo will wear you out with laughter, and make your heart grow fonder. Even if you thought you didn't have one (a heart that is).","

"anselmdaniel","8 June 2019","This review contains spoilers'Finding Nemo' is a computer-animated movie that premiered in 2003. The movie is produced by Pixar Animation Studios. The movie is directed by Andrew Stanton. The story is also written by Andrew Stanton. The screenplay is by Andrew Stanton, Bob Peterson, and David Reynolds. The movie stars the voices of Albert Books, Ellen DeGeneres, and Alexander Gould. The movie is about a clownfish father that searches for his son Nemo.Finding Nemo is a great animated movie for all audiences. This movie successfully blends humor for adults and children across its entire running time. There are so many great jokes and moments that will appeal to adults and children alike. This movie seamlessly transitions the plot and the writing to appeal to both of the audiences. This is still a rated G movie, but I am impressed with how much the movie could have moments that engage adults.The three stars in this movie do a fantastic job. Albert Books as the overprotective clownfish father and Ellen DeGeneres as a forgetful Dory make for a great duo as they set out to look for Nemo. Alexander Gould as Nemo has great moments especially once he reaches the dentist tank. The cast do a great job and it shows on the screen. Even if they are animated on the screen, their voices have great emotion.This movie does not have any villains. Any antagonist in this movie simply misunderstands the situation that the fish are in. This leads into situations where I cannot say that the movie fails to engage despite a lack of a villain. The obstacles that Marvin and Dory find themselves in are caused by the adventure and not a villain seeking to undermine them. It made for a stronger story overall as the characters tried to work together rather than be antagonistic to Marvin, Dory, or Nemo.The animation in this movie still holds up today in 2019. Even if the visuals are dated, I did not feel this detracted from the experience much. The main appeal is the plot and character. The visuals are more of a nice addition. There are still grand sequences in this movie like the current ride.I would recommend 'Finding Nemo.' This is an excellent animated movie for all audiences.Grade: A","

"juliankennedy23","18 May 2005","Finding Nemo: 6/10: As a kid's movie Finding Nemo is great. If somehow your munchkins don't already own a copy, have the toys or God forbid seen the ice show (there is something about fish on ice that's a bit creepy. Funny but creepy.) Feel free to buy a copy. You'll get your moneys worth, as the little animatrons will undoubtedly view it endlessly.But as an adult with no little minds of my own to feed the movie left me wanting. For one thing I've seen it before... about a hundred times before. Parent loses kid, kid loses dog, dog loses family, family loses toy, and so forth. Then the endless journey filled with danger, setbacks and endless comic relief characters begins. Finding Nemo, at least narratively, doesn't bring anything new to the party. The fact that Pixar themselves are guilty of using this exact same plot in all their movies doesn't help matters. (Pixar's next feature The Incredibles would actually break this trend somewhat and is the most adult friendly toon of theirs to date) The simple fact is after being spoiled by Shrek (or even Ice Age) I like my kids films to be more accommodating to adults. Not that some things don't work very well indeed (Bruce the 12 step shark and the ""mine, mine, mine,"" seagulls are particularly effective). It's just that the whole film had a cloying sentimentality I usually associate with NBC Olympic coverage or a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie about a Depression Christmas.That said kids will love it. The animation is spectacular. And as these things go it certainly is very well done. Just not my cup of tea I guess. I prefer my fish with a little more bite and lemon and butter.","

"Animany94","30 July 2018","Finding Nemo is yet another creative idea filled with memorable characters in a touching story about trust, family, teamwork and all the good stuff. No character without memorability or a reason for doing what they do. Nwemo's father, Marlin, is overprotective, but since Nemo is his only son after a tragic loss at the time of his infancy you can't blame him for it. It is much more a story aimed towards parents, and that's great, because that is a strong argument against the misconception that animation is just for children. And Ellen DeGeneres makes us all crack open in laughter and still maintains a sense of importance to Marlin learning a lesson. All characters are memorable, the story is beautiful, the animation was groundbreaking for its time and still looks great. What more could you want from an animated feature?","

"mitsubishizero","28 May 2019","Another original Pixar classic that will be enjoyed by families. The story's about a widowed Clownfish named Marlin(Albert Brooks) who struggles to let his son Nemo(Alexander Gould) grow up after a tragic accident that costs his wife and the rest of his kids. This causes him to be overprotective. While starting school for the first time a misunderstanding leads to Marlin and Nemo having an argument over something Nemo's accused of doing but doesn't. This leads to Nemo defying his father and getting being kidnapped afterwards. Panicked, the class flees while Marlin tries to chase after the boat his son's in where he literally bumps into another fish named Dory(Ellen Degeneres).Dory offers her assistance and tags along with him but she proves to be more of a hindrance than a help due to the fact that the Regal Blue Tang suffers from short-term memory loss. Even so she provides most of the comic relief in the movie. On their quest they come across sharks, seat turtles and jellyfish. Meanwhile, Nemo finds himself in an aquarium in a dentist's office in Australia with other fish who also provide comic relief and are plotting to escape back into the wild. Leading the Tank Gang is a hardened Moorish Idol fish named Gill(William Dafoe). Slowly and slowly Nemo learns to appreciate his Dad as well as be more independent while Marlin learns to be more laid back and to ""just keep swimming"".The animation's amazing. When the characters move it feels so natural and when you see the water it looks like actual water which's impressive. The story's been done before but as usual Pixar adds a twist to it. In this case it's told through the eyes of fish. The characters are interesting and likable. Marlin's a worry wart but at the same time you perfectly understand why and he means well. Dory could've been annoying but instead they develop her to be this ditsy yet complex character. For all her faults she really does try to help Marlin out. Nemo's nice to watch as well. He acts like a normal kid in that while he can be rebellious for the most part he just wants to do good and prove to his Dad that he can handle himself sometimes. He's not annoying he's just a kid. The music's enjoyable to listen to as well. It sounds epic which fits with the theme of exploration because that's what the characters do: Explore. I really like how they play Robbie Williams' cover of Bobby Darin's ""Beyond the Sea"" during the credits while the characters mess around. There's even a cameo of Mike from Monsters Inc.Finding Nemo is an enjoyable family film that never gets old both in the animation and story. It's visually amazing, has great storytelling and characters and when the movie ends you'll be saying ""Just keep swimming"". I highly recommend you check this movie out.","

I will always prefer hand drawn animation over computer any day of the week.However,there is no escaping the fact that this is a well done, entertaining film from Disney and Pixar.Keeping in mind the fact that fish,or anything else under water,can't talk,it's as if we are looking into an aquarium or watching actual undersea footage for the duration of the film.It is excellent family entertainment from start to finish. Pixar and Disney always seem to come up with a magical combination of near perfect animation right down to gestures and eye movements,and perfect voice casting.Ellen Degeneres is particularly hilarious as Dory. What we have here is a new age classic that even traditional,old fashioned people like myself can enjoy.","

"ray-280","1 August 2005","I saw Monsters, Inc. and thought it was a good film, but the animation and plot were a predictable technological evolution to the old Saturday morning cartoons. I couldn't bear Toy Story or A Bug's Life, so I'm definitely not a fan of the Pixar style, but this film transcends its genre and is one of the all-time classics, animated or not. All that is required for an incredible viewing experience is the suspension of a few minor disbeliefs: fish can't talk, and their eyes are on the sides of their heads (not their foreheads). That said, we have a nearly perfect film in that it couldn't have easily been improved upon.Before I continue, let me give credit to what makes this film perfect rather than merely great: ELLEN DEGENERIS. She should have gotten the Oscar for Best Actress with her portrayal of Dory, a character that could easily have been butchered by a weaker talent. Without her performance, this film is just Monsters, Inc. with better animation and a slightly better plot. Of the other actors, Albert Brooks is predictably competent as Marlin, while Willem DaFoe's jaded Gill is a treat for all ages. The remaining cast was decent, but interchangeable.As for the plot, it's simple: Marlin and Coral are proud parents of 400 eggs, all but one of whom (along with Coral) are killed in the opening sequence by a shark, which sets the tone of the movie in that we are repeatedly reminded that the Ocean is an underwater jungle. This is also a main strength of the movie in that the other fish in the ocean are portrayed as more than plot devices, and have lives (and goals) of their own, many of which involve putting Marlin (and Dory) in harm's way.The surviving egg, Nemo, is captured by a scuba diver and winds up in a fishtank in a dentist's office with a group of ""POW"" fish who are always trying (and failing) to escape. The ""secret world of fish"" angle does seem appropriated from Dr. Doolittle 2, but this can be forgiven as necessary for the plot. The story is a coming-of-age one not for Nemo, but for Marlin, whose quest for his lost son distracts him from his normal phobia of the ocean, sending him on an adventure which is inspirational as well as educational. I learned more about the ocean from watching this film than in all of my school years put together! Children under 12 should not watch this movie without an adult, as some of the scenes are downright scary, but this only adds to the realism of the film.","

"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","30 May 2023","I remember seeing this in theaters back in 2003 when I was 9 years old and loved it so much. 20 years later, I still love it I consider it one of the best Pixar films since the Toy Story trilogy.The animation is beautiful with some of the most breathtaking underwater effects while the character designs of the fish are both cute and expressive. The music score from Thomas Newman is both beautiful and haunting which enhances the dramatic tone of the movie. The story is superbly written as you understand Marlin's motivations in keeping Nemo safe after the death of his wife which makes the overprotective father cliche work. In fact, it even fleshes out the side characters especially Dory, a fish with short term memory loss, who is not only a good comic relief, but shares some good chemistry between Marlin. Even the other side characters like Crush the turtle and Nigel the Pelican are entertaining as they help the main two characters on their journey to find his lost son.The characters are both likeable and relatable at the same time with some superb voice performances. Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres and Alexander Gould both did great in their respective roles while the supporting actors like Willem Dafoe, Geoffrey Rush, Andrew Stanton Barry Humphries (who passed away last month R. I. P), Eric Bana, Brad Garrett, Allison Janney, etc, all did good jobs as the side characters especially Gill.Overall, Finding Nemo still holds up after 20 years since it's release. :)","

"TheNorthernMonkee","29 September 2003","SPOILERSSo here's Disney's latest animated adventure, and for those of us out there who love Disney, it's a treat.In ""Finding Nemo"" we are introduced to two clown fish (who aren't very funny) Nemo & his dad Marlin, who have an arguement as Marlin is overprotective & Nemo is taken by some Scuba Divers. This then leads to Marlin travelling across the ocean facing numerous obstacles in an attempt to get his son back (the rest of the family already dying before the opening credits).This film progresses in typical Disney style with bright characters (my personal favourites being the Turtles ..... dude!), imaginative scenarios and a couple of classic small sketches (the best being two seagulls sat on the surface and a small bubble appears next to Seagull A. Seagull B looks at him ""nice"" & flies off).Truth be told, the thing I love about this film is that I can't actually identify that many of the voices. If you look at ""Toy Story"" (still the bench mark, although personally ""Shrek"" is my alltime animation, but then, it isn't Disney), whilst the story is stunning, the voices are blatantly Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and many other well known faces, which ultimately I personally think hinders it slightly. Now if you look at ""Finding Nemo"" whilst one or two of the early characters voices are recogniseable (Ellen DeGeneres being the most notable) for the most part, they may be famous actors, but I found it hard to recognise the voices (hence my surprise at discovering Geoffrey Rush being in it). Ultimately this benefits my enjoyment as after a while, the voices literally become the characters own.To summarise, this is yet another quality Disney film which is both endering and satisfying. I confess to not being a big fan of recent Disney productions (found ""Monsters Inc"" a bit too infuriating for my tastes and not at all that funny), but with ""Finding Nemo"" they remind me where my heart truely belongs. A stunning film worth it's wait in Coral.","

"FilmOtaku","28 December 2003","As a traditional `kids movie Scrooge' with a couple of exceptions, no matter what people said about this movie, I wasn't going to watch it without a fight.   I finally realized that people were not going to give up trying to convert me until I had watched this film, so I eventually gave in and went into it with a surprisingly open mind.*Spoilers within*True to form, there was a reason that seemingly everyone on the planet saw this film, and not only saw it, but liked it.  I thought it was a really cute and touching story.  Not many kid films start out with the death of one's almost entire family, but this film did, therefore setting up the story of an overprotective clownfish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) whose son Nemo is suddenly snatched out of the ocean and place in a fish tank in a dentist's office.  Marlin must find Nemo before he falls into the hands of the dentist's horrible young girl whose last pet fish went belly up pretty quickly under her charge.Not only is the story rich, fun and cleverly written (at times with adults in mind) but the voice talent, most notably Ellen DeGeneres' work, is fantastic.  Probably the most striking feature of Finding Nemo however is its beauty  it is so sharp and colorful that I actually half-regretted not seeing it in the theater.  While Finding Nemo did not make me a Pixar/Disney disciple (pretty much an impossible task) I think that its sure Oscar win for Best Animated Feature will be as well-deserved as the win by `Spirited Away' last year.  Spirited Away was far superior in my opinion, but both films transcend the generic `animated feature' label.--Shelly","

"movies2u","17 June 2003","Finding Nemo was as expected a great, fun and exciting movie that anybody can enjoy. It is about a fish named Nemo who is caught by a diver and put into a fish tank at a dentist office. Nemo's father then meets Dory, a hilarious absent-minded fish and they go on many adventures together in order to find Nemo. The movie had many laughs and excitement. A great family movie. I give Finding Nemo a 10 out of 10.","

"saadanathan","5 April 2020","I love Finding Nemo!. It is considered one of the best Pixar pictures ever and definitely a game changer. What i love so much about it is the great dynamic between marlin and dory. The jokes are great. And I've seen this movie too many times to not like it. Besides it is very emotional and Pixar are always masters at creating emotional movies that can be so fantastic. The whole journey is full of excitements and key moments. Many messages are planted in this movies such as: father and son relationship and how you gain friends in unexpected ways.","

"flyingamon","15 April 2011","I have to think really hard to find anything bad to say about this movie. I guess the only thing I didn't like was the beginning where the mother of Nemo died (which we thankfully don't get to see but it's very obvious it happens). The story is a typical one where a parent is overprotective (in this case Nemo's dad) of its kid causing the kid to get rebellious and of course gets in trouble. The difference here is that it doesn't consider humans but fish. Although it's hard to find sympathy for Marlin (Nemo's dad) as he is sooooo serious and always talking, you get to admire him as the movie goes on for being so brave. Very good there is Dory, the girl who seems to forget things so easily that it actually becomes cute and funny. Every serious character needs such a backup and their chemistry proves to be working well. There is a lot of action and funny scenes in this one and has a strong story as well. This is among my favorite animated movies.","

"Keyska2004","8 January 2011","Two parents have babies until a big bad guy kill all but dad and junior. Dad has to raise junior now all on his own. Junior grows up and gets kidnapped and taken far away. Dad searches all over for him. Sounds like an everyday story that you might hear from the radio or read in the papers. Tough story to understand and realize. But, let's put this into perspective for our children to understand.This story is about little Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) and how he not only overcomes what life gave him (short stubby fin) but taking on challenges and adventures by himself and some friends along the way.But the true story is about a fathers' love for his son and everything that he would do to protect him. Marlin (father voiced by Albert Brooks) meets with a talkative and short term memory loss fish named Dori (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) and they end up taking a long journey in search of Nemo. This quest will lead Marlin and Dori through old shipwrecks, giant sharks, jellyfish, and the demons of the deep ocean, not to mention mankind also.Marlin is afraid of his own shadow, but with a little luck and many friends that he meets across the ocean he opens up and becomes the type of person we all dream of.The colors in this film make the ocean seem so realistic that you will enjoy watching this film without your kids in the same room. Life is special and short, we need to strive for all we can be, and always help out others. This movie is a definite Pick-Me-Up film.",NA
"swilliky","2 July 2016","One of Pixar's original successes was the fish adventure, Finding Nemo. The story follows Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) a clownfish who has developed a great fear of the open ocean after his wife and all of his eggs are destroyed by a barracuda, except one, Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould). The story picks up on Nemo's first day of school. He has a small fin due to the accident at his birth. Marlin is anxious about letting his son go but stunts his growth and prevents him from having experiences.Nemo grows frustrated with his overprotective parent and swims out to touch a boat, hilariously referred to by the other young fish as a butt. Nemo is captured by a scuba-diving dentist and whisked away to Sydney, Australia. Distraught, Marlin sets out to find his son. He encounters Dory (voiced by Ellen Degeneres), a blue tang with short-term memory loss. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",NA

Finding Nemo is a personal favorite of mine! The humor is innocent, yet, I have line's memorized, and I can't stop laughing!! One of my favorite actor's, Sir Willem Dafoe, who provides the voice of Gil, play's Norman Osborn/Green Goblin in the Spider-Man franchise, did a phenomenal job!! The acting is great by all the voice talents. Ellen Degeneres is hysterical as the short term memory struggling blue fish! The story line is great. This is a great movie for everyone! I enjoyed this a lot more than Shrek The Third!! This is a MUST for Disney fans!!",NA
"rebeljenn","24 November 2005","'Finding Nemo' is a touching little story about a cute little clownfish who gets separated from his father. The father sets out on a journey to find Nemo, the lost little clownfish, and he meets several new friends along the way, including a blue fish with memory problems named Dori and a group of Australian turtles.The story is a cute one with a wide range of characters that will appeal to children and events that are frightening and challenging that the father must go through in order to find his son. It's a typical children's cartoon, really, using the ideas of other stories before it.The animation is done well - particularly under the water, which is difficult to animate. However, the pacing of the film gets a little bit slow in some places. While the father is searching for Nemo, the events seem to go on and on. Also, I found Dori to be very trying and annoying. The jokes about her and memory loss went on far too long, and I just found this to be too annoying. Children may like that, but it made the film less enjoyable for me.Overall, I would rate this as an average film - particularly over other children's films. I cannot fault the animation, though.",NA
"joshuaroulane95","18 February 2015","I really enjoyed this movie from day one. I can't help but to find myself watching 'NEMO"" every now and again. This movie has a great story line, and will keep you anxious based on the characters. I will have to say that ""DORI"" played by the wonderful Ellen DeGeneres would be my favorite character in the whole movie. I love how comedic she is. She is clumsy, forgetful, and well you will just have to watch the movie to really she how funny she is. This movie is perfect for all ages, I'm 19 and I still watch it. I can't tell you how excited I am for the movie ""Finding Dori""to come out. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Definitely a 10/10.",NA
"bookmanjunior","13 September 2006","""Finding Nemo"" is obviously a good movie. But, like many Pixar films, it's overrated. It seems they give more attention to CGI movies than older animated classics like ""The Lion King"" and ""Beauty And The Beast"", that deserve to be in the Top 250 instead of this kind of film. There are good Pixar films, like ""Cars"" and ""The Incredibles"", but I don't think that it deserves to rank the 2nd best Disney film ever behind only The Incredibles. Now, they also leave out ""Pinocchio"", ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs"", ""Dumbo"", ""Bambi"", and other classics created during Disney's life. This is a very good movie, but I think it deserves the highest rating of a 7.3 or 7.4.",NA
"Ben_Cheshire","16 October 2003","This is great entertainment, don't get me wrong, but i can't help feeling that Disney is cheating the consumer by making movies more like products than artworks. There are some new jokes in this movie, but they've just used the same formula they've been using since Walt was a boy.
When Shrek first came out, i thought - wow! Disney has taken a big leap here. It was clever, satirical, and hugely funny.Then, when Monster's Ink, Toy Story 2 and then Finding Nemo came out, it made me remember every single handdrawn Disney since the forties - there's always two people, usually males, a big person and a little person, at first they don't get along, and at the end they realise the most important thing - their friendship. Shrek and Donkey, Buzz and Woody, Sulley and Mike, Flik and the circus bugs, Simba and Nala, Timon and Pumba, Fox and Hound, Beauty and Beast, Lilo and Stitch, Mermaid and Flounder, Lady and Tramp, Mannie and Sid (Ice Age), Dumbo and Timothy Q Mouse, Pinnochio and Jiminy Cricket, Alladin and Abu, the list goes on. Ooh, i almost forgot: Marlin and Dory.It was sweet the first time, but by now its tired. The latest toy off the production line is ""Brother Bear""... need i say more?Give us something remotely new, innovative, like the small step forward Shrek was.",NA
"Simone-6","26 December 2007","Judging from the reviews I just read of Finding Nemo, it looks like there are two kinds of reviewers: those who want a film that mirrors and idealizes their lives, no questions asked, and those who want a film that raises interesting questions. I'm in the latter category and as such, I have to say that this was perhaps the most boring and vapid film I have ever watched. For me, watching replicas of family, school life, dentists' offices, etc. without some sort of commentary just isn't interesting. And no, beautiful animation is not enough. So maybe we need to revisit the eighteenth century, when people -- Americans included -- were proud to think, question, and use reason in their everyday existence. Maybe that would produce an animated film that would allow Nemo and his dad to move beyond platitudes, tell the audience something new, and actually be funny (jokes in the Eisenhower era were funnier than this film). ""Sapere Aude!"" Thank you, Immanuel Kant.",NA
"long-ford","9 January 2009","Finding Nemo is a thoroughly charming animated feature and continues Pixar's dream run. Telling the story of how a clown fish struggles to reunite with his son, the film has a slightly scary beginning and invokes memories of Bambi's mother! The animation quality is stellar. Special mention for the dream-like jellyfish scene with its hidden menace. Ellen Degeneres steals the show with her wisecracks. Albert Brooks is occasionally annoying as the over-protective dad. The film is just a bit too long and could have been trimmed. It has a 'three hanky' emotional ending and you will probably leave the film with a smile on your face.Overall 8/10",NA
"grahamsj3","24 January 2004","This is a well-executed film that is pretty entertaining. The animation is great (kudos to Pixar again) and the folks who provided the voices were spot on - except one, that is. The character Crush sounded like a VERY poor imitation of Sean Penn's Jeff Spicoli from Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I'm a huge fan of that film and so I didn't take to the imitation. Other than that, this is a thoroughly entertaining piece of work, and one that the folks who put it together can be proud of.",NA

"artzau","1 August 2003","Hey, I was skeptical.  All the flap...over a fish cartoon?  But, as the rave reviews came surfing in, my suspicions grew.  What could be good about a fish searching for another fish...?  My grandkids came to town and drug me along.  AND, I loved it!  This has got to be the best Disney in a long, long time.  This has great personal emotional moments without being maudlin and sentiment without being overly sweet. The bad guys are not evil...they're just on the other side of the firing line.  The AA-like ""Fish are friends, not food"" sharks with their meetings, saluting and confrontations (""Denial!"") are hilarious, as is the dentist and his kid-from-Hell niece, with the braces and music from Psycho.There's just lots in this film to enjoy-- for everybody.

Would recommend this one to anyone as it's fit for young and old alike.",NA
"EricVierthaler92","26 January 2011","I don't hate this movie but it's not as perfect as everybody says it is. When I first saw it I loved it but looking back on it, it just doesn't hold up to me as it did before. I can understand why Marlin is so over protective over his son because he lost his wife and other kids. But for one Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) was annoying. A lot of people say that Dory is funny but I disagree I thought she was irritating. I just wanted to strangle her. She kept on forgetting everything. At around the end of the movie she says to Marlin (Nemo's dad) that she ""Remembers stuff whenever she's around her"" Um I have to call BS on that because the only thing she could remember was Sydney and she couldn't remember anything else. And the sharks. The sharks are hypocrites. They say that ""Fish are friends! Not food!"" but you clearly see a shark with fish bones in its mouth. That's really hypocritical! Sometimes Marlin got annoying with how overprotective he was. I mean god I thought Simba was over protective in Lion King 2 but Marlin tops him! The music in the movie is nothing special. You might think that I hate this movie because of the negative things I have said about it no I don't hate it. I liked the turtles, the birds that repeatedly said ""Mine!"", the main character that was a bird that helped Marlin and Dory. The plot was good enough to keep me interested but as I have said, it's overrated. Doesn't top Toy Story 1-3. So I give Finding Nemo a 6 out of 10.",NA
"Mightyzebra","2 March 2008","This is arguably the most beautiful and most captivating of all the Pixar films to date. It is good for most children because they will like the characters, find it funny and exciting and learn valuable lessons. Adults may like it because of the beauty of the CGI, the characters and the feeling of charm and a different kind of friendship and love in this film. Adults and children may feel sad with love for the film and the characters when catastrophes happen, they may feel happy when there are funny scenes and when something good happens to the characters. This is one truly magical, beautiful and entertaining film, possessing few flaws and just about every quality an animated film should possess.The storyline of the film is exciting and captivating - also funny. It starts sadly, when a mate of a clownfish dies, Coral, the mate of Marlin. All of their eggs are also eaten - save one egg. Marlin calls the little fish inside (the name that Coral wanted to give one of their babies) Nemo. A few fish years later, Nemo is ready to go to school, but Marlin is an incredibly protective father and is not so sure. Despite his worries, he lets the eager Nemo go to school, but is still cautious. It turns out he has a right to be - when Nemo is captured by divers! Marlin does the unthinkable, he goes out into the open ocean to find his son - encountering dangers and a new friend (Dory) on the way...Good for just about everyone.

"meydiana-65242","18 October 2020","Swimming with Sharks is a Whale of a Time
Marlin, a nervous and neurotic clownfish is heavily overprotective of his son Nemo, who only wants to explore the sea in its entirety. When Nemo gets caught by a scuba diver and taken away, it is up to Marlin to swallow his own fears and find Nemo. The ensuing search and rescue organized by the him is a mass effort by swimming and flying creatures of all sizes and personalities, such as a threesome of vegetarian sharks, a fish with short term memory and an aged turtle, all helping him realise the error of his ways in restricting himself to just his home.As charming as it is beautiful, Finding Nemo is a joy, both visually and cinematically. The characters are all so appealing and sweet that you want to hug each and every one of them, Nemo and Dory in particular. But the film transcends above just a generic animated film, for there are lessons to be learnt by it too. The film often tells a children's tale from an adult's point of view, with risky situations and emotional soul-searching putting stress on a disjointed family.The sea is brought to us in such a memorable and unique way that there is brilliance and beauty in every frame. The animation is of all time high for Pixar, and the sound mixing and editing are also to be credited, as they capture the heart of the sea creditably. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the musical score by Thomas Newman. He creates the essence of the sea, as well as the emotions felt by the fish throughout. Note the masterwork that occurs as an upbeat, jovial number quickly escalates into something darker in a matter of minutes. In short, the music is superb.The voice cast are capable and cannily chosen, from young Alexander Gould as the naïve Nemo, as well as Albert Brooks as the bumbling Marlin. But the star of the show is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory. As the forgetful but caring fish, she is sweet and soulful, and provides much of the comedy of the film. But the humour is also provided by the great script, which delivers a potentially dull story with wit and soul, and shies away from the sentimentality that could so easily arise of a Disney film. And the jokes, what jokes - from satire, spoof and slapstick, they'll be a one-liner for everybody here.Gorgeous to look at and utterly adorable, Finding Nemo sets the standard for how animated movies should being terms of entertainment value as well as story and themes - ending with the touching, thought-provoking message of how too much protectiveness on the parent's side will repel, but, no matter how independent a child (or fish) believes themselves to be, they'll always need their parents.",NA
"Tashtago","23 November 2007","When I first saw this film with my then 5 year old son, I thought it was pretty good. Subsequent viewings have revealed major flaws. Perhaps this is a little heavy considering it's a children's movie but I have seen many children films and there a lots that I can watch over and over again. Alice in Wonderland, the Jungle Book, etc. The biggest flaw,someone else mentioned it earlier,is the non-stop intense action sequences. The film begins with Nemo's mother being eaten by a barracuda, for any kid who understands the context this must be terrifying, it's followed by another excruciating scene when Nemo is scooped up by divers. Anyone with separation anxiety will have trouble with this scene. Accompanying this are an assortment of loud banging noises, intense thuds, and Psycho inspired music. Then there are the characters Nemo's okay, but his Dad is a whining, irritating jerk, Dory is funny for a while but then her stupidity becomes annoying. And the surfer dude turtle Ozzie accent- all wrong. Overall if you are a parent deciding to rent this for the kids reach for the Aristocats instead.",NA
"roedyg","23 June 2007","I am interested mostly of the effect of this movie on young kids, not on the adults dragged along.Most of animations are terrifying -- being stuck in the mouth of a whale, being surrounded by flocks of seagulls, being caught in a net. Animation's ability to exaggerate makes these events shocking. I remember being five watching Snow White terrified out of my mind hiding under my seat. Perhaps today's kids are more jaded.The movie sees human activity through fish eyes, and the mindless destructiveness of human activity. Just as Bambi put children off hunting in my generation, Finding Nemo should work against commercial fishing for this one.Nemo and his father are repeatedly caught in totally hopeless situations, but the both refuse to surrender and by the skin of their teeth prevail. This is great conditioning for kids. Dory's ditzy lack of understanding of the danger takes a little of the edge off the terror, even though logically she is adding to the predicament.I laughed when it turned out the arch villain of the show was a little girl who liked to buy pet fish then not care for them.As an adult, the schmaltzy opening between Marlon and Coral was just so anthropomorphic it put me off. I would have preferred a slightly more realistic representation of fish ""thoughts"". The characters were just too crass to be clown fish. It just did not fit.That's an odd criticism coming from someone who found a Meercat in the Lion King doing the hula was the funniest thing I ever saw.One final comment. Albert Brooks as Nemo's father sometimes appeared to be channeling the late Sterling Holloway.",NA

"movieguy1021","1 August 2003","The line between fantasy and reality is becoming rapidly blurred. It seems that all computer-animated movies are doing extremely well, while the hand-drawn ones seem to be either direct-to-video sequels nobody wanted, box office bombs, or have horrendous ideas. Finding Nemo may soon be the highest grossing animated movie ever, simply because it's easy to look at. It's not as good as Pixar's other movies because it lacks the one key ingredient that made Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. work so well. Most kids never feared of being taken away by a man and being put into a fish tank in a dentist's office. However, I don't think there's a child alive who never thought that their toys moved when they weren't there or that there were monsters in the closet. Because of this, Finding Nemo couldn't connect as well, because, simply, it wasn't something that anyone thought of in real life.The plot has Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clownfish who can never tell good jokes, with his wife Coral (Elizabeth Perkins) (where DO they get these names?), who just moved into a new home. A shark, however, eats Coral and all but one of her eggs. A few years later, Marlin raises Nemo (Alexander Gould) in an overprotective environment. To prove his dad wrong, Nemo swims out into the open ocean and is scooped up by a diver. Marlin goes on a search to find Nemo, and, along the way, meets over-the-top Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), who has short-term memory loss.Finding Nemo has lavish landscapes. It really looks like the ocean, and, although none of the fish or creatures in the ocean looked real, they were well done. The best animation that Pixar does is with real things (like in the opening short, Knick Knack). Although they have some work to do with humans to make them look realistic, a few scenes, set in a doctor's office, looked incredibly real. Maybe if Pixar and PDI (who did Shrek) exchange secrets than Pixar could have better looking humans and PDI could have more realistic surroundings.The only character that made me constantly laugh in this comedy was Dory. Although most of the target audience would not understand most of it, her short-term memory loss was a genius addition to the script. She was so uninhibited, it was really hilarious. However, Brooks, as Marlin, didn't really do much for me. If his ability to not be able to tell a joke had been played out more, it would've worked more. His paranoid behavior also ebbed and flowed, while if he had another quirk that he could do throughout the movie, would've worked more, also. The fun part about animated movies is all of the voices. I couldn't tell most of them, but I did recognize Willem Dafoe. Others include Allison Janney, Brad Garrett, Erik Per Sullivan, Stephen Root, Vicki Lewis, and Geoffrey Rush.There's not a real moral to Finding Nemo. What is there to learn? All I've learned is from the opening credits that snowmen desperately want to leave their snowglobes. Basically, Finding Nemo won't go into the same category as Toy Story or Monsters, Inc.. Instead, it'll probably go into the `forgotten' category like A Bug's Life.My rating: 6/10Rated G.",NA
"mfellipecampos","7 June 2020","Oscar-winning animation of the category in 2003, Finding Nemo was a huge box office hit - estimated at about $ 871 million worldwide - and marked the memory of millions of viewers, children or not, worldwide, for their affection , friendliness and humor of his fish-characters.Many people identified, in fact, with the lack of notion and memory of the lovely Dory, the little fish that accompanies the protagonist, Marlin, in the long journey across the ocean in search of the lost little boy, Nemo. In the original version, too, Ellen DeGeneres won a well-deserved award, The MTV Movie, for best comic performance. The other original voices are: Alexander Gould (Nemo) and Albert Brooks (Marlin). But, in this relaunch in 3D, only dubbed versions will be available.As a matter of fact, the new 3D version does not strictly add anything to the excellent animation - whose strength is what most of the genre (and not just him) lack, good scripts. The ingredients for general identification are all there: parent-child relationship; overprotection after tragically losing his wife; the son's desire to show courage and challenge the limitations of a slightly defective fin; the inexhaustible generosity of friend Dory, despite her own limitations; overcoming countless dangers, including environmental ones, to be victorious at the end of the journey.Putting it all together in a beautiful and detailed underwater scenery, in which sharks, turtles, dolphins and all kinds of fish coexist and cooperate, the drawing becomes an epic adventure, tempered with humor. It was not for nothing that, in 2008, the American Film Institute nominated Finding Nemo as one of the ten best animated films of all time. He deserves it - 3D is just cute to please today's fashion, but it doesn't hurt either.I liked this criticism of CinewebFilm reviewed on the 6th to the 7th of 2020.",NA

There are also loads and loads of characters in the movie change from one place to the other, this make sure you'll never get bored. The action are also very consistence. Ellen did absolutely a brilliant job renting her voice, so is other actors.I love this movie and without doubt so is millions of people both adult and kids. It is so famous that nowadays people called crown fish ""Nemo"". From my experience this is definitely one of the best animation movie ever created.

The plot was not boring and at the same time simplistic in a way that it was easy to add certain details to make it way more fun to watch. The hype around it was definitely justifiable.

"PedanticEditor","17 March 2008","The average viewing public must be extraordinarily callous these days not to at least be a little shocked by the movie's content. This film has the emotional elements of a holocaust film with overtones of horror film. They should have named it ""instant nightmare in a film can"". This is, by far, the most emotionally brutal cartoon I have ever seen and the fact that it was marketed as a kids movie is unbelievable! The movie begins when an entire family of fish (with the exception of the father and one of his sons) is slaughtered by what looks like a barracuda. When the son (Nemo) goes on a school field trip, he almost does something stupid because of peer pressure. His father then threatens to take him out of school, to which Nemo replies by doing the something markedly stupider out of spite, resulting in his being captured by a diver and taken away in a boat. The father spends the rest of the movie following the direction the boat went when it disappeared. During his journey the father finds another fish with which he can have emotional issues and repeatedly encounters creatures that are introduced in a horrific enough fashion so that it probably kept hundreds of children's beds wet for weeks after the film's premier. The combination of the odious, depressing characters and the slasher-film style directing/music that most of the film seems to possess culminates in producing wastebasket fodder even more potently un-watchable than The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005).",NA
"EmperorNortonII","1 June 2003","Ever since they made their feature-film debut with ""Toy Story,"" the Pixar studio has proven itself as the master of computer animation.

The story is great as well, containing both laughs and heartfelt moments.  Albert Brooks is perfectly cast as the voice of Marlin, the neurotic clown fish father to Nemo.  Ellen DeGeneres also puts in a funny performance as Dory, a blue tang with a short-term memory. Other memorable characters include Bruce, Anchor and Chum, the trio of sharks, and Crush the sea turtle.  One great detail was the epilogue, which was an original replacement for Pixar's formulaic ""blooper reel.""  So I think we can call ""Finding Nemo"" the new jewel in Pixar's crown.",NA
"Laakbaar","14 January 2014","This latter-day Disney movie is a classic after only ten years. The plot is straightforward: father loses son; father goes on quest to find son; father finds son.The two complementary underlying messages are ""give your kids room to grow"" and ""listen to your father because he loves you"". There are some serious moments in the film.The real star of this movie is the incredible animation. The artists at Pixar have brought the reef to life, infusing the animations with eye-catching colour, light and movement.Another hallmark of the animation is the charming anthropomorphism of the underwater creatures. The characters are all denizens of a rich underwater kingdom. Poor Dory almost steals the show, but several other characters also stand out.The third underlying message (and one that is sorely needed) is that we should love this beautiful world and do what we can to protect it. Sadly, it looks now like we'll lose it all in a few generations.A clever, funny, entertaining Disney film. Not just for kids. This movie is considered to be the 10th best Disney animated film, but I think it should be rated higher. I think it's worth about 8.5, but I'm willing to round it up for now.",NA
