Seriously, I know that sounds stupid as this is an animated movie, but why can't we have a favorite movie that's animated? If you ask me this is Disney's best animated film of all time. Why do you ask? The animation is just beautiful, the story is powerful and moving, the characters are terrific, the villain is one of Disney's most monstrous and the songs are out of this world incredible! Not only is it my favorite animated movie, this is one of my favorite soundtracks, with the strong power of Elton John The Lion King is absolutely beautiful and a pleasure to watch still to this day. I have to say also that this story is just so beautiful, it's still one of the movies that will always bring a tear to my eye. When I was 17 years old, I begged my dad to take me to the re-release of The Lion King, him and I being the only adults besides the parents who took their children to see the movie, Simba's father dies and I started balling! My dad looks around and said "Krissy, stop it!" and I just said "But it's so saaaaad! Simba's daddy!", yes I'm a sap, I can't help it, this is a powerful movie.In the Pride Lands, Rafiki, a wise old monkey, anoints Simba, the newborn cub of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, and presents him to a gathering of animals at Pride Rock. Taking advantage of the cub's naive nature, Simba's scheming uncle Scar, who is very angry because Simba's birth means that he's no longer next in line to the throne tells him about the elephant graveyard, a place where Mufasa has forbidden Simba to go. Simba asks his mother if he can go to the water-hole with his best friend, Nala, but they go to the graveyard instead. There, the cubs are met by Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, 3 hyenas who try to kill them, but they are rescued by Mufasa. But Scar doesn't give up there, he lures Simba into a gorge for a "surprise from his father" while the hyenas create a wildebeest stampede. Alerted by Scar, Mufasa races to rescue Simba from the stampede. He saves his son but is left clinging to the edge of a steep cliff. Scar flings his brother into the stampede below. Simba sees his father fall and rushes down the cliff after him, only to find him dead. Scar convinces Simba that he was responsible for his father's death and recommends that he runs away from the Pride Lands to avoid punishment. In a distant desert, Simba is found unconscious by Timon and Pumbaa, a duo who adopt and raise the cub under their worry-free philosophy, Hakuna Matata. When Simba has grown into an adult he is discovered by Nala, who tells him that Scar, through his irresponsibility, has turned the Pride Lands into a barren wasteland. She asks Simba to return and take his place as king but Simba refuses, still believing he caused his father's death. Rafiki arrives and persuades Simba to return to the Pride Lands, and face Scar once and for all.I know that still that Beauty and the Beast is the only animated film to get a best picture nomination, but I don't understand why The Lion King didn't get the same treatment. I adore this film with such a passion, I will always defend it to the high end. I still watch this movie, ever since it's theatrical release in 1994, I still sing, dance, and rehears the lines back and forth. How could you not at least with Hakuna Matata? Timon is my idol, he's so care free, funny, and awesome during his drag hula scene\u0085 "Luau! If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat, eat my buddy Pumbaa here, 'cause he's a tasty treat come on down and dine, on this tasty swine, all you gotta is get in line, are you achin',? For some bacon? He's a big pig. You can be a big pig, too. Oy!\u0085 Ahhhh!", best scene ever in film history! OK, not in history, but one of my favorites, it always has me on the floor laughing till my stomach hurts. If you seriously haven't seen this movie, see it! Who said that animated movies can't be true art? The Lion King is a fantastic film and deserves all it's praise and more.10/10

                                                         The Lion King is a great film.  Along with a great story (inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet), terrific animation, and an all star cast of voices, there are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a little rough for the younger children).  Like responsibility and honor.I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen.  It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget.  And hopefully, you won't either.  A++

is a film that can entertain anyone young or old, I usually don't care for animated movies but this film is the real deal, this is one of disney's best animated movies. The animation is top notch and flawless. This film also features superb work from the vocal cast James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg. This is a standout.

Delightful animated feature from Walt Disney Pictures about a naive young lion cub destined for greatness. Born the son of a beloved and authoritative king he's groomed to be the next ruler of the kingdom, but along the way he encounters tragic detours at the hands of his villainous uncle and scheming hyena henchmen. Years later—as an adult—he decides to embrace his destiny and take his proper place in the Circle of Life. Warm, intelligent, laugh-out loud funny film is a triumph in every aspect; unforgettable songs, snappy dialogue, remarkable animation, and a stellar cast of voices make this a treat for all ages. A rousing adventure that you can enjoy again and again, and arguably one of the finest animated films ever made. ****

compelling story and first-class animation. Young lion cub Simba is to be king, but he leaves after he believes he was the reason for his father's death (of course this is not so). As he grows up, he goes on a journey of love, friendship and discovery which will lead him back to his rightful place in the world. Excellent. 5 stars out of 5.

                                      Released Christmas Day in 2002 to IMAX and large format screens, The Lion King makes a triumphant return to the screen after eight years. Its every bit as majestic and great as it has been before.The Lion King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) just had a baby cub named Simba. All of the animals come to the ceremony, except for Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons). Scar desperately wants to be King, but can't. As long as Mufasa and Simba are there. Soon Simba is able to walk and talk and is voiced by Jonathon Taylor Thomas. After hearing about an elephant graveyard from Scar, he and his friend Nala (Niketa Calame) visit it. They meet three bumbling hyenas: Banzai (Cheech Marin), Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), and Ed (Jim Cummings), but they manage to leave unhurt. Scar is upset that the hyenas didn't do the job, so he orders a stampede to wipe out both of them, but it only takes care of Mufasa. Scar convinces Simba that he killed Mufasa, not Scar. So Simba flees into exile.The Lion King really benefits from the larger screen. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more, and you can really savor the animation. Disney didn't need any humans, so they could spend all of the time on a great story and lush landscapes. In fact, its camera movement was so majestic that you actually felt like you were part of the pride of lions.The music boomed and really created the atmosphere. Although I had seen this picture before, I still was tense because of the way the music played out. Most of the time, I would just roll my eyes at the attempt to make me nervous. But Hans Zimmer's music really bowled me over and made my heart do calisthenics. Unlike such new Disney pics like Lilo and Stitch, the songs actually did some good. They took you out of a somewhat dreary mood and put a smile on your face and made your feet want to tap along. There were only a few, but they were very entertaining. And the Circle of Life song at the beginning was beautiful, with its perfect pictures and perfect sound.I really like James Earl Jones (he's pretty diverse), and this time was no exception. He seemed to act like he didn't want to do this role, but he couldn't contain his excitement for wanting to do voice-overs again (he had done some work in The Simpsons before). Matthew Broderick redeemed himself for me (after the atrocious Ferris Bueller's Day Off) by showing a strong voicing as the adult Simba. Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg, and Jim Cummings really had good chemistry together, even though they didn't have much screen time. Irons was really good and creepy as Scar (one of those who you can't help but hate), and if that is him really singing, brava!Be warned, The Lion King isn't really for youngsters. It had intense thematic elements that should have warranted a PG, instead of those that don't deserve it (Lilo and Stitch, again). The mood that the music and the script brought out could damper your day, so be warned.This is one movie where you can feel for the characters. You don't say `haha, he's dead', you say `Gasp! I'm so sad!' If it weren't for the gifted scriptwriters, this movie would be kaput and a nothing, not the best Disney movie ever made.The Lion King is a majestic movie, not without humor, that is for almost all to see.My rating: 9/10Rated G for intense thematic elements.

funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! My personal favorite character is Rafiki, the Baboon! I still cant forget the line he says to Simbe, "Past can hurt, but as I see it, you can either run from it, or learn from it!" it is so true! i loved Zazu's weirdness, and shenzi's humor, above all, i loved Pumba's innocence and Timon's intelligence! In short, i found the film the best film ever... The voice cast is also great. Mathew did complete justice to Simba, and what can I say about Mufasa, He is the best King, and dad anyone can ever get! The movie is not meant for kids, its meant to teach every adult a lesson...to find our place in the great "Circle Of Life". I give this film a perfect 10.

               This movie is, quite seriously, the Citizen Kane of Disney animation. Every animated movie from Disney ever since has been a failed attempt to recreate the masterpiece that this film is. This movie is an anomaly in a market usually dominated by formulaic kiddie-fare. Unlike most films from animation studios, this movie will enthrall you, whether you're 5 years old, or 50. An epic plot, intriguing characters, great music and hillarious moments make this film a family classic that will endure through the ages. 10/10

fantastic movie, and I am not lying! my 13 year old sister loves this movie, and I can't fault this either. It was one of the first movies I ever saw, so that accounts for how much I love it. The animation is superb, the backgrounds look so rich, and for once, there are no stiff movements. The highlights were the stampede and the fight between Scar and Simba. The music by Hans Zimmer is outstanding, a perfect mix of African chants and pure Hollywood. The songs are absolutely great, I had no idea that Elton John could write like that. The best song is "Can you feel the Love Tonight?" but the others go without fault, "Circle of Life" is so spirit rousing especially. Likewise with the voice overs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is very likable as Young Simba, and Matthew Broderick, while not as good, is above average too. James Earl Jones lends his booming voice to the majestic King Mufassa, and Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg provide flawless comic relief. The vocal standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar, who frightened me when I was little. Scar is up there with the best Disney villains, like Jafar, Malificent and Frollo. The humour here is fantastic, and you cry here a bit here as well. I highly recommend the stage version in the West End, and the sequels are actually two of the better DTV sequels.10/10. Bethany Cox

The music, the visuals, the dialogue, the voice acting, etc. Rewatched this one and remembered why this was my favorite Disney movie growing up. From mufasa's death to the goofy hyenas, to the bond between rafiki, simba and mufasa. The music that everyone knows every word to, and scar's ability to deliver each line perfectly. This movie is magic, the new one seems to tech focused and forgot what made lion king so beloved to begin with, its unfortunate. Hoping the circle of life makes it way around and the end of remakes draws close (see what I did there lol). Until then, lion king from the 90s will stay on my shelf and my kids will watch with me. This new one will never end up in my cart and I wont confuse my kids by watching it either. Thank you 90s Disney for the magic!

Pixar movies). In my mind, this is the last classic hand drawn film, and it upsets me that I have to wait for another five years for it to come out on DVD. This film deals with great issues and involves a huge conflict for the main character, something that recent kid/family films lack. It is funny and lighthearted when it should be, and heartfelt and serious when it needs it. I believe that everybody should see this movie, regardless of your age. It may just be the last good movie that Disney will ever do without the help of Pixar.

that will keep on delivering to Disney fans like myself...TLK is a wonderful film with great characters and songs with a powerful message that you can always find your way back no matter how hard the

Its acclaim is understandable: this is quite simply a glorious work of art."The Lion King" gets off to a fantastic start. The film's opening number, "The Circle of Life," is outstanding. The song lasts for about four minutes, but from the first sound, the audience is floored. Not even National Geographic can capture something this beautiful and dramatic. Not only is this easily the greatest moment in film animation, this is one of the greatest sequences in film history.The story that follows is not as majestic, but the film has to tell a story. Actually, the rest of the film holds up quite well. The story takes place in Africa, where the lions rule. Their king, Mufasa (James Earl Jones) has just been blessed with a son, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), who goes in front of his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) as next in line for the throne. Scar is furious, and sets in motion plans to usurp the throne for himself. After a tragedy occurs and Mufasa is killed, Scar persuades Simba to flee, leaving himself as king. Simba grows up in exile, but he learns that while he can run away from his past, he can never escape it.When viewing the film, it is obvious that "The Lion King" is quite different from its predecessors (and successors). This is an epic story that contains more dramatic power than all the other Disney films combined. While there are definitely some light-hearted moments, there is no denying the dark drama that takes up the bulk of the story. While it could be argued that Disney is the champion of family entertainment, this film is not for the very young. Some of the sequences are very dark and violent, many bordering on frightening, even for the older crowd.The voice actors are terrific. Jonathan Taylor Thomas brings a large dose of innocence to Young Simba. He's mischievous, but also terribly naive. His older counterpart, voiced by Matthew Broderick, equals him. He's older, but no less mature. The voices are so similar that it's almost impossible not to believe that they are the same character at different ages. Perhaps no one could have been better suited for the role of Mufasa than James Earl Jones. His baritone voice gives the Mufasa a quality of great power and wisdom; there is no question that his role is king. As Scar, Jeremy Irons is pitch-perfect. The drawing of the character is villainous, but Irons' vocal work complements the animation to create one of the most memorable, and vicious, villains in Disney history. He's unquestionably evil, but he's also clever, which makes him all the more dangerous. Manipulation, not violence is his greatest weapon. Providing some much needed comic relief are Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts (a meerkat and a warthog), and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. While there is definite fun from these characters, neither the actors nor the filmmakers allow them to go over-the-top and destroy the mood of the film.Disney's animated features are known for their gorgeous artwork. Nowhere is this more apparent than in "The Lion King." Every single frame is jaw-dropping. The colors are rich, and the drawings are sharp and beautiful. One of the pitfalls of animation (both computer and hand-drawn) is that there is sometimes a visible distance between the subject and the background, making it seem as if the figure animation was cut and pasted on the background (this is obviously what happens, but it is up to the artists to make sure that it isn't noticeable). There is none of that here.Throughout the Golden Age of Disney animation, the films have been musicals. "The Lion King" is no different, and the songs are brilliant. All of the numbers are standouts ("Can You Feel the Love Tonight" won the Oscar, but in my opinion, "The Circle of Life" was better). In the cases of Simba and Nala (Simba's girlfriend), both young and old, there is a noticeable difference between the speaking and singing parts (everyone else does their own singing and speaking), but never mind. It still works, and that's what's important."The Lion King" is not flawless, but on first viewing, they aren't noticeable, and it is likely that the young won't ever notice them. "Beauty and the Beast" was the first animated film to get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (it lost to "The Silence of the Lambs"), and is thus far the only animated film to receive such an honor. That being the case, it's hard to understand why "The Lion King" was not given the same distinction. The two films are more or less equal in quality, and the nominees for the honor that year were not strong.If you haven't already, see "The Lion King." You won't be disappointed.

I realize that it has been criticized for political incorrectness. The fact of the matter is that it has strong female characters as well as male, and it's about a vision of monarchy. I have the greatest respect for female role models but I really don't see this as a worthy criticism. It's a great story of defeat and betrayal and renewal. It has delightful individual characters, dressed up to show their beings in a clever way. It has the most despicable villains with Scar and the Hyenas. It has the Henry II thing about duty. It doesn't glorify fooling around as one of my colleagues told me. The free life is OK but at some time you must follow your heart and redeem yourself. The music is outstanding; another triumph or the Disney team. There are three or four numbers that are so critical to a complete understanding of the events of the story. The sound effects person should have been rewarded because sound is so critical in this. From the stampede to the forbidden areas of the kingdom. I watched this about sixty times with my small children and never really tired of it. I would put this at the top of any list of animated adventures.

me - the best. My mother even told me that I watched it every day as a child!)The tragic story is really instructive, beautiful landscapes and a very warm atmosphere that is memorable. The prescribed characters and the original idea - all this makes watching interesting for any age.Legendary music, beautiful animation and other things that will make you fall in love with this cartoon.It is very strange if someone has not seen this masterpiece yet.

one of the best Disney movies ever. I really enjoyed it when I first seen it, about when I was 6, and since then I watched it over and over again. I simply LOOOOVED the music. It's one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. And, speaking of soundtrack, I just can't tell in words how much I love the song "Can You Feel The Love Tonight". Is one of my favorite songs ever. I truly believe that this motion picture could easily be nominated for The Best Picture, but The Best Song and the Best Original Score is really enough. I wonder if they will ever think to make a prequel of this movie in order to understand who is Mufasa, Scar, Sarabi and the other characters. In short, this movie will be remembered in the next 100 years. Truly.

challenge for the crown.I vowed to watch more Disney films, and tonight's random choice was The Lion King, regarded by many as the greatest of all, and I can understand why, the story is brilliant, the music is superb and the animation holds up nicely. It's a good old fashioned Disney story of good and evil.Young and old will love this film, I love it so much that I saw the stage play, the live action film and a re release a few years back. Seeing this on the big screen was worth it, the landscapes were breathtaking.I had preconceived ideas that this film won a host of Oscars, when I checked it out, I noticed it won two, both for the music, I'm a little surprised. The music is tremendous, Hans Zimmer and Elton John, what better mix could anyone wish for?The humorous moments are sublime, Zazu is hilarious, Rowan Atkinson is an absolute joy, so sarcastic, so funny. Whoopi Goldberg is also perfect as Shenzi, again so funny.The voices fit each and every character, James Earl Jones and Matthew Broderick shone, it wouldn't have worked without Jeremy Irons, what a talent.This film cannot be given any other score than....10/10.

                                                               The Lion King is a classic from Disney. I remember going to the movie theater/cinema and watching the film...I was exactly 8 years old. And until now, with 19 years old, the good sensation of watching this movie is the same as that time. My mother even bought me Simba's doll! =)The story takes place in Africa, where Simba, son of Mufasa, is very well protected by his dad.(sometimes with the help of Zazu, a bird that is kind of a counselor of the king Mufasa)Everything goes well, but there is one problem: Scar, Mufasa's brother, is jealous because he is not the king of the jungle, and decides to do a plan to kill Simba and Mufasa. Simba escapes, but Mufasa dies; Scar tells Simba that he is guilty for Mufasa's death,and the terrified Simba runs away, too sad of what happened. Far from his kingdom, Simba meets Pumbaa and Timon, who takes care of him and teaches about Hakuna's Matata philosophy. Everything will be very well for a long time, until Simba meet again his childhood friend Nala ,who tells him about the horrible things Scar is doing in the old Kingdom.

film from their glorious renaissance period (1989-1999), and is undoubtedly worthy of such recognition. Notably, it is the highest rated Western animation on IMDb's own Top 250, which while flawed and imprecise is a good indicator of quality.A loose adaption of Shakespeare's Hamlet, The Lion King is visually stunning, the peak of hand-drawn animation, with a strong voice cast and a wide selection of memorable tunes. It is a tight ~80 minutes, and one sometimes forgets just how quick the movie moves, yet it does so deftly. The characters are well defined, and the arc of Simba's growth, the core of the film, evolves satisfyingly. One could question whether more time should have been spent on Simba's growth in the middle act (there is incredulous imagery as Simba grows exponentially next to the stasis of Timon and Pumba), but to meander so would ask it to be an entirely different film.While it is not uncommon for a side character or two overshadow the main (see the Genie in Aladdin), Matthew Broderick and Jonathan Taylor Thomas (adult and young Simba respectively) are at risk from nearly all of the phenomenal cast. James Earl Jones is a commanding presence, and Jeremy Irons as Scar steals every scene. The 'fools' of the film, be it Timon & Pumba, the Hyena trio or even Zazu, all provide the levity believably, that would otherwise leave an incredibly sombre film. Nala is powerful, though one must note that she seems at times far more capable than Simba to actually achieve anything. Nevertheless, Simba's coming-of-age arc, while predictable, is enjoyable, helped along by fantastic charisma and choice songs.The fact that the film has spawned a wildly successful musical gives a strong indication of the quality of the music, but what is less said is how beautiful the film is. As The Lion King was being released, works were already moving away from hand-drawn animation, with Toy Story released a year later. And The Lion King might be the peak of hand-drawn, with an enormous palate of creativity and variety. The opening vista for 'Circle of Life', the bursts of colour in 'Can't wait to be King' and the sombre tone of 'Be Prepared' all are gorgeous. Yet, special mention must go to the Stampede scene, one of the finest scenes of animation ever.One thing I've developed from multiple viewings is how Timon and Pumba might be the weakest part of the movie. First, their 'life lessons' are essentially reversed by Rafiki. Certainly they are qualified to the point of being narratively sidelined. They feel contrived and even a detraction from the meat of the movie. Their role is the fast food portion of the film- the quick fix over more meatier bits of the film. The entertainment provided is enjoyable regardless, and is essential to round off the movie as Disney.The Lion King is endlessly re-watchable, catchy, fun, while remaining a fantastic piece of cinema and an invaluable part of the Disney canon. Magnificent.

There's so much I can say about this movie but all my comments always come down to one thing: this movie is beautiful. Pure genius. A timeless story. I might be a little biased in my beliefs, seeing as the first movie I remember seeing in theatres is "The Lion King" and I still watch it on a regular basis and know all the words but I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who agree with what I have to say. "The Lion King" is beautiful; hands down, it is the best Disney film ever created.The story is something that everyone can relate to, whether they are a lion ;) or not. Simba is destined to become king one day and just can't wait to rule the throne; everyone can relate to wanting to grow up and become an adult, to do whatever they want and not have to worry about anything. His father tries to teach him that, despite the fact that he will one day be grown and king, his life will not be easy. Simba has to learn his lesson the hard way when his Uncle Scar, who, too, wants the throne, kills his father and convinces Simba that it was his fault. Suddenly, growing up doesn't seem so great anymore (I can *really* relate to that).And so, Simba flees his home and comes across Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts. They teach Simba the "Hakuna Matata" lifestyle, something that idealizes a life free of stress, worry and responsibility. Now, don't we all wish we could live this way? No worries for the rest of our days... But when Simba's childhood friend Nala returns, he realizes that he can't live Hakuna Matata forever, for he does have a responsibility to his pride and his homeland. Simba understands that he must grow up, as we all do, and does what's right.The songs are catchy and fit the movie well (the original songs, of course, though "The Morning Report" isn't too bad) and the score is haunting and beautiful. Along with the art work, the music captures the heart of Africa.With the types of shows that children watch these days (boy, doesn't that make me sound old?), it's a wonder they'll learn in virtues and values at all. "The Lion King" is a great teacher when it comes to learning lessons that will carry throughout their lifetime. "The Lion King" teaches children that it's all right to be a kid but you must understand and accept responsibility for things you can and cannot control. Everyone has a place in The Circle of Life and we must find it; the film also teaches that we will encounter bad and even terrible things during our lifetime but we must accept them and move on. These are important, meaningful lessons; heck, I even used them in my SAT essay! "The Lion King" is a film for every generation and is a powerful film that all children should see. I'm past my childhood now and I still watch it whenever I get the chance; I look forward to sharing it with my children.A timeless film!

all the characters and the story is incredible, great for all ages and I really recommend it to anyone who hasn't already watched it.

                                                                                                   This movie's story was written solely by Disney Studios, about a young lion, Simba, who was forced into exile by his evil Uncle Scar, who wants to take control of the jungle before Simba claims it. Life in the jungle declines under Scar's rule as Simba abandons his identity and meets new friends, Timon and Pumbaa, in another part of the jungle.Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff directed an exciting movie, adopting more of what I think are some of mainstream Hollywood's intense drama and comedy styles, seen in such parts like Uncle Scar and his crafty hyena goons chasing away poor Simba like gangsters pursuing a helpless hero, and the parts of the more modern day jokes and punchlines made by Timon and Pumbaa. The movie is also full of drama and action that will attract an audience of all ages, providing a great source of entertainment. It is compelling to see how Simba tries to wrestle his way out of his doubts as he tries to find his true identity and compelling to see Simba's family try to overcome adversary under Scar's rule. This is also a powerful story about courage, duty and identity (noticable as Simba tries to find his way) and the importance of family. Hans Zimmer did a good job on the music score and Elton John wrote some memorable songs like "Circle of Life" and "Can You Feel The Love Tonight." The toe-tapping "I Just Can't Wait To Be King" is my favorite.The characters are likable and, like the plot's style, take on more of a mainstream Hollywood approach. This movie differs from the more earlier films such as "Cinderella" and "The Jungle Book," and even the later films such as "The Little Mermaid" and "Beauty and the Beast." "The Lion King" doesn't have that Disney touch you've come to expect and love in many of the fairytale and adventure movies, signaling that Disney films have evolved immensely over time. Even though it's not one of the more conventional Disney films, "The Lion King" is still a very good movie to watch due to its original concept, captivating story and memorable characters.Grade B+

in language".No, I am not exaggerating! It is the best movie ever, whether in human form or in animated. I can't find a single flaw in The Lion King (1994). Someone could argue that the story is not original, Disney just twisted it. Someone could also argue that i didn't watch that much of movies to judge "The Best Ever" but as I said, this the best movie I ever saw. The story is nice and free flowing and without any unnecessary bumpers. One can not recognized the voices behind the characters, because the characters are so prominent. Music! Let me say I am not very fond of English pop songs, but I could hum almost most of the songs of this movie, so I would say, music is that nice. Animation is superb, landscapes are eye catching, dialogues are sharp and comedy is at its best. What more might I say?Beside everything, you can say how crazy I am about this movie by my name. Enjoy the movie, don't leave the seat. Hakuna Matata!

"The Lion King" is and will always will be regarded as one of the better Disney movies. And it deserves that!First of all the movie looks visually splendid! The African land scape's are beautiful and so are the animations of the animals itself.What makes "The Lion King" such a special movie is the emotional dept the story has. The story plays a significant role in the movie and it has some good adult moments. The entire movie has a more of an adult feeling, unlike earlier made Disney's that mainly focused on only young children. Still there also is plenty to enjoy for the young ones, especially the characters Timon and Pumbaa shall be loved by them.The story is filled with symbolism and reference to mainly the communist regime.The voice cast is good, mainly of course thanks to James Earl Jones who has an amazing good deep voice. Also the three hyenas are voiced perfectly by Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings. Jeremy Irons who voices the main villain Scar really brings his character to live and makes the movie even more worth watching.There are some typical Disney songs that are good. Also surprising good is the musical score itself composed by Hans Zimmer who also received an Oscar for it. His first and only one but hopefully not his last. Also Tim Rice and Elton John received an Oscar for the song " Can You Feel the Love Tonight" and were nominated for two other songs from this movie.A must see animated movie with some scene's and songs that you'll not easily forget.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

                   My favourite Disney movie of all time. I watched this again recently with my young children and I was just as gripped as when I watched it as a child myself.I found myself singing the songs with my daughter afterwards.The animation is truly wonderful. Although this film is 20 years old I'm not sure they could have made it any more impressive today. The full majesty of Africa, the terror and exhilaration of the wildebeest stampede, the colours and the sounds - it's exhilarating.The story is a fairly typical Disney one of a kid who loses his way before remembering what it means to have responsibility. But that's fine by me.This is a movie to make you feel good and re-live a child-like sense of awe and wonder.

He explains to his son, a young cub named Simba, that one day he will be the king... but before that he has a lot to learn. There are dangers, even for lions. The greatest danger comes from Simba's Uncle Scar; an embittered lion with a Machiavellian streak. Scar wants to rule but to do that he needs to rid himself of Mufasa and Simba... he has plans. One day Scar's plan works; Mufasa is dead and Simba leaves the Pride Lands believing he is to blame for his father's death. He grows up learning to take things easy with new friends Pumbaa and Timon, a warthog and meerkat. Scar now rules the pride with the help of the hyenas. When Simba learns of how bad things have got in the Pride Lands he will have to decide whether to continue the easy life or fight to make things better.This film is definitely one of Disney's classics; it has a fine story, some great characters and catchy songs. Simba is a decent protagonist even if the plot demands that he isn't too strong early on and Scar is a great villain; as are his trio of hyena acolytes. Given the film's 'U' certificate I was surprised at how dark it is in places; some scenes might disturb younger viewers as characters are often in real danger. The voice cast is very impressive; notably Jeremy Irons, as Scar, James Earl Jones, as Mufasa, and Rowan Atkinson, as Zazu the hornbill who is Mufasa's majordomo. As one would expect from Disney the animation and character designs are all really good. Overall I'd definitely recommend this for all but the youngest children and adults alike.

It had its funny moments its action it really is a perfect movie for the kids. And for the adults the acting was great and it had a very good story very predictable but not when I was a kid.This movie is about a young lion cub "Simba" who is tricked into thinking he was responsible for his fathers death so ridden with guilt he leaves the pride and goes off on his own.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Lion King was pretty much my favourite movie growing up. It was one of those movies I probably watched dozens of times between the age of 2 and 6, so much so I probably had the entire film committed to memory at some point. So I definitely had fond memories of it, and still felt a great deal of emotional attachment towards the film, but for a while I started thinking- is the movie actually any good? Or was it just overwhelming nostalgia telling me that the movie was better than it really is in cold, cynical, objective reality?I went and watched the film when it was re-released in cinemas back in 2011- in 3D, of course, which was resoundingly "meh," but the whole gimmicky 3D stuff didn't even matter. I was getting to see one of my most fondly remembered childhood films on the big screen, and it was kinda exciting. Of course, the excitement could have led me to be massively let down when viewing the film as an older and (slightly) more mature individual, but thankfully, to my relief, the movie was awesome. I enjoyed it just as much at 17 as I had enjoyed it at 4, and came to realise that the movie was indeed a great one. Nostalgia may have helped a bit, but I still think from a more objective standpoint this is a damn great film- almost certainly my favourite animated movie of all time.Of course it's hard to pick a favourite animation film in a universe where Pixar exists. My pick for my favourite animation film could easily go to almost any of Pixar's masterpieces, but I guess I just feel a bit more connected to The Lion King. There's definitely something very special about it, but it's all a bit tough to put into words.I guess all I can really say is that it's a movie that's just fundamentally effective. Does that make sense? I don't know. There's just so many good components of this movie, and they all come together so well to deliver an extremely satisfying experience.For starters, the story is a fantastic one, dealing with themes of fate, death, pride, betrayal, and other things you don't usually see in a kid's film. The film can get pretty dark at times, but thankfully never to an overwhelming extent, because this does have to be child accessible after all. And I'm also thankful for the fact this movie's not all doom and gloom because it allows for some great humour. I still think Timon and Pumba are a hilarious duo- if you told me you thought they were annoying as hell, I wouldn't argue, but for some reason they never got on my nerves and I found them hysterical. Oh, and Rowan Atkinson as the frequently abused bird servant Zazu is fantastic.That's another thing worth mentioning- the voice acting. It's great across the board, and serious props has to go to whoever helped cast this movie, as there were some incredibly great choices here. Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones... even Matthew Broderick is perfectly suited to his character.The animation and the overall look of the film is brilliant too. There's so much colour in this movie, and it really didn't need a gimmicky 3D conversion for one to become completely immersed in the film's world.And yeah, the music needs a mention too. I know everybody loves all the really memorable songs from the movie, and I imagine I'm not the only person who will never forget the particularly catchy ones (I'm looking at you 'I just can't wait to be king'), but I think more credit needs to go to Hans Zimmer's brilliant score. Zimmer is maybe one of the most praised composers still working today, and while I often find his music works very well with the movies he writes it for, the pieces of music themselves are usually kind of underwhelming to listen to by themselves. However, his score for The Lion King I think is absolutely brilliant, and I also believe his instrumental stuff is just as good as the undeniably catchy and more well-known Elton John songs.So, just watch this movie. You don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. Who says animated films are only for kids anyways?

The plot, characters, themes, music, emotions and tension are something else. It's truly a classic you will love as a kid and appreciate years later as an adult. A must watch.

                                               The Lion King was the best Disney film of 1994, and perhaps for a few years after. We all know Disney's been hashing up cheap tricks for kids-dumb sequels like Lady and the Tramp 2, Cinderella 2, all that stuff recently. But the Lion King was great, and the all star cast including: Rowan Atkinson, Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones really help this film too! Great animation, story, and characters. The Lion King's a great film!3.5/5 STARS-JOHN ULMER

2019 TLK Summer Blockbuster live action version on the worst of list in December.Still here in autumn 2013 the reviews are still coming in.Back then in Christmas 1994 I saw the movie in the cinema, and came back many times for this movie.The movie deserved some Oscars for use of sound.An all star cast are included with names like Whoopi Goldberg that suits her role as the crazy hyena Shenzi.Jeremy Irons does what he can to play the powerful villain that get what he deserved by being assaulted by the hyenas he had control over.Back at the beginning of the movie we see Simba the lion being raised with his family.But Simba's uncle Scar wants to kill Simba's father that is the king.Simba must flee after his father is killed under a wildebeest stampede.Now it's up to Simba as older later on to get revenge on Scar.This is a classic Disney movie with something for everyone.Songs both dark and playful, thrills and funny scenes.10/10

                       Yes, definitely my favorite hand drawn animated movie of all time. It was my favorite as a child and it still is now. This is an epic and cult tale based loosely on Shakespeare's Hamlet. Set in between Kenya or Tanzania, Africa at an unknown time, the king and queen of pride rock christen their son, Simba, as the new prince. His uncle, Scar (Jeremy Irons), however, longs for the throne, so he conjures up several plans with the hyenas to get rid of the king Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Simba. The first one doesn't work, but in the second he is half successful. Luring Simba in a stampede of wilder-beasts (The goose bump-giving score by Hans Zimmer as powerful as ever at this point) Scar gets Mufasa to save him but then, as the king climbs to the top of a rock, Scar claws him and releases him. Simba then finds his father's dead body on the ground, and while mourning him, his uncle arrives, and convinces him it was his own fault, sending him away, with the hyenas on his tail to finish him off. Simba escapes everything and runs far away. He almost dies in the desert but is then rescued by meerkat Timon (Nathan Lane) and Warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) who teach him to adapt to a sort of hippie life of good times and bug eating. Now grown, Simba (Matthew Broderick) has a run in with Nala (Moira Kelly) his childhood friend, while she hunts Pumbaa. They fall in love and she tries to convince him to go back, but he refuses. Later, while in the grasslands, he meets up with the baboon that christened him, Rafiki, and he leads him out to speak with the ghost of his father, who reminds him of who he really is and what he must do. He speeds off back to his kingdom, now degrading under the false king, to reclaim his throne and set peace to Pride Rock.I couldn't give my opinion about this film without explaining the plot, if you'll forgive me. It really is a Disney classic that's unique in so many ways. The scene in which Simba tries to wake his dead father is horribly tragic, but extremely powerful. Disney already did something similar with Bambi, with the implication that the protagonist's mother had been killed. But it had never reached to the extent that the audience saw the death or the dead body of one of the parents. The Lion King is a 100 times more powerful than Bambi. Even though I never cried at that scene, I was always very uncomfortable with it. The script is also really cool and witty and should have been nominated for the 1994 Academy Awards, along with the winner Pulp Fiction.

The story is classic, but better yet are both the stunning animation and the inspirational score by Hans Zimmer. The songs are brilliantly written with music by Elton John (with help from Zimmer) and Lyrics by Andrew Lloyd Webber's long-time partner, Tim Rice.

With Disney on such a high expectations were, while this was increased by the superb vocal talent and wonderful animation, and for many those expectations were met. Though a lot are going to disagree with me, I have to come out and say that I think the film is kind of overrated. That doesn't mean I dislike it as a matter of fact I agree that it does have fantastic elements, but for the heaps of praise it gets I'm not sure if it holds up well enough.The story is effectively a toned down Hamlet. A lion prince named Simba is born, meaning that his cruel uncle Scar is now second in line to the throne. Scar plots to kill both King Mufasa and Simba, succeeding in killing Mufasa and making Simba believe he was at fault. Simba flees the kingdom and remains in exile for a number of years, until figures of the past challenge him and he must return home to take his rightful place as king. The story is a very interesting one, it is a much more mature than you would expect from Disney and I really enjoy it for that reason. Everything that happens seems to happen for a reason and there isn't any filler as far as the plot goes. After all this is a very big story and telling it in a cohesive mature manner works very well.The other impressive feature is the animation. It's clear that the animators put a lot of work in to create such a visually pleasing place for this to all happen in. The colours used give the place such a bright beautiful look and it is actually quite authentic looking too. Scenes of bird flying over the vivid landscape or of the sun shining over the land are so beautiful to look at. The character designs were also very good, like the contrast between the powerful Mufasa and the slimy Scar. The sheer scope of things is another wonderful aspect, such as when Scar's paw first comes down or the later Wildebeest stampede. Even things like the backgrounds look massive which gives an extra size to this world.The characters are rather hit and miss. Simba is a bit of a bland lead, he is just a kid for most of it but he does come off as a bit too boring and even obnoxious at times. He doesn't get any better the older he gets and Matthew Broderick's voice only adds to the dullness. Mufasa is just a brilliant character. He is designed wonderfully, has some really interesting characteristics and James Earl Jones' booming voice is perfect for it. A lot of people rate Scar as a top villain yet for me he's just decent. He is enjoyably devious and Jeremy Irons clearly has fun with the role, but he does come off as not that smart and a bit snivelling in the end. Zazu is very funny with Rowan Atkinson delivering some good lines and Rafiki is also very likable for coming across as a good friend. I'm not a big fan of Timon and Pumbaa as they come off as a bit annoying and wink at the camera too much, though they do have some amusing scenes. The Hyenas were daft but entertaining, while I think Nala was underplayed too much.I do have issues with the film. The message that it is trying to get across is an interesting one in how we must learn from the past to move forward. The problem is that when Simba confronts his past nobody believes him until Scar says what really happened. Looking at this you can't help but feel Simba would have been better off lying and that harms the whole point of the message. Also I think a lot of the comedic elements feel very misplaced. For a story as grand and serious as this I can't help but find that the comedy is too trivial at times which is distracting. As mentioned Timon and Pumbaa just feel a bit misplaced because they're jokes are slightly too silly. If done well, like with Zazu or the hyenas antics, then its nice relief but otherwise it doesn't work.Also I really find that the songs are a mixed bag. 'I Just Can't Wait to be King' and 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' just come off as your typical pop songs and there isn't anything truly catchy or memorable about them. 'Hakuna Matata' is another one everyone loves, but for me it's just annoying. On the other hand however, 'Circle of Life' is a brilliantly grand number that opens the film perfectly and 'Be Prepared' is really catchy with some very enjoyable singing from Jeremy Irons. Elsewhere there are some really memorable sequences here. The circle of life opening is something that everyone should remember, the wildebeest chase is visually stunning as well as pulse-pounding, Simba talking to Mufasa in the clouds is sadly beautiful and the final battle sequence does have some great images. Also I thought it was very brave decision to actually show the body of Mufasa after his death. In fact going on from that the movie does have a very strong emotional core running throughout that is very welcoming and smartly used.On the whole I do think that The Lion King is a very accomplished piece from Disney, I just don't find it as engaging as most people do. This is a big story with a lot of big elements, I just find that whilst most of the work some of them aren't quite as successful. I do wish other Disney films were as acclaimed as The Lion King, but I still find an entertaining and well-made film.

Maybe the hype surrounding it gave me greater expectations, who knows? I thought it was a good plot, (although an overused plot in movies)and some of the characters were really good. But I found parts of the movie boring and the music not up to Disney standards. Elton John got an Oscar I believe, but can't see why.Best parts of the movie are the interactions between Simba and Scar. In fact I thought that Jeremy Irons performance was outstanding.The animation was pretty hit and miss I thought.So sorry TLK fans but I wasn't thrilled by this movie.

to try not to be too biased here...I'm going to compose myself the best I can...But, I'm not going to lie, that's going to be really hard seeing as though I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE!!! I know a lot of people say this film is overrated and all that jazz, but LOOK AT THIS FILM and tell me you don't love it too!ANIMATION: Spectacular! This movie looks great! Of course it has an epic, grand quality about it, and the animation really takes it to another level! The stampede scene has got to be one of the biggest scenes ever put to traditional animation!SONGS/MUSIC: This movie brings us the Tim Rice/Elton John team. Even though there's no Alan Menken or Howard Ashman, these songs are still great! They fit the movie's tone, they're not out of place, and they are ALL memorable! This Disney movie has the best soundtrack - there is no Number One hit song from this film - ALL the songs are Number One! I don't just love the songs, but I am in mad love with Hans Zimmer's score! It's beautiful! It tells the story and fits the mood perfectly! The main theme, "Lea Halalela," is fan-frickin-tastic! Gosh, if that theme were a woman, I'd marry her! But the music is what takes us to Africa (which country are we in? I don't know...), and if it weren't for Lebo M's contributions, NO music in this movie would be great!ROMANCE: For as much as I love this movie, I have to admit that this is one of the weak aspects of the film. I love the "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" number; I love the song, and I love looking at the animation. But...why is the song here? Why is this scene here? First of all, it doesn't match the story at all. It feels like the scene takes place because...Disney movies have romance scenes! Secondly, I don't believe Simba and Nala are in love. Look at how other Disney films show love: characters are smiling, singing, happy, and would do anything to be with their romantic interest. Here, Simba and Nala are arguing and yelling at each other after the scene. I'll tell you what, though, if you look at Nala as she's laying on her back during the song number, look at how she looks at Simba. That says, "I want you, lion man."CHARACTERS: I am in love with these characters! Much like the "Beauty and the Beast" gang, there's not a person...or animal...in this movie I don't dislike! My two favorite characters are Mufasa and Rafiki. Mufasa wreaks of power! The reason we hate Scar so much is because he kills Mufasa, who we love so much! He is the father of Disney movie fathers - Disney fathers period! He says one of my favorite lines: "Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become." OOOH, that line just OOZES power - just BLEEDS power!!! Rafiki is awesome because he is both funny and wise. He knows just what to say and just what to do for the right moment. He has funny lines like "It means you are a baboon, and I am not!" Yet he knows when to hit Simba over the head with a stick and tell him to learn from his mistakes. Go Rafiki!STORY: I think the story is excellent. I love watching it, I love watching Simba's arc, I think it is brilliant...Though, there's one other problem the movie has that lies in the story. After Mufasa dies and Simba cries over his body, Scar comes and tells him to run away. Question: if they're all alone, why doesn't Scar just kill Simba himself? At first I thought it was because he didn't want Simba's blood on his hands, but that can't be right. First of all, he has Mufasa's blood on his hands. Second of all, he has a violent fight with Simba at the end of the movie. If Scar wants the throne so badly that he puts together an attack against two children, a Nazi team of hyenas, and a wildebeest stampede, I don't think he was above killing a child. The movie could have been over just like that; why didn't he kill Simba? The only reason I can come up with is "If he killed him, there'd be no movie." Well, that's weak. If that's the case, then the movie didn't need to happen. We should have gotten a better reason for the following events that took place.CONCLUSION: Despite the two problems I have with the movie, I still adore it! It's epic, it's dramatic, it's funny, it's musical! It is large! It has one of the saddest moments ever in Disney. It is one of the studio's biggest movies for a reason!

brave decision to have its first cinematic trailer consisting entirely of the opening sequence of the film. It's a decision that highlighted the enormous strength and beauty of that opening scene where the animals of the Pridelands gather for the coronation of young Simba while the iconic Circle of Life accompanies his introduction. It's a gorgeous spectacle of animation and music which immediately grips the audience's attention and establishes the setting. The cell-shaded 2D animation of the wide range of animals combines easily with the matte painted backgrounds which add visual depth and beautiful scenery in likes of waterholes, mountain ranges, lush forests and waterfalls. The foreground and background blend seamlessly and the world of The Lion King is endlessly alive and breathing even with its limited selection of camera movements. It's at once more inviting than the relatively sterile 3D environments of some more modern Disney works (Big Hero 6 comes to mind). The film's soundtrack is similarly impressive. Elton John and Tim Rice combine to bring five original songs that still draw applause, recognition and sing-a-longs even two decades later. The opening Zulu choral vocals of The Circle of Life are powerful and evocative, while the animated choreography that combines with I Just Can't Wait to Be King makes for a jaunty upbeat tune. Hans Zimmer's score goes from strength to strength, drawing upon traditional African choral themes and percussion which resonates during the film's emotional moments. The voice acting is unique and enduring. The booming bass tones of James Earl Jones makes for a imposing father figure in Mufusa, in contrast to Jeremy Irons' Scar, rich with haughty disdain for his pride-mates. A fun filled exile in the middle of the film is characterised by that of the jovial Timon and Pumbaa, while young Simba's voice grows into the deeper tones of Matthew Broderick, during an excellent and colour filled montage over Hakuna Matata. The three hyena cronies of Scar are also distinct despite their ugly cloned appearances, boasting the voice work of Whoopi Goldberg, Marin and Cummings as the overly enthusiastic, sassy and hot-headed henchmen. The story is a simple if not effective one, drawing upon similar themes from Hamlet. It's a tale of Simba's quest for redemption and revenge after being falsely exiled for his father's death. The traditional coming of age plot is well paced and is earmarked by several deeply emotional moments, the most significant of those being Simba's grief at the realisation of his father's death (Jonathan Taylor Thomas's voice acting in this scene is heartbreaking). There's plenty of emotional depth in the portrayal of Simba through the themes of ostracization, loss, guilt and growing up which makes this film appropriate for both adult and children alike. The Lion King has a rightful place in Disney's elite as a vibrant, poignant and visually immersive film.

                                                      I first heard of this wonderful Disney feature when I popped in the Aladdin tape, and I knew it was going to be my favorite. A year later, I saw it in a theatre as a double feature paired with Angels in the Outfield. It was so good I did not want to see it come to an end. I begged to see it again and I got my chance at a library and it was just as mesmerizing. I finally got it on video and to this day it never fails to impress. With gorgeous animation, memorable characters, unbelievable score, and a well thought out story with a great message for anyone of any age ("We are all connected in the the great circle of life", said Mufasa), what's not to like? My favorite song is Hakuna Matata (of course!) but I have many of these songs stuck in my head from time to time. To top it all off, I recently saw the Broadway musical and you owe it to yourself to see it.Hakuna Matata!

                                             All credit where it's due, on a technical level, THE LION KING is a very well put-together movie. The colors are vivid, the character's movements are fluid, and it's just a very pretty movie to look at. I give this movie a bad rap all the time, but even I have to admit this. My problem is that it's been unbelievably overblown for twenty years. Disney marketing got it into their heads that this is some sort of high prestige experience; bigger than all their other animated fluff, and warranting of blind praise from everyone. It's impenetrable for me because I haven't been able to listen to the soundtrack for two decades (and the movie's big on its music). 1994 radio was saturated with both the Elton John songs and the Simba numbers, and I haven't been able to hear any of it again since. For a musical, that's kind of a deal- breaker.Story-wise, it definitely works better when you're a kid. The characters aren't obnoxious and Simba's reckoning isn't shallow. But it's just such nauseating material. The whole thing's built on pomp and spectacle, but there's nothing underneath. 3/10

beautifully told.I wish Disney was able to make films like this in the modern day of age, instead of focusing only in brand-type films.

And while that term has been used or rather missused over at least the last couple of years or decade(s), this is one of those times it really fits. The movie is an animated fairy tale, that is also a bit grim at times. Still this is the circle of life ... and has so many memorable songs. Listening to the audio commentary, you come to realize how many things were in the balance while making this. How many things that are being considered genius now, were last minute decisions or things that they were doubting themselves (or the studio did).So it is a fine line, between making somethinng reat and failing at making something at all. Fortunately for us (and Disney of course) they really hit the ball out of the park (which is a baseball metaphor as I understand and is something good). This being so short (considereing the additional 30 minutes I think of the remake), make it a fast and enjoyable ride.Apart from the fine animation (the remale looks photorealistic and can almost not be considered animation, both look awesome), you have fantastic voice actors. This is true for both films, but it was way more difficult in the 90s to convince actors to lend their voice to an animated movie. Known "regular" actors that is, because apparently it was all an imaging/marketing thing for them too. Which is understandable - but anyone who didn't get on board with this, might have many regrets now. Good thing they were able to convince the cast they ended up using. The voices add to the overall feeling.There is something for the whole family here - and hopefully you can see that too - no pun intended

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I must have missed something because I just don't get the love for this movie. First, I have too many questions. This pride (much larger than a normal pride) has a huge amount of lionesses, but only two male lions. So who is Nala's Father? Either Mufasa or Scar, which makes her Simba's sister or cousin, and their romance a little disturbing, but I guess that doesn't matter in the lion world. Then after Scar is gone, I guess Simba is the only male? I know, I'm overly analytical, but details like this bother me. I find it hard to believe Mufasa didn't realize how much Scar hated him, and didn't take more precautions around him. All that aside, James Earl Jones is the perfect voice for Mufasa and Jeremy Irons is perfect as Scar. Rowen Atkinson as Zazu, Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi, Cheech Marin as Banzai, Robert Guillaume as Rafiki, and the wonderful Nathan Lane as Timon all do a perfect job. Unfortunately I have a problem with Matthew Broderick as Simba. I love Matthew and he's a great actor, but to me his voice just wasn't the right choice for Simba. The music also leaves me cold; none of the songs are memorable and I really hate "Can You Feel the Love Tonight". Sorry Sir Elton, but it's so syrupy and cheesy it makes me gag. This story has one of the most heart-wrenching death scenes of any Disney movie with Mufasa's death, and Scar's death, although not shown, has severe implied violence; all a little much for young kids. It's an okay movie but not one of my favorites.

He grows up carefree and merry with friends Timon and Pumbaa but when he comes of age, he finds himself unable to ignore his responsibility as the lion king, especially when his father's pride has been driven to such a miserable state by his uncle.The score by Hans Zimmer and songs by Elton John and Tim Rice greatly contribute to this movie's unforgettable charm.

The story is heartfelt, the animation beautiful, and songs fun. The lion king is a childhood favorite and I can't think of a way it could be better.

with "The Lion King," a very nice animated film.It is about Simba, a young lion whose father was Mufasa, the original king of the Pride Lands. That opening scene where Rafiki broke open the gourd, made a mark on Simba's head with the juice and dust and lifted him towards the sun from Pride Rock is the most recognizable scene of the movie, because that's how it all began. As Simba had grown up, he had to learn about his issues in life, try to stay away from trouble (that scene where Mufasa and Simba had a long talk "SIMBA, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU, etc." TOTALLY taught Simba a lesson; after that was the whole "Look at the stars" thing), and later, as a wildebeest stampede, started by Scar, killed Simba's father, now Simba had to grow up all alone and try to figure this whole thing out all by himself.Later, Simba was lost in the desert with vultures and stuff, and here, enter Timon and Pumbaa. This recognizable phrase, Hakuna Matata, started to change Simba's life, as well as moviegoers', forever! Then we see Simba, Pumbaa, and Timon (with his funny walk) walk across the log in the night, with Simba becoming an adult! Simba then had fallen in love with Nala, and later on, when Simba was worried, Rafiki had come to him, told Simba to look in the water, and Simba decided to return to Pride Rock to become king.Pride Rock was a bad wasteland; how sad was that. Suddenly, Simba realized that Scar killed Mufasa, and so, they battled on Pride Rock with a fire below!!!!! Simba won, and all was restored, and that beginning scene? This time, with Simba and Nala, we see it again, and thus ends the movie."The Lion King" is a terrific film. It had memorable scenes, good lessons, and nothing but Disney Magic. I've seen this in the movies in '94 and the re-release in '95, we had the video for some time, and this played on the Old Disney Channel in the late 90s. Go watch it; I think your life will change forever.10 out of 10

                        Is there anyone who didn't love this film? Besides the one sentence/one-star reviews that always bring a film down these days? Probably one of Disney's greatest animated films ever, easily surpassing the many before it and many after it. The story is dynamic and much more involving than alas "Cinderella", "Beauty and the Best", and plenty of others that I not need say. Many Disney films seem to me oh so similar in premise and characters, this one stand s out as a truly unique and very different tale. And with the voice talents of Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Rowan Atkinson, plus many, many others, the characters seemed much more human to me than the repeated after repeated princess in distress who is best friends with nature as well\u0085.how dull! And to think these are merely anthropomorphic animals, how ironic. In my humble opinion, this also Matthew Broderick's best performance ever.And as if having Hans Zimmer score the film wasn't a grand achievement in itself, Elton John and Tim Rice add to the score beautifully. The end result is a tale so epic if you look at it from a glance it evokes the scope of a Greek tragedy. In fact, amongst the many over-rated Disney Renaissance era films, this is one of the few where I can watch it again and again without ever tiring of it.

Difficult to deny the worldwide success of this Disney animated musical from which already has sprung a sequel, a theatrical show and now, we hear a live-action remake in the near future. And yet watching it for the first time, I'd be lion sorry, lying if I said I thought it was top drawer Disney. I've liked Elton John's music too for many years too but again didn't feel the songs he contributed (with Tim Rice as his lyricist) were his best work even if it did give his career an unexpected boost at the time.So what's not to like...well I struggled a little to side with the ruling Mafusa who when asked why it was okay for lions to eat antelopes, lamely proffered the line that lions turn back into grass when they die which then feeds the antelopes as part of the circle of life...that's not my understanding about evolution in the animal kingdom, where I thought survival of the fittest was the raison d'etre. I know the film is almost 25 years old but I also thought the animation quality wasn't of the highest while the characters repeat stock situations and emotions which Disney still peddles today, i.e. rebellious youngster leaves home before returning to heroically save the day against big bad baddie, in this case Simba's uncle Scar. Oh and of course there are cute side-attractions a-plenty, like the meerkat that thinks it's Groucho Marx, his less-than-sharp wild boar sidekick that definitely isn't a pig and a witch doctor funky gibbon all helping Simba in some way or other. I didn't really think the hyenas who support Scar were especially malevolent either.Maybe I'm just an old stick-in-the-mud but I just didn't think "The Lion King" lived up to expectations. No worries though or as they say in the film Hakuna Matata.

                     this Disney film was probably the most ambitious undertaking by the studio up to that time.the amount of animated sequences are astounding and the detail equally so.so from a technical stand point it's brilliant.and the content of the movie is great as well.the story is wonderful.and unlike many earlier Disney animated movies movies,the villain in this movie is much less evil,and the movie is suitable for most ages.there are a few intense scenes though,and a scene dealing with ***possible minor spoiler***the loss(death)of a character.other than that,though,it should

emotional, fun and heart felt movie.The music, singing story were heartfelt. The characters were Gold. All of them are memorable from Simba to the Rhino that sat on Zazu to The Hyenas.\nThis movie made you laugh and feel sad. The death of Mufasa really made you sad.The only flaw I can say is the sequels that I have yet to see look bad and Lion King 2019 is very awful.Stick to this one movie and you are set for life.Update Feb 28 2021: I just saw Lion King 2 after 22 years and 8161 days, and I was wrong the sequel was really good.

                  The Lion King is the movie that will be honored fro the next thousand years. It's really that good! The movie starts with young Simba being shown to the rest of the world by this old monkey. As the movies goes on, King Mufasa is murdered by his own brother Scar. Scar also banishes Simba from the kingdom. In exile, Simba meets a warthog and a meercat. When Simba becomes an adult, he ventures back home to take on Scar and his hyena sidekicks. Even by today standards, this film has very good animation. Disney always does a good job with animation. The songs and score is excellent and praise-worthy. My favorite songs are "Circle of Life" and "Hakuna Matata." The voice acting is full of brand-name talent such as James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, and Whoopi Goldberg. I do think that this movie is too violent for a G rating. It should be rated PG. Overall, an excellent family classic! I rate this movie 10/10.

of the savanna. Directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, two veterans of Disney, featured several well-known actors to the voices of the English version, as Matthew Broderick (adult Simba), James Earl Jones (Mufasa), Jeremy Irons (Scar, the villain) Rowan Atkinson (Zazu, the king's collaborator) and Whoopi Goldberg (Shenzi, one of the hyenas).It is one of the biggest hits in the history of Disney studios so far, a magical film that tells a story of a young cub who, after being victim of a tragedy and family hatreds, goes in search of his place in the world. And he will have the help of two of the most beloved Disney characters: Timon and Pumba, an unlikely (a meerkat and a warthog) but inseparable pair of friends. The songs of this movie were written and composed by Tim Rice, Sir Elton John and Hans Zimmer. Some of them have become big hits which are still remembered and sung, especially "I Just Can not Wait To Be King", "Hakuna Matata" and "Can you feel the love tonight".For all this reasons, "The Lion King" is a timeless film which will be seen and remembered by generations children and adults, while there is cinema.

review, seeing that so many people seem to think it's this amazing animated experience. Well, this is just my opinion, you can like it or leave it, to each their own and I only hope I never have to watch this thing ever again.I only ever saw The Lion King twice, both times were involuntary. The first time, I was six years old, sitting in a movie theater with my parents and eating this nasty bright yellow popcorn. So, the movie began, and I nearly fell asleep sitting through the annoying intro music and strange "lion birth ritual" thing with this wizzled up monkey holding up a lion to the sun (by that point I was hoping the monkey would drop the lion off the cliff but sadly not all wishes come true). For the next little while there was some dopey singing that I'm surprised didn't give the whole audience brain damage, and this scene with these freaky drunk-looking hyenas (I was six, it freaked me the hell out back then). Next thing I know the father lion gets killed, which shocked all the kids in the audience, many parents carried their screaming and crying children out of the theater by that point, mine included. Thank you mom and dad, you saved my childhood.Recently my friend dragged me along to see it again at her house (she's a huge Disney fan, I'm more of an X-Files and Cold Case person). She kept on saying, "isn't this a masterpiece? It's so breathtaking!" and all I could do was try to block my mind of the two annoying singing animals (a pig and a squirrel-thing) who were on-screen singing this bizarre new-agey song thing and they adopted the baby lion, god knows why. Well, I told her exactly what I thought of The Lion King, and it involved many swear words. Her comeback to me was: "You only hate it because it's Disney, you just don't understand its amazing moments!" Alright, true, I'm not a big fan of Disney, I think it's a load of commercialized, always happy garbage that stupefies children. That being said, there are a few Disney films I didn't mind: Alice In Wonderland (the 1950's cartoon version), Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, The Beauty and The Beast, Monster's Inc., Toy Story, The Aristocats and Oliver & Company are the few Disney films I've seen and thought were okay."You hate it because of the singing!" was her next argument.Well yeah, the songs in this movie were terrible, that goes without saying. But it would be dumb to hate a movie based primarily on its soundtrack."You hate it because it's popular!" she said then.Harry Potter, Goosebumps, The X-Files, Criminal Minds, Cold Case, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Romero's Living Dead films, those films/TV shows are extremely popular and I love them! The Lion King is just stupid, plain and simple."Okay, then you hate the actors," she concluded, looking unsure of herself at this point. (I just wanted to go home).I have nothing against the voice actors, they weren't bad (my all-time favorite actor, William B. Davis, has never been in any Disney movies, thank god).In my opinion, The Lion King was just a stupid movie and a waste of time, nobody has to agree with me. But I'd say it deserves 3/10 stars, definitely not the 8.5/10 stars it currently has.

                                                                                                                                                                                          Disney's The Lion King capped a highly lucrative 5 years for the House of Mouse, who were, before The Little Mermaid came along in 1989 and turned their fortunes around, in real danger. It seems ridiculous to think that the studio that now routinely make billions of dollars a year with their Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm output, as well as their recent fondness for re-imagining their so-called 'Disney Animated Classics' series in live-action, could have ever been in danger of actually going under. Yet Mermaid made the millions, Beauty and the Beast (1991) won critical adoration, and Aladdin (1992) charmed, and the rest is history.I remember seeing The Lion King in cinemas back in 1994 with my mum, and not being particularly over-awed. I didn't shed a tear when Mufasa was betrayed, nor was I singing the songs to myself in the car ride home. However, it felt like I was the only one, as the film's popularity seemed to increase each year, with home release re- masters, soundtracks and a theatre production jamming every one of my senses, even now, 22 years later. It was because of this, and partially because I'm an old-school (1930's-60's) Disney loyalist, that I shunned The Lion King for all these years. After finally viewing it again, I wish I had a time machine to slap the 10 year old version of myself, as this is about as close to animated perfection as you can get.For anyone who has somehow never seen the film, The Lion King tells the story of King Mufasa (James Earl Jones), a respected and formidable beast who rules over the Pride Lands of Africa. The arrival of his new son and heir, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Matthew Broderick), is cause for celebration across the plains, except, that is, for Mufasa's weak and envious brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) and his hyena friends (Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings). When Scar's plan to usurp Mustafa's throne ends in tragedy, Simba flees with guilt and shame, finding unlikely friends in the slow-witted warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) and motor-mouthed meerkat Timon (Nathan Lane). As Scar's rule leaves Simba's former homeland a hyena-ridden wasteland, will the would-be king fulfil his destiny and take back his crown?From the enchanting, wordless opening scene in which Simba is shown off to the crowd to the tune of Circle of Life, to the savage, expressionistic climax which sees hero and villain have their final showdown, I felt completely immersed in this world, regardless of the fact that I knew the story back to front. This is Disney at its most thoughtful, magical and hilarious. Perhaps taking a page from Studio Ghibli's environmentally-aware book, the film shows a real respect for the natural world despite anthropomophising its characters and dabbling in pseudo-mysticism. Lane and Sabella shine as Timon and Pumbaa, two of Disney's most beloved comedic side- kicks, who also get to belt out one of their most beloved tunes in Hakuna Matata. I'll most likely never be convinced that Disney will manage to recreate the beauty and warmth of the likes of Dumbo (1940) and Bambi (1942) during their Golden Age, but The Lion King is the closest it's ever come.

               A young lion cub named Simba is born, knowing that he will be the future king of the jungle. But after he is tricked into thinking that he killed his own father, the young cub runs away and goes into exile. When he grows older, he is forced to come back.It's pretty much common knowledge that Lion King is one of the best movies Disney has ever made. It embodies everything that makes Disney so great – excellent story, great characters, strong soundtrack, and a very capable cast of actors lending their voices.For me, the story is the best thing. Hamlet is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, and the writers have done a great job of transferring that to the animal kingdom. The scene between Simba and the ghost of Mufasa, in particular, is very emotional and tugs at the heart-strings. I'm surprised that the film was as short as it was, to be honest, I think it could have been fleshed out a little more. But what we do get is great.Simba also probably ranks up there as one of Disney's greatest creations. It is a brilliantly-crafted character, very well-voiced by Matthew Broderick. As a kid, I remember how beloved Timon and Pumbaa were, but I didn't really see the appeal. Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Scar (Jeremy Irons) are also very good. Coincidentally, 'The Lion King' marks the first time a major Disney character dies, which once again re-establishes the strength of the story.My only gripe with this movie is probably just the length. A little more time and the film could have been even better. But between the emotion, the brilliant songs ('Circle Of Life' is my personal favourite) and the fun characters, you have a classic. Not just a Disney classic, but a cinema classic.I'll stop masturbating now.

It is highly moving and one of the most emotional films that I have ever seen.Simba is a young lion who is the heir apparent as King of the pridelands to his father Mufasa. However his evil Uncle Scar wants to be king. When tragedy hits Simba, he leaves the pridelands despite the fact that it is his destiny to be the next king.As far as animation goes, this is legendary. All of the animals look like they do in real life. The scenery is amazing.The songs are good also, not nearly to the level of Aladdins songs, but pretty good. However the non singing music in the background is outstanding.As far as villains go, I think Scar has to be one of the most evil. He is an evil lion who alligns with HYENAS!!!! In case you are not well informed as far as animals go, Hyenas and Lions are bitter enemies who hate each other. The idea of a lion turning his back on lion kind and alligning with hyenas is unthinkable. One of the most evil villains who does help make a great conflict.All of the characters are great. Especially Mufasa, voiced by legendary James Earl Jones. The lessons that he tries to teach his son are phenomenal and ones that envoke a lot of emotion. This film has a lot of moments that are tremondously moving and make me want to cry at parts. Also it has the saddest moment in movie history in my opinion, I wont give it away though.As far as voice acting goes, this film has the best cast to my knowledge. Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Johnathon Taylor Thomas, and many other great voices.Easily one of the best films that I have ever seen. Highly recommended.

my favourite animated Disney movie ever. It has a good plot, good storyline, good characters and good villains. This movie is a must see for any kid and I'm sure a lot of adults enjoy this movie too. Basically its about a lion cub simba who is future king of the pride lands but his uncle scar wants to be king and so forms a plot to kill simba he doesn't succeed in killing simba but instead kills simbas father. Scar convinces simba that it is his fault his father died to simba feeling upset and guilty runs away. Some scenes are funny and some are sad. This is a movie I could watch over and over simply because its a great movie as I have already said a must see for anyone especially Disney fans. I give this movie an 8 out of 10

It spoke to me as nothing less than a majestic adventure. Beautifully done on every level; from the music by Elton John or the whole story. I normally do not care for musical numbers, but these were excellent enough to draw me in. James Earl Jones does excellent voice work as Simba's proud and powerful father. It is more dramatically staged than any previous animated film and still remains a powerful work of art to this very day. Even amongst films in general, this one still holds its own as a classic and I think it will remain very powerful for a long stretch of time.

          This is one of the famous Disney movies but to be honest, it didn't impress me. I think I've watched this movie just once and it's enough.I think this movie set voice actors to the famous actors so it just got so much attention.Your closest person who looks like your best friend may be a real enemy. And I agree with that.

                                                         There are a million other Disney movies that are sooo much better than this one! This movie is just boring all throughout. Also,i felt it was too scary for children. It made my little cousins cry. The songs were bad in my opinion. I hated every character, and i really didn't care what happened to them, really i just wanted this movie to end! Disney is capable of so much more, which I saw in 2015 Cinderella! That Beats out this any day of the week. There just wasn't anything for me in this movie, very bland and boring. I really don't know what else to say about it, it was bland and poor! I'm giving The Lion King a 3/10 for being a poor attempt at a family film by Disney.

                                                          King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi have a new son Simba. Mufasa's younger brother Scar is jealous of the new heir to the throne to rule the African plains. Scar tricks Simba to go to the elephant graveyard. Simba takes Nala despite Zazu's warnings. They are set upon by hyenas Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. Mufasa rescues them. Scar comes up with a scheme to kill Mufasa and Simba. Scar places Simba in the middle of a wildebeest stampede herded by the hyenas. Scar kills Mufasa while he's rescuing his son. The hyenas chase Simba away. Scar claims the throne with Simba assumed to be dead. Meerkat Timon and warthog Pumbaa befriends the lost Simba and teach him their motto "hakuna matata".Simba is an annoying brat. He's my main problem in this movie because he annoys me even as a self-obsessed cub. It is the point of the movie so I do have to overlook it somewhat. I just don't care enough about Simba. Although, I don't know how I would feel about an animated Hamlet. The songs are iconic. The drama is Shakespearian. There is a lot to like about this classic but not necessarily Simba.

                                                       The Lion King is unquestionably a first rate animated film - my daughter counts it as one of her favourite films of all time (and pinched my copy of the DVD when she left home!). But something about it doesn't quite work for me.The story is excellent, and I love the way that Simba's story is effortlessly tied in to the (non-preachy) circle of life broader picture.The voice talent is all excellent, character design and animation first class, the emotional high (and low) points are all reached as planned.Maybe it's the songs. I like Hans Zimmer's score, but I must confess to not liking all of Elton John's songs (particularly The Circle Of Life itself).And maybe it's just because I am becoming a grumpy old curmudgeon. Because, without any doubt, it is an absolute classic children's film.Edited 10 October 2011 after seeing 3D version at the cinema.Am I correct that this reworking is the first full-length 3D film using traditional drawn animation? Whether it is or not, it is a terrific conversion: it adds an element of visual majesty to a film which is already very good.

                                                       This is an absolutely amazing animated movie, one of the best ever created. Who can say they didn't cry when Mufasa died. That is one of the most beautifully tragic scenes in cinema history. It is so great when kids movies include something that really evokes emotion and heart. Another classic scene is the final battle between Simba and Scar. It is a great climax to everything that lead up to it.Then there's Simba's birth and presentation. It is beautiful on the edge of the cliff in front of all the other animals. The characters are all great in this film and the soundtrack is one that everyone knows and remembers. I don't think I could think of another movie that has so many well known, original songs featured in it. "The Lion King" is rated in my top three animated kids movies along with "The Brave Little Toaster" and The Land Before Time". It is truly a work of art.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  This was Disney's B-movie production. The studio was convinced that the following year's "Pocahontas" was going to rake in the cash and the praise. However, armed with a story lifted from "Hamlet" and some of the all-time great Disney songs, "The Lion King" became the last great film to come out of Disney's hand-drawn animations, and the last in a golden era which included "Aladdin" and "Beauty and the Beast". The young generation who grew up with this film have a level of affection for it that very few films have achieved. Their parents have a similar fondness for it. Now, some years on, that young generation can appreciate it as a family film once more with their children, but can also appreciate the superior level of craft which is in this film.From the breathtaking opening, the power of the songs is immediately apparent. "The Circle of Life" with the sun breaking across the plain is striking and iconic, for parent and child alike. The energy of "I just can't wait to be king" is contrasted with the scheming moodiness of "Be Prepared". "Hakuna Matata" is still adored and is delightfully witty (it has the most intelligent fart joke ever) and "Can you feel the love tonight?" is up there with "Beauty and the Beast" in the pantheon of great Disney love songs.The songs complement a story which is simple, effective and daring. Like many of the best Disney films, there is darkness here that the young viewer can deal with but gives the film added depth. The death of Mufasa can still bring the butchest teenager to tears. However, there is also a wealth of humour which ranges from intelligent and witty to absurd and hilarious ("What do you want me to do? Dress in drag and do the hula?"). Also, this is a proper story. The trials of Simba are thoroughly engaging and the world he finds himself in is richly populated by entertaining characters. The stand outs are the comic Timon and Pumbaa and Jeremy Irons's deliciously voiced villain, Scar ("I'm surrounded by idiots.").The film is also a fine example of technical class. It looks stunning – one of Disney's most beautifully drawn films – has a fine score by Hans Zimmer to accompany the award winning songs and was a major step forward in CG effects – the thrilling stampede sequence being almost entirely created in computers.This was a generation defining film, far superior and far more successful than "Pocahontas" (the VHS was the highest seller of all time). It was and is adored by millions. It has been somewhat forgotten, particularly after the advent of CG animation two years later with the magnificent "Toy Story". This film, however, deserves better as it is an undoubted classic to be enjoyed by young and old alike.

and the Beast, Aladdin, Toy Story 2, Robin Hood at a stretch, and that's about all you'll hear from me about the evil corporation..........but I just adore this film. It is the movie I have seen more than any other. I know it backwards.Animation, storyline, voice-talent, music, characters - this film has it all. There seem to be no cracks whatsoever in what has to be the perfect movie.I know it takes a lot from Hamlet, but so what? At least the film takes itself seriously, which is something that cannot really be said for some of the animated garbage coming out nowadays.If you've never seen this movie before, watch it, and you'll love it. I defy anyone to dislike this movie - it really is that good.Sad, so sad, it'll reduce you to tears, lest your heart be made of stone. Incredibly humorous in parts. Touching, without being overly sentimental. Even now, the animation stands out.And to think, when this was released, it was seen as the B movie to Pocahontas. Pocahontas was a pile of pathetic tripe, and deserved only one viewing. The Lion King, an accidental hit, will be forever remembered as a genuine Walt Disney Classic.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          One of the greatest films ever made, The Lion King is the very pinnacle of Disney's Renaissance Era that didn't just mark a creative high for the legendary animation studio but remains their most impressive work to date. An astounding masterpiece for all ages that's perfectly balanced in the smallest of aspects & still hasn't aged a day, this is without a doubt the greatest Disney film of all time.Set in the Pride Lands of Africa, The Lion King tells the story of a young lion prince who flees into exile after the death of his father when his uncle tricks him into believing that he is the one responsible for the king's demise. Growing up with two outcasts & embracing their carefree attitude, he is ultimately forced to confront his past after a chance encounter with an old friend & decides to return to his homeland.Directed by Roger Allers & Rob Minkoff, the film opens on such a grand note that its prologue alone is much better than most features turn out to be in their entire runtime. The whole story has an epic feel to it despite its grounded simplicity, the plot unfolds like a soothing breeze, the themes are handled with care, entertainment is top-notch and its carefully carved out characters add even more richness to the story.Each frame of its beautifully rendered animation is a work of spellbinding craftsmanship. Characters are brilliantly sketched too & do manage to express emotions amazingly well. Cinematography makes expert use of colour palettes & vibrant use of camera. Editing provides a frenetic pace to the whole narrative & is at its best during the musical numbers, while CGI is seamlessly integrated into its hand-drawn imagery.Although nearly every character in the picture has a well-defined arc, what makes them so much fun is the pitch-perfect voice cast that infuses new life into these characters & provide them their very own souls. James Earl Jones brings a king-like imposing quality to Mufasa, Matthew Broderick does well as Simba, Jeremy Irons is thrilling as Scar while both Nathan Lane & Ernie Sabella steal the show as Timon & Pumbaa with their impeccable timing & perfect chemistry.And last but not the least, I'd like to talk about its magnificent score. Composed by Hans Zimmer who was just starting out back then, the exquisitely arranged & masterfully orchestrated score elevates what was already an incredibly fascinating tale to such a grandeur level of epicness that even today, it remains the finest use of music in any animation feature out there. And further strengthening this aspect are catchy songs written by Tim Rice & Elton John.On an overall scale, The Lion King is an extraordinary blend of a highly gripping story, deftly written screenplay, state-of-the-art animation, cleverly drawn characters voiced by wisely chosen cast, terrific use of humour, skillful camera-work, tight editing as well as an outstanding score plus sensational songs, all of which work in seamless harmony in order to set an entirely new benchmark for its medium & effortlessly succeed.An emotionally stirring adventure that's full of heart, passion & creativity from start to finish, The Lion King is an unabashedly hilarious, occasionally melancholic, extremely intimate, thoroughly enjoyable, delightfully engaging, intensely thrilling, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying fable about life, death, identity, responsibility & resurrection that borrows from William Shakespeare's Hamlet yet is able to carve out its very own identity before it is finished.Marking the last great high for Disney's Renaissance Era that came crashing down soon after the advent of Pixar Animation Studios, The Lion King is a work of cinematic perfection that still stands tall & remains unblemished by the test of time and, for the epic this timeless classic is in every sense of the word, will continue to do so comfortably for a very foreseeable future. Absolutely worth your time & money, the crown jewel of Walt Disney Animation comes one hundred percent recommended.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I first saw The Lion King in 1994, when I was 8 years old. Ever since then, I have seen it at least 100 times. I have seen it at least that much because I watched it once every week for almost a year and a half.Recently, I became interested in it again, after having seen The Lion King 3 (or 1,5 if you prefer). It kind of surprised me how I was still intrigued and impressed by the whole thing. It was a magical experience that was almost as good as the very first time (I hadn't seen it in years).Everything about The Lion King is so good, that I can watch it over and over again, just like in the old days. The story begins light-hearted and it has a very nice and fun atmosphere. Very stereotypical characters, as always with Disney, but ever so unique in their own way. As the story progresses, it gets very serious, dramatic and sad as well, I actually cried when I saw it the first time (hey, I was 8, give me a break).Then two of the greatest characters in the history of Disney cartoons get introduced. Timon & Pumbaa set a new height considering comedy in cartoons. Again, very stereotypical, but unique in their own way (I loved Lion King 3 because of them).Another thing I absolutely love about this is the awesome music in it. When I was young I didn't pay attention to it as much as I do now, but the music adds so much to the whole movie.It was very obvious, even from just the intro alone, that Disney worked very hard on this masterpiece. I will definitely never forget The Lion King. I still watch it occasionally and I've never been bored.That's another thing I like about this: the songs. Every major Disney picture has a few songs in it and most of the time they are very memorable. It's the same story here, the songs are very memorable and overall just brilliant. "Circle of Life" and "Can't Wait to be King" will always have a special place in my heart.I knew the entire script of the Dutch dubbed version when I was young, having seen it so many times. Kind of pathetic, I know, but I liked it that much. Still do.The King among Disney Cartoons for me.

movie, its one of my favourite movies in its own right. The animation was amazing, and captured the essences of the Savannah brilliantly. The story and plot was one which people of all ages, not just children, could follow and understand, an impressive achievement for an animated movie, one scene in particular wouldn't leave a dry eye in the house, no matter what age the viewer may be, such was its emotional power. The voice acting was some of the best I've seen, particularly James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson and Jeremy Irons, and of course Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, who at times were flat out hilarious as Timon and Pumba. The music and songs didn't disrupt the scenes they were in, if anything they added to it, particularly the opening song The Circle Of Life which was the best opening to an animated movie I've seen so far. Some have criticized the portrayal of certain animals like the hyena's and the movie doesn't depict life on the plains accurately, well the correct response to that is, its only a story and it isn't meant to as its not a nature documentary. This is a timeless classic which will never age, the fact that it took twenty years for another animated movie to overtake it as the highest-grossing animated movie is a testament to just how brilliant this movie is. A classic which all the family will enjoy.

"The Lion King" is the Disney Renaissance period at its pinnacle and probably the last hand-drawn Disney classic.Now, I won't mention Pixar and the 3D animated features again, because I want, for once, to take a big plunge and get back to that magical year that was 1994. Disney Renaissance was this unexpected animated streak that started with "The Little Mermaid" and brought up memorable masterpieces such as "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin", which finally elevated the world of Animation to the same level of spectacular greatness and respectability than live-action films. But I think there are two words that get often mixed up : masterpieces and classics, a movie can be an excellent technical accomplishment but for some reasons, it gets less recognition than a minor film. I like "Mermaid", the two B's and I'm a big fan of "Aladdin", they might be classic in terms or notoriety, but there are more of animated masterpieces, while it can be said about "The Lion King" that it's not only a masterpiece, but also a timeless classic."The Lion King" is not an exhilarating adventure, nor a passionate romance, not a comic film, it's a wonderful coming-of-age story, focusing on the most universal values that guide our lives. On that level, the film is to Disney Renaissance what "Bambi" was to the Golden Age. And the comparison here is not fortuitous, "The Lion King" works almost as an adult drama whose most important theme is succession and passing of time, with the interesting notion that Simba, the central character, must conquer a lost title back. From the opening, we get the full meaning of the eternal cycle of time, with a rising sun announcing the birth of the new Prince, and all the animals of the savanna coming to pay respect to the King Mufasa's newborn son. The opening sequence of "The Lion King" with Elton John's "Circle of Life" is probably one of Disney greatest movie moments ever, and the proof, it it ever was needed, of that Disney capability to touch hearts and command our feelings with the simple magic use of motion and colors.This sequence and every following frame highlight the perfect mastery of every technical element : the animation, the dazzling cinematography with the perfect use of reliefs and colors to illustrate the diversity of a rich animal microcosm, the direction, the music, I mean both the score and the songs, the characters and probably more than anything, the story. It's about succession, family, life and death, jealousy and betrayal with the villain whose no one but the King's brother, Scar, whose suave voice from Jeremy Irons, provides a touch I would qualify as 'Shakespearian', a more sophisticated word for 'universal'. But forget these big words, because to understand why "The Lion King" is such an endearing classic, we have to regard it through the eyes of those who discovered the film as kids. In "The Lion King", there's no romance, it's not about getting the girl, or the boy, the main character is a kid who wants to become like his father, who learns about the meaning of life, of courage and more than anything, of his identity, something sacred based on two pivotal elements : heritage and family, the past and the future, the very position in the circle of life. We can all relate to Simba as kids and as adults. And generally, the Disney stories that are centered on a kid are more appealing : "Dumbo" was about difference's acceptance, "Pinocchio" about responsibilities, "The Fox and the Hound" about tolerance, "Jungle Book" about \u0085 not that one was just pure fun \u0085 Romances rely on so many elements of predictability it easily undermines their appeal, and to recognize Disney romances, they're generally the ones where you most remember the scene-stealing sidekicks or comic relief characters.In "The Lion King", Simba is the heart of the story, and we follow him during an epic journey in life, with his father and mentor, Mufasa, the King with that naturally authoritarian James Earl Jones' voice. Just thinking of the scene where they play at night gives me shudders, and I mean it : any boy close to his father can understand that level of tenderness and love \u0085 and of course, it makes the following sequence even more horrific, but this is what makes the film so memorable. Generations of kids have been traumatized by Bambi mom's death, why sparing ours? As usual, in Disney films, death, if not part of life, is part of a learning process, tragic but necessary. This is "The Lion King", a wonderful story, populated by a gallery of (literally) colorful characters following an extraordinary soundtrack with so many unforgettable catchy songs, that lurched the film into pop culture memories : "Hakuna Matata !" If there was ever a music associated with 1994, it would belong to "The Lion King", and I'm glad it won an Oscar for this, as I'm glad Hans Zimmer won for the score too, as it probably is the musical expression of the film's emotional power. The conclusion of the film where Simba gets back on the top of the rock and starts roaring give me thrills (just thinking of it) and never fails to make me cry.There are no words to describe what makes "The Lion King" so great. It's like the Disney team decided to combine all the efforts for a last masterpiece ... that would become one of the greatest animated films ever. So great I would have loved that the ghost of Walt Disney would haunt them every once in a while, saying : "Remember who you are"

The main one is that it brings me back to my childhood, and at that time I enjoyed the movie so much. I even had the VHS in English and Spanish version. Then the film came out on DVD and I also bought it. When it first came out on IMAX for any reason I couldn't go to see it again so now for the 3D release I definitely was not going to miss that opportunity. And all I can say is that this film will be forever inmortal. At the theater that I went there were people in the mid 20s like myself singing the songs, repeating the lines, it is just something that you don't see everyday. About the movie, everything has been said before: it is just so perfect, so balanced, it is a treat for the eyes for its amazing animation, it makes you laugh histerically with lovable characters like timon and pumba, it has a lot of emotional moments (spoilers) yes mufasas death is very sad but what really gets to me is when mufasa gets into the stampede to protect simba that is just heart breaking for me its not the death itself but the events that occur before his dead. Also at the very end when Simba takes his place as king is just magical, powerful it gives me chills when the bones are washed away by the rain while simba listens the voice of his father "remember" definitely this is pure gold a movie for old and young and a gem that will absolutely will pass the test of time.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              What can I say about this movie that already hasn't been said? But I'll try. Simply, I believe The Lion King is the greatest animated movie ever made. It has some tough competition believe me. There's Wall-e, Toy Story, Spirited Away, Fantasia etc. But as an overall film, The Lion King stand above the pride.\nThe animation, is just beautiful. It holds up so well over 25 years later. Even in an age where 3D animation is getting better and better, the classic hand drawn look of the film never ceases to amaze me. The movements of the characters and the lush backgrounds are beyond superb and the entire animation team should be commended.\nThe characters are so memorable and lovable. Simba, our reluctant hero, must overcome his past and insecurities to save his people. Matthew Broderick is great as Simba as well. Scar is one of cinemas best villains. A great example of how a villain can be so in the wrong but also understandable and even sympathetic. His motives make sense, but his methods are detestable. Jeramy Irons captures all of that wonderfully in his performance. Mufasa, played by the amazing James Earl Jones, shows us how a monarch should behave. He's respectable and never takes more than he needs. He teaches his son to respect the world and the creatures who inhabit it. The rest of the cast of characters keeps us entertained throughout. Timon and Pumba are brilliant comic relief and Rafiki reminds me a lot of Yoda. He's a wise old master who helps our hero discover his calling.\nThe music is so great. Several songs are performed by The amazing Elton John. Tim Rice wrote the lyrics. While the songs are rightfully praised, the musical score by Hans Zimmer is one of the best in movie history, bar none. This is Lawrence of Arabia and Star Wars levels of epic music. It has so many iconic themes and it rightfully won the Oscar for best score.\nIt has a deceitfully simple plot, but once you unfold it more, you see the extra layers to it. The story has been interpreted in numerous ways, but I've always seen it as an allegory against unchecked and abused power. Scar is a dictator, through and through. Mufasa was a benevolent king who only took what he needed and, despite the predator-pray relationship, respected the world around him. Scar on the other hand, cares nothing for the people but only his own gain and glory. Simba realizes that he must stop Scar to save his people and return peace to the land. He has great power, so he must have great responsibility. He can't rule over the people with an iron paw but with a gentle and compassionate one. It's a story that resonates with me. I always find something different about it every time I watch it. Of course, you can interpret it any many other ways I'm sure, this is just my take.\nAll in all, The Lion King is a masterpiece of animated cinema. It is the Disney company's greatest achievement and is rightfully celebrated as not just one of the best animated movies ever, but as one of the best movies ever made, period.

It relates the story of the young lion Simba, who is destined to become king of the pride one day when his regal father Mufasa steps down. This does not sit well with Mufasa's villainous brother Scar, who concocts a scheme to eliminate Mufasa and then convince a guilt-stricken Simba that the death is his own fault and he should exile himself from the pride. Simba befriends the unlikely duo of a meercat and warthog and they become friends during his exile, until his childhood friend Nala arrives to apprise Simba of the ruin that Scar's villainy has left the pride and beg for Simba's return.Although the plot is fairly familiar and clichéd for a new story, there is a lot that could be done here. Unfortunately, Simba is such a passive, uninteresting central character that it is difficult to care much about what happens. Other than Simba, Mufasa and Scar, the pride pretty much blurs together. Simba's mother is a virtual non-entity and Simba's female friend Nala is gone for so much of the running time that you nearly forget she is a character in the film. Other than the comical meercat and warthog team (well voiced by Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella), none of the supporting characters are especially memorable, and that duo has little to no impact on the climax. It also does not help that Scar (lazily voiced by Jeremy Irons) is a fairly dull villain. His first act number where he sings about his nefarious plans is disturbing, not only because of Irons horrendous singing, but because someone had the ill-conceived notion of having hordes of his hyena henchmen goose-stepping in the background like Nazi soldiers, which adds a heavy weight that this slight film cannot carry. The film also has a fair amount of dead spots between songs and fight scenes.The animation is typically first-rate, but not as impressive or imaginative as that found in its predecessors, even as recent as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. The vocal talent is a mixed bag as well. While Lane and Sabella are stand-outs and James Earl Jones provides the suitably dignified tones for Mufasa, Matthew Broderick is an incredibly bland choice to voice the adult Simba. Ditto, Moira Kelly is not much better as Nala. Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin are not particularly menacing as some of the hyenas.Huge gaps in the story seem to smack of really lazy writing. Mufasa is supposed to be an insightful leader, yet is completely blind-sided by the evil plots of his nasty brother, whose perfidy is ridiculously blatant. Once Scar is king and demonstrates that he is terrible, the film would have us believe that not only are there no other male lions to challenge him, but that the lionesses would passively put up with him destroying the pride without any show of resistance. This, of course, sets up the scene for Simba to return as a savior and rescue the pride while facing down Scar, but there are several things wrong. First, the film never convinces us that there is a need for anyone to await Simba's return when the pride could have banded together themselves to challenge Scar and his minions instead of suffering. And second, Simba does nothing during the course of the film to demonstrate that he could be anyone's savior other than that he is Mufasa's son and the plot rather ham-handedly demands it of him.I am also not a fan of the soundtrack written by Elton John. The film opens with the "The Circle of Life," which is a sequence that heralds the birth of Simba, introduces the main characters and sets the stage. Unfortunately, I find this song comes off like one of the worst examples of faux-inspirational Christian rock. "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" sung by the young Simba feels like a third-rate Michael Jackson riff. "Hakuna Matata" is probably the best of the songs, but it is surprisingly forgettable. And the less said about the dirge-like love ballad "Can You Feel the Love Tonight", the better. It is a horrible song badly shoe-horned into the film. Old childhood friends Simba and Nala rediscover each other and then immediately start fighting, then the film pauses for the love ballad, before they go back to fighting and parting. It is a clumsily staged sequence and one that more often than not has the little ones tuning out. Ironically, the song that sticks with the viewer after the film ends is "The Lion Sleeps Tonight", the old 1950s nutshell which gets a few bars sung in the film and easily outclasses John's pretentious and precious piffles.Purportedly this is Walt Disney's biggest box office success, but it is hard to understand why or how given some of the landmark classics in animation that Disney has provided in the past. I don't find the film fun, or memorable, or particularly astonishing. In fact, barring the dreadful Hercules, I would rank this as one of the worst of the Disney films.

                                 While the lion king isn't quite up there with some other movies, like the Incredibles and cars, the lion king is still great and so emotional. Mostly the scene of mufasa's death scene. Every single character is impactful. Simba is an amazing protagonist with a PERFECT arc, scar is PURE GENIUS as a antagonist. Timon and pumbaa are the single best comedic relief duo in Disney history, I'll talk about it more in reviews of movies that will require me to talk about them more. And every other character on the movie, the story and plot are like no other in any movie before or after this masterpiece. I could go on more, but I shouldn't because you know it's great, you all love it, it's the lion king.

seeing Pinocchio at a pretty early age and "Robin Hood" on its initial release made huge impacts on me, and by the time this film came out I'd caught up with all of the Disney features. I loved - and still love - the early work, and have mixed reactions to most of the stuff from "Peter Pan" through "Oliver and Company" with a few exceptions. "The Little Mermaid" seemed like a return to form - and a return to the fairy tales that the company always seemed to do best with, and I liked "Beauty and the Beast" even more. "Aladdin" was alas a major step down - still pretty solid in the animation department, but Robin Williams' shtick was for me completely out of place and irritating. It was of course their biggest hit to that point, and they took some of the lessons they'd learned - less romance, more slapstick and gross humor, celebrity voices - and applied them to "The Lion King" with even more spectacular results.For 15 years this film has ranked among my worst films of all time, and every time I mention that I get people reacting as if I told them I was the Antichrist. Seriously - I think more people will get bent out of shape if you tell them you hate "The Lion King" than if your feelings are negative about "Citizen Kane", "Casablanca", or "2001". It's always struck me as weird, because I know I'm not the only person to dislike it, and in fact none of the friends I saw it with when it came out liked it much - though none of them hated it like I did either.I think that the main problem for me in 1994 is that the elements that I disliked from "Aladdin" in particular seemed amped-up several degrees here. I hated Whoopi and Cheech, hated the music, hated above all what I saw at the time was an infantilist assault on intelligence and wit - the smartest and coolest character in the film, Scar, also is pure evil, and all of the "good" characters are white-bread, boring, stupid. Dumb and strong triumphs over smart and clever; the songs sucked; the animation was coarser and less interesting than in the previous couple of films. I suspect that there were a lot of personal issues that contributed to my overwhelming hatred of the film, too, but those are lost to me at the moment.I'm pleased to say on this re-watch that I don't HATE the film anymore. But I still don't like it. The issues with the treatment of Scar - not sure what I was thinking there, that was over-the-top on my part. Sure Jeremy Irons' voicing of him is in many ways a typical smart but venal character, a Godless intellectual I suppose - but it's not really that overstated or deliberate, it doesn't come off as anti-intellectual to me anymore. James Earl Jones' Mufasa may not be a genius, but he doesn't come off as a dumb noble-hearted brute either, and nobody can really beat Jones in that kind of role. The opening sequences are somewhat impressive, and the film is rarely boring. I actually sort of liked the shaman baboon character Rafiki (Robert Guillaume), and it's good that young Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas/Matthew Broderick) takes a fair amount of screen time to grow up.But...I still hate the music; "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" I actually found tolerable in relation to the other songs, but even it was so cloying and just banal that I had a hard time not fast-forwarding. This is purely a matter of taste, I make no bones about it - I like very little of Elton John's post-1970s work and so it's not surprising really. I still find the hyena characters irritating, unfunny, and way over-used. The female characters are essentially just there to move the action forward - no, the film ain't obviously racist like I guess I thought it was (though it's rather confusing in its racial and ethnic undertones) but it's definitely a boys' film. Timon and Pumbaa are gross and annoying and the film as a whole just has no sparkle, no wit to me. The animation doesn't have the zip or the beauty of the previous few films; the direction and pacing seem more inevitable than exciting, the "spectacular" scenes like the stampede that kills Mufasa just don't come off as all that spectacular as the digital help is too obvious and cheap-looking.In any case, it wasn't torture to watch anymore, and it's actually reawakened an interest in going back through the Disney feature canon, re-watching some of the ones I don't remember well and catching up with a few of the newer ones that I never bothered with after being disappointed by this and "Pocahontas" in succession.

The combination of different colors and shapes portraying this Shakespearean story result in a cinematic experience you will not want to miss. All of the characters leave an impact on the audience through the beautiful character development and relationships. This makes the meat of the film engaging and heart-breaking.\nMufasa's death scene is sad, because we sympathize with Simba and his father's relationship that was previously established. Some consider it to be the saddest scene in cinema history, and I can't argue against that. When Nala finds Simba after many years of sorrow in the Pride Land, their love which was foreshadowed at the beginning feels deserved and romantic. Even as a kid I always found that scene compelling.\nThe main thing that makes this story and the characters work is the animation. Nobody would have cried over Mufasa's death if we couldn't see Simba's emotion portrayed in the animation. Every character is personified, because in animation you are able to do this. This is why I am not excited at all for the Live Action remake. You can't take away emotion from the movie and expect the audience to relate. Disney remaking their animated films in live action in general is not a good artistic idea. It is always a downgrade from the original, because you cannot portray emotion on inanimate objects or animals in the real world. That is why the animated versions are always better.\nBut in the end, even though the live action version will most likely be terrible, at least we still have the beauty of the original.

The Lion King is an absolute delight to watch. I feel like it's the best movie ever made by Disney, and one of the best movies ever made in general. It beautifully portrays Hamlet in a funny and charming way and is told with some of the most beautiful hand-drawn animation ever produced. It explores the themes of self-identity, grief and honour in a beautiful and emotionally-destructive way. The characters all do what they're supposed to do without being too annoying or bland. Scar is an intimidating and terrifying villain who really packs a punch. The songs are all outstanding, my personal favorites being "Hakuna Matata" and "Be Prepared". It has some the most gorgeous score I've ever heard in a movie which makes the emotional scenes even more sad to watch, to the point where I'm just bawling my eyes out in a little ball on the floor. It's an important movie that everyone in their lifetime should watch, and I really mean it.

                                                                                                                                                                 The opening scene of The Lion King will show where you stand with this film in terms of what generation you were born in. People born outside of this generation (say, anytime before 1980) will find it pleasing and enjoyable. Those from this current generation (1981 and beyond, myself included) will be simply in awe and, if one were to recall this from their childhood (who from this time period hasn't seen this?) they may even shed a few tears.I did and I'm not afraid to admit it. The Lion King is a dashingly fierce achievement from Disney, one with gripping scenes of delight and uncompromising beauty and charm. Its songs seem more than just standard Disney archetypes, but those of true power and importance, especially "Hakuna Matata" and "Circle of Life," the opening ballad.The story concerns Simba, a feisty cub whose parents, Mufasa and Sarabi, carry a very respected reputation throughout the land. Mufasa is "the king of the jungle" and Simba "can't wait to be king," and for that reason, is always getting into some sort of trouble. Mufasa's brother, Scar, is jealous and holds an incredible disdain for his brother and Simba. When Simba gets himself into big trouble, causing a wild stampede of hyenas (which, by the way, is just breathtakingly slick and stylish), Mufasa is killed by Scar, when trying to rescue Simba. Scar makes Simba feel as if he was responsible for the death of his father and implores him to run away.So he does, and Scar takes the throne in no time, running the Pride Lands into the ground and completely ruining the consistency and order Mufasa took so long to build.Upon running away, Simba meets up with Timon, a meerkat, and Pumba, a warthog in "the jungle, the mighty jungle." They teach the naive little cub how to thrive in the jungle, and fast-forward a few years, and Simba is older, stronger, even feistier than before, and with a full grown mane.The Lion King collectively merges the classic Shakespearean story of Hamlet with the divine simplicity and the "walk on the other side of the road" formula of their 1967 hit Jungle Book into a true achievement in every category. There's a beautiful thing about the way the film conceives emotions and builds on locations. From the first frame to the last, it is littered with evocative landscapes, some of which are hard to believe they're only hand-drawn, pre-CGI work. The use of lighting and darkness can be vaguely called "animation noir" before it became a real standard, with the sunlit landscapes of the Pride Lands and the excellent use of darkness when it came to showcasing the Scar character, is truly masterful and beyond words.It is also interesting to note that The Lion King sort of kicks off Disney's "dare to be different" phase that it maintained well into the 2000's with films like Atlantis: The Lost Empire and Lilo and Stitch truly pushing what the company can really do. The Lion King's story, mainly centered around guilt, power, and redemption, is a lot darker with only occasional touches of humor breaking through the melancholic presence of the story. The youngsters may have a hard time coping. I know if I saw this any younger than six it would've been uncomfortable. Though it seems that with the abundance of re-releases the film is getting, the story appeals to those of all ages.NOTE: It's a shame that Disney has stooped to the level of manipulation and tampering with this grandiose animated achievement. To see it get a 3D re-release and multiple re-releases on DVD just to become lucrative for the company, also equipped with a surcharge, is somewhat heartbreaking.Voiced by: Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Moira Kelly, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, and Rowan Atkinson.

               To call this a "simple kids film" is to not understand this film at all. Along the lines of Bambi, there's a lot of dark subject matter to be explored (the death of a parent) and even deeper is the use of texts like The Odyssey and Hamlet as seemingly interesting inspirations incorporated into a Disney film with heart, charm, and glorious music.The acting is all well done. Everyone gives it their A-game, especially James Earl Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, and Jeremy Irons. Broderick is okay, though cannot deliver his lines without a huge effort on his behalf.The animation is stunning. Such vivid imagery and color is used in the opening shots that it sets the standard for the rest of the picture.Hans Zimmer's score is the second-greatest I've ever heard (next to The Lord of the Rings films, which I count as one film). The sweeping "king of the past" theme is gorgeous, and the haunting cues for Scar are terrifying. The musical numbers written by Tim Rice are great, and are sure to be remembered for ages. Elton John's, Can You Feel the Love Tonight? is so grand and beautiful, it was completely deserving of the Best Original Song Academy Award.The story is confined to 90-minutes, though I could've watched twice of that. The film's pace is never dulling, and always inspiring. From the sheer horror Simba faces when seeing his dead father, to the simply masterpiece of a scene where the rains wash away Scar's destroying of Pride Rock, and Simba's ascension as king... just beautiful.Overall, right alongside Finding Nemo, The Lion King is the best film Disney has ever produced. From its story to it's execution, it is flawlessly excellent. I highly recommend you see this film if you haven't already.

                                    This movie truly is a classic and one of the best films I have ever seen, even after 21 years since its release. Timon and Pumbaa are hilarious and so is Rafiki the baboon.The story of growing up between Simba and Mufasa is especially touching and can teach a lot to us today. And of course, the jealousy and betrayal of Scar are themes that echo real life.And, of course, the fact that Simba and Nala have their own cub at the end is great. This movie has a great voice cast, awesome animation, a great storyline, and as with all of the early to mid 90s Disney films, an absolutely perfect soundtrack.Truly deserving of its tag as Disney's best film until Frozen, it will always be a classic to me.

                        The Lion King is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a great voice cast. It's an absolute classic that still holds up today as a beautifully animated and exhilarating film, I become warped in to this universe every time I watch it and almost immediately because of its beautiful opening image, we really care for these characters and support them on the journey they are headed on, it can be quite dark at times, very emotional, but it never forgets to add some great comic relief. I felt like the film could have taken more time to develop Scar's character, it needed to make its audience more aware of his motives, not just his plans on achieving them, I would have liked to have seen longer scenes between him and the hyenas, as this is when the villain is truly honest about who he really is, and he is certainly one of the greatest Disney villains there is. The characters and voice acting in this film are certainly the best part and save it from being a boring animation with talking animals, Simba, Timon, Pumba, Mufasa, Nala, Rafiki, Zazu and Scar are all characters that I remember fondly from my childhood, as I watched this film again and again, and still today love them just as much as ever, as I understand some of their lines, particularly from Timon, that I never did when I was younger. Beautifully animated, jam packed with great songs, memorable characters and emotional scenes, the Lion King is easily some of Disney's greatest work, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. A young lion cub runs away from home after believing he accidentally killed his father, although it was actually his uncle, who intends on becoming the King of Pride Rock.

                                                   This is in my top 3 animation films of all time. I don't think that any animation film before it managed to enter the hearts of both children and adults at once like this one. An ensemble cast with such a gripping tale, great music and superb animation, made this one of the all time greats. The characters are so well flushed out and each scene is so memorable. I cannot stress just how good this film is. Without a doubt the peak of Disney and to this day they have not made anything this original and so influential. The creators gave us such a good villain and great hero's that in my opinion shows that an animated film can be just as good or if not better than a real life film.

animated Disney film featuring voice of Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, and James Earl Jones. The film revolves around a future king who is tricked by his evil uncle to never return. This film is also inspired by the Shakespeare play Hamlet which both films have the same plot line, except The Lion King is more appropriate for children than Hamlet. And that's what makes this movie so perfect in every way is that the screenwriters decided to take a classic Shakespeare play and make their own version made for kids, while at the same time not following Hamlet down to detail. Before the new Lion King comes out I thought I watched the original where it all began. The animation that went into this film is beautiful as everyone involved really took the time to develop a film that has passion and soul to it. And the voice acting is top notch too from James Earl Jones as Mufasa to Jeremy Irons as Scar. In all of Disney movies there will never be a better voice actor as Jeremy Irons. Ever delivery is chilling and sends goosebumps thinking about it that if there was ever someone to narrate my life he would make that list. I don't know how the new Lion King will turn out, but I know that this Lion King trumps the new one, and all Disney films. And while this may be he king of all animated films, the soundtrack provided was average with one or two songs that are excellent to listen too. So before you watch the new one take a moment to go back where it all began and experience a movie so hypnotic and beautiful from start to finish.

The movie has it all: an excellent plot, perfect character description, amazing musical numbers, and excellent animations.The similarities between "The Lion King" and "Hamlet" are obvious but I must say that very different at the same time. "Hamlet" is a tale of ambition, lust, power, betrayal while "The Lion King" treats the same situations but such in a magical way that you can't help but adore.When I first watched this movie in theaters, I felt powerful. The events are dedicated 100% for children but adults can enjoy them too. To this day, I watch when possible this movie and it always makes me feel very good. This is in my opinion the best Disney movie you can find. Please, watch it because you will have a great, great time.

As really this movie is about Simba who is thrown away like garbage over in his cruel uncle Scar after his beloved father and king of the Pride Land is killed over wanting to be king.When Simba meets comic reliefs Pumba and Timon the breakout characters and live a responsibility free life as the animals at Pride Land suffer and due to Scar's cruelty now united with the dangerous hyeneasAs it will take a lot of convincing to get Simba back and fight against Scar and take his rightful place hence the titular character. Such a classic movie.

cinema. I was a kid and I remember crying while watching - I was in love with the characters and I was feeling them. They felt so real to me. Now... actually, as a grown person, now is the same. Characters are so believable and so realistic. Watching the movie as an adult brings a whole new meaning. The good and the bad characters from the movie are like the people I meet everyday in real life. The story is full of morals which I think are really important for young kids these days. I think that The Lion King is a must for every child and adult! With it's characters and plot, it can really move you and the kids might actually learn something from it. It is far better than modern cartoons full of meaningless action and dialogue.

piece together the whole story that way, this was the first time I had watched the entire thing in one showing on a big screen and in 3-D, to boot! In short, it was a wonderfully magical time just seeing such a classically made drawn animated movie by the best artists Disney had to offer with great music and songs by Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and Tim Rice and perfect voices provided by James Earl Jones, Madge Sinclair, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillaume, Jeremy Irons as the villainous Scar, and especially, Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as the great comic relief of Timon and Pumbaa! If there was one slight flaw, it's that how stupid was Scar to reveal his role in killing his brother just as nephew Simba was at death's door. But it did provide Simba to get over himself quickly so maybe that was necessary. Otherwise, The Lion King is one of the greatest experiences I've had at the movies. P.S. If you don't stay for the closing credits and had wondered where the dedication to the late Disney head Frank Wells, previously printed before the film, had gone to-it's now at the very end.

                                                  I remember seeing it when I was a kid and I loved it. Then I saw it again as an adult, and I absolutely loved it: This have to be one of the best animated movies ever made. The drawings are beautiful and full with details, the songs are catchy, the characters were very likable, and the story is memorable, filled with funny and powerful moments."The Lion King" was one of the best movies released by Disney and it was easily one of the best movies ever made. It wasn't until the last year, when Disney released "The Princess and the Frog" that any animated film from Disney reached this level of quality. "The Lion King" it's a timeless animation made for people of all ages.A real shame Disney probably will never make any other film like this again. That company has lost all his magic (and the talent) it once had, focusing non-stop in making these dull live-action versions of their classics nobody asked.If only someone dared to make a great movie like this in the current era...We have the technology, but alas, big studios only care to make a maximum profit appealing to the lowest common denominator with zero regards to the art of animation.Time will pass, trends will die, but true art will remain. And this truly deserves its title as one of the best animated films ever made.

                        First off, I have to admit that this review will most likely be peppered with sentiment and generational bias, as this was the very first film I was ever exposed to. I was a total child of the '90s (indeed, sometimes I still say "NOT!" at the end of a sentence\u0085 not (pun intended, sorry)), and one of the fondest memories I have from that period in my life was when my dad took my brother and sister and I to see The Lion King on the big screen in 1994, when I was only six years old. Although my memories of that experience are obviously now only very feint (about the only parts of the film I can recall from that screening are the Hakuna Matata scene and the stampede), The Lion King is a movie that has practically become part of my life.Influenced heavily by Shakespeare's Hamlet, The Lion King follows the adventures of Simba (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas as a lion cub and Matthew Broderick as an adult lion), a curious and mischievous lion cub who "just can't wait to be king." Framed for the murder of his father Mufasa (the commanding voice of James Earl Jones) and exiled from the Pride Lands by his jealous and power-mad uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons, voicing the kids' movie villain that has plagued the nightmares of more children than any other since the Wicked Witch of the West), Simba escapes to a rainforest paradise inhabited by Timon the meerkat (Nathan Lane, pricelessly hilarious) and Pumbaa the warthog (Ernie Sabella). However, destiny calls thanks in part to a reunion with childhood best friend Nala (voiced by Niketa Calame as a cub and Moira Kelly as a lioness), and Simba gallantly returns to the Pride Lands to at last confront his sins and take his rightful place as King of the Pride Lands.The Lion King is, without serious rivals, my absolute favourite animated film of all. And the reasons why? Firstly, the afore-mentioned nostalgic significance. But it goes much deeper than that. When I was a boy, I was completely oblivious to all the actual themes in the film, such as courage, loyalty, redemption and facing one's sins (although over the years it did teach me to learn from my mistakes). Now, as a far more experienced and worldly 20-year-old, I can watch The Lion King back and \u0096 with now recognizing and understanding those themes, and seeing how ambiguously and intricately they're woven into the plot, so they're not shoved down the viewer's throat \u0096 I now know and appreciate what a rare film The Lion King really is.On top of that, the traditional animation holds up very well against the now-dominant form that is computer animation, the screenplay by Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton is resplendent with by turns exuberance, humour, emotion and timeless and universal themes of the heart, and the soundtrack \u0096 powered by those amazing Elton John/Tim Rice standards "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" and "Circle of Life" and Hans Zimmer's mouth-watering score \u0096 is second to none. Don't get me wrong, most other works in the Disney cannon are great, but this one will forever the jewel in the crown in my eyes. And I still have the VHS tape. And cry when Mufasa dies. And know all the words to every song.Thanks for the memories, Rob, Roger and co. The Lion King is one that movie that I'll certainly be introducing my kids to someday.

"The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast," "Aladdin" and "The Lion King" in quick succession had set a new standard for animation. Unfortunately for Disney, "The Lion King" would be its last hurrah for a while, or really for good. Pixar would soon pick up the torch, and now Pixar is king of the jungle.But as for "The Lion King"......."Beauty and the Beast" is probably my favorite Disney animated film, but this one is a close second. It's the darkest and most ambitious and it's got superb animation. The song score by Elton John is the weakest in the above-mentioned string of films, but the orchestral score by Hans Zimmer is the best. The film doesn't shy away from the savagery of the natural world, or the difficult emotions surrounding life and death, and for that I applaud it.Grade: A

           'The Lion King' is a Disney animation about a lion cub named Simba who runs away from his responsibility after thinking that he is to blame for his father's fate. Along the way, Simba meets Timon and Pumba, the comical sidekicks. It's a sad film, but it is a film about life, and it is realistic in that sense. However, 'The Lion King' is probably my least favourite Disney animation. Although Timon and Pumba are supposed to provide the comic relief, I found the couple very annoying. Yes, this film had huge success in the 1990s, but I was never impressed with it. Most people seem to really enjoy this film, so I am probably in the majority for giving it a low rating, but I just did not think it was that good of a film.

                                                                             This may be an unorthodox way to start a review, but hey it's as meaningful as i'll ever be for a review. My lucky number is 14. I was born on August 14th. My birth sign is Leo (Lion), my State Football Team is the Lions, and its been 14 years since i'v seen my favorite movie from my childhood; The Lion King for the first time. And now I had the honor to experience it in the theater. From the moment the black screen faded to the rising sun along on the African Plane, with opening Zulu lyrics playing to Circle of Life, I got chills up my spine and my lips were shaking as they were forming the biggest smile I think i'v ever had. Now of all the films to come out these past years like the final Harry Potter, Avatar, Inception, Super 8, Transformers, etc. I want make this clear; The Lion King was the funnest time i'v ever had at the Movies! I don't even care for it being part of the 3D effect.I wanted to see it in the theater as if it was the opening weekend back in 1994. It's still The Lion King, but in a sentimental way (If your a 90's kid) it makes you completely feel dropped back into your seat like it's was the first time viewing it. The story of a young lion prince, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Matthew Broderick) framed into killing his father Mufasa (James Earl Jones) by his evil uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons). Then flees from his past and meets Timon (Nathan Lane) and Pumba (Ernie Sabella) whom teach him "Hakuna Matata" (Literally meaning No Worries). And in the end Simba returns to be the one true king. The story may be considered Hamlet with lions, but it's so much more than that. Most in part of the fun characters, humor, and still having the true drama and emotion that makes The Lion King what it is. The 3D added depth to the film and actually didn't give me a headache. Zazu flying overhead Pride Rock, the music sequences, and the stampede scene are better than ever, yet I'm sure the new generation seeing it will probably be emotionally scarred for life. I don't want to be a "Lion King is the Best Disney Movie Ever" Guy without mentioning it has a flaw. Which is its quick resolve with the last 40 minutes of the movie. Yeah, Simba is intervened by his old childhood friend Nala and crazy shaman blue butt monkey Rafiki to go back home from his 'time away from home' that almost feels like the 10 second log scene in Hakuna Matata. In any way it still doesn't turn you away. Then add the key ingredient to a classic Disney Movie; Songs! Just another element that adds to the formula. Elton John and Tim Rice won an Oscar for their work on this film! And who's to say they don't deserve it? Circle of Life, Just Can't Wait to be King, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, Can You Feel the Love Tonight, and even Timons Hula Song! It took every bone in my body not to sing in the theater but hey, now there's another reason for multiple viewings. I want to say to those who are curious, there is no "Morning Report" song in the film! Disneys Classic 2D Animated films are true Disney.Disney mixed meaningful and powerful themes with maximum entertainment in a perfect way that are what make true classics. Today any critic from the New York Times can slap a comment on a movie saying it's a "classic" when really they can't say in 10 years people will be talking about it. But hey, Hakuna Matata! In the end if you want a luxury of seeing (Arguably) Disneys best film on the big screen than don't hold back. It will really make you feel like a kid for an hour and a half, and also give you witness to Disneys most beautiful masterpiece that isn't just Dinsey's Best, but possibly one of the greatest achievements ever made.....The Lion King!

             I have been watching this film since I was very young and I still enjoy it very much to this day and will never get bored of it! The film manages to fulfil everything you could hope for in an animation film: great visuals, catchy songs, likeable and memorable characters, a villain that you love to hate,unexpected plot twists and more! The Lion King is an amazing film for everyone even those who tend to stay away from animated films. If you haven't watched it already please do! Disney did a fantastic job on this one.

many of their earlier stories; but the combined efforts of Sir Tim Rice, Elton John and Hans Zimmer make this an enjoyable fantasy adventure. It is told in two parts - the first sees a son "Simba" born to the king "Mufasa"; a curious little fella who, alongside his friend "Nala" is inquisitive and mischievous - a real pain in the neck to the king's major-domo "Zazu". One fan the new cub really doesn't have, however, is the king's rather unimpressed brother "Scar" who hatches a plan to depose his brother and take over the kingdom. He manages to achieve exactly this and to get the youngster to blame himself and head off, alone, into exile. The second part is much more fun; he falls in with a warthog and is soon eating colourful grubs and living a peaceful, jolly life far from home. That idyllic existence is not to last long, however - "Nala" discovers he is still alive and races to alert him of the disaster that has befallen the kingdom under the rule of his uncle and his trusty band of hyenas. The musical numbers help it build to a gripping denouement, with clever, quite witty dialogue from some good - though not great - voice talents from the likes of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg to keep the pot boiling. It is an enjoyable film to watch but I wasn't captivated by it.



    They're re-releasing Lion King in 3D for the next two weeks, so I thought it would be a good time to look back on one of Disney's most popular films. All I can say is after watching this movie countless of times as a kid it still holds up today.The story is about a young lion cub named Simba who is next in line to be the king of the jungle. Simba is rather mischievous and gets into trouble a lot with his friend Nala. His uncle Scar is jealous of Simba because he gets to be the king, so he hatches a plan with his Hyena goons to kill Simba and King Mufasa. They succeed in killing Mufasa but Simba escapes and blames himself for Mufasa's death. He goes into exile and meets two jungle bums Timon and Pumbaa. They teach him the Hakuna Matata(no worries) life style and Simba grows up without a care in the world. But the lions in Pride Rock don't have it so good. Scar has let everything go to ruin and is too stubborn to leave to go look for food and water. Nala leaves to find help and finds Simba. She tries to convince him to come home but he still blames himself for Mufasa's death(not knowing it was Scar who killed him to begin with). Simba must now make a decision to either run from his past or challenge Scar to become the next king.I haven't really done the plot justice by paraphrasing it but I'm sure a good many people are already quite familiar with this movie. Everything in it is top notch. The animation, the all-star cast of characters, the epic score by Hans Zimmer and the catchy tunes from Elton John and Tim Rice. Much like the old Disney movies this movie isn't afraid to get dark. There's numerous assassination attempts(one that succeeds), dark themes you wouldn't find in most kid's films nowadays, and a few jokes aimed towards the older audience. What is not to love about this movie? The only bad thing I can think about this film doesn't come from the original edit. It's the song "Morning Report" that comes from the special edition released a few years back. The song worked well for the Broadway show but in the movie it just slows things down and seems unnecessary next to the other songs. But still it doesn't change my opinion of the actual movie. I am going to see it in 3D? Probably. But even if the 3D turns out bad it'll be nice to see what it might have been like to watch it on the big screen.

himself) would be proud of. The Lion King is a good solid story with fun songs and very likable characters. It is one of the funniest Disney animated films ever made. The movie does have some very sad moments as well but it is mainly a good comedy. It's a film that is well suited for the entire family - not just the kids.If you like The Lion King, try these Disney classics out for size: "The Jungle Book", "Bambi", "The Fox and the Hound" or "The AristoCats".I would also like to plug: The Lion King 2 and The Lion King 1 1/2.10/10

The film features a host of interesting, lovable characters and a fantastic plot, with a few lessons to be learnt in there, as well. The musical element in the film is entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable. The animation is wonderful for its time, and the voice overs are done by an exceptional cast, in particular Whoopi Goldberg and Jeremy Irons.This is one to watch again and again, but be sure to have some tissues handy, as well, as the film will make you just as emotional at times as it will make you cry with laughter! The film also has a fantastic score, courtesy of Hans Zimmer.

heartwarming experience not many like it! Phenomenal characters, beautiful colors for its time, great story, and plenty of entertainment. I miss innocent movies like this thanks to Disney plus I can access them again after VHS became obsolete. The Lion King deserves all praise and I generally don't like musicals but this one is a goldmine.

one of the best 2D animation one could see, the movie dialogue is also intriguing and funny, the movie which seems to be in three parts, the first being Simba's life in Pride rock, his life with Timon and Pumbaa where he loses some of his Lion instincts and the last part where he goes back to Pride rock to reclaim his throne. The Lion King was the first Disney animated feature to be a total original story, all other animations before it have been based on an already existing work. The idea of the movie was conceived during the promotion of Oliver & Company, the idea was basic: a story about animals that will be set in Africa. The filmmakers, then went ahead to build the story taking ideas from the lives of Joseph and Moses (from the Bible) and William Shakespeare's Hamlet.The movie production began during the time of the production of Pocahontas, many of the animators and directors at Disney felt that not many people will want to sit and watch a little Lion cub who is framed for murder (murder of his father) by his uncle, for that reason alone many of the animators wanted to work on Pocahontas instead, but to their surprise although both were financially successful, Lion King made more money (it has become the highest grossing 2D animation ever) and received more positive reviews.The voice casting for Lion King, was full of stars from Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg (just to mention a few) and even Disney's long time voice artist Jim Cummings was also available in this unending list of star voice actors.The movie plot of Lion king is about a lion cub named Simba who gets framed for murdering his father (Mufasa voiced by James Earl Jones) by his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons). Simba runs away from his right as heir to the throne and meets and befriends a meerkat, Timon (Nathan Lane) and a warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella). Things were going well but the past that Simba ran from found him where he was hiding and now Simba (Matthew Broderick) has to go back to Pride Rock to face his past.Lion King is a nice animation to own and watch again. Two home video sequels were done of the movie, The Lion King 2 (not worth watching at all) and The Lion King 11/2 (good enough to be seen), and a series about Timon and Pumbaa was also done, which was amusing.www.lagsreviews.com

all time.... this Disney classic has won many awards because it's great. It has everything to make a good film. A setting, characters, plot, and an adventure that makes it the greatest, if not, one of the greatest films of all time history. It is a film that has horror, drama, adventure, comedy, and EVERY GENRE! The horror part comes from the terrifying deaths. But this Disney classic is the greatest movie that Disney ever pulled out of their pocket. I recommend everybody sees this amazing movie. Obviously the greatest film of 1994 and even possibly the best film of the 90's. It has no reason to be skipped or given a bad rating, this movie does have many sequels but they're pretty bad, this is the one you should be focusing on.

                                                             I love Disney always have and probably always will. But The Lion King in many ways stands out from the rest. And it's not just cause the prince is a lion. You feel the pain and hurt and betrayal along with Simba. You learn and grow along with Simba. You love along with Simba. As with most Disney animals their facial expressions say more than words could say and when Timon laughs about the Kings of the past being in the stars, Simba really needs to say nothing at all. It's all there written in his face and they way he carries himself as he leaves. It's almost a coming of age story. As a young cub he had the world at his paws. Then he sees it slip away with the death of his father and being driven out by the hyenas. Only to later on come back and see that Pride Rock is really home and fight for what is rightfully his. Pop some popcorn and sit back, relax and enjoy!

                                                                                                                                                                                                      I wish Walt Disney was alive to see this, he would of loved it! This is probably the ultimate Disney movie. What makes the Disney movies so great are how they take themselves so seriously despite being a kids cartoon. I don't care how old you are but you're be lying if you said this movie didn't move you. This movie is similar to Disney's 2nd greatest film, Bambi. They both begin with the birth of an animal who is destined to be king of his domain, they both lose one of their parents, and the story ends with them both taking their place as king. The film's also a lot like Shakesphere's Hamlet, a story about a man who kills his own brother so he can be king. In fact, this is the first original Disney story and what a great story it is. In Disney's tradition the animation is fantastic and realistic looking. The African landscape looks awesome and very detailed. I love the idea of a lion king, because we are know lions are the king of the jungle. So take a lion king, Bambi, hamlet, and you got your self a good story. But every story needs good characters and in the tradition of classic Disney movies this has a lot of good characters. I love James Earl Jones as Moffassa, his voice is perfect for the role. He sounds authoritative and loving. Simba, the star of the story, is likable and sympathetic. You feel for him and root for him. You can't help but to love Timon & Pumba and they provide good comic relief. The hyenas are likable, even though their bad. But Shenzi, Bonzi and ED are not as evil as Scar, but are mostly indifferent, they only care about their own self interest. I wish they would've done a spin-off with the hyenas like they did with Timon & Pumba. Then there's Scar, who has to be the most evil villain in any Disney movie. I also think he is an underrated villain, I mean I never see his name on any "greatest villain list", he's one of the best villains ever! He killed his own brother, tried to kill his nephew, made his nephew think that he killed his father, and lied to everyone in pride rock! In fact, he might be too dark for little kids. The music is great, and I know sometime it's hard to sit through musicals, but the songs fit well into the story. And how can you not love the "Akuta Motta" song! That song's my philosophy too, I believe in "No worries for the rest of your days!" But the best song, hands down is "circle of life". Written by Elton John and sung by Carmen Twillie. If the movie dosen't move you, the song will. In fact, that's what makes this movie really epic, is the underlying theme about the circle of life and I like how the movie came full circle at the end of the story, ending how the film began! The lyrics are great! "It's the circle of life, and it moves us all, through faith and hope, through despair and love, until we find our way on the path unwinding, in the circle of life!" This film has the best opening of any movie, it's truly epic. The only problem I have with this movie, is how the story gets a little convoluted towards the end, but that's because they had a lot of story they were trying to wrap up. And I also think it's funny how were in Africa but Simba sounds American, Scar sounds English and Rafiki sounds Jamecain, or how that Buffalo stamp peed went on forever. The directors Roger Allers & Rob Minkoff did a fantastic job, on this timeless classic!

The betrayal, the death, the relationship with son and father: all these themes are pretty adult and can make some adult people happy to see this movie. Its pretty entertaining and give some lesson too.

                                       After 12 years I re-watched its DVD version and I still love it. It's simple, straightforward but excellent for everyone.Simba, a young lion, is going to be the future king. But his vicious uncle, Scar, who is so jealous of him and his father, Mufasa, cooperates with the Hyenas, kills Mufasa and makes Simba leave guiltily. After years Simba has grown up and met his best friend, Nala, again and decides not to escape from his guilt any more.Music is always Disney's strength and it's particular good in this film. The songs has already become classics and it's really cheering when you listen to them. With them you just don't feel like watching the film for one and a half hours.The message is very positive. Disney makes use of the impression the public has of lions to show that even someone really strong can be weak sometime. No matter what has come what you should do is face it and deal with it but not run away from it.This is one of the best Disney's animations and I'm sure both adult and children will enjoy the story and music and won't get bored even if you watch it for a few times.

movie is worth watching just for the music. The beginning (also optically beautiful) still gives me goosebumps. If anyone ever deserved the Oscar, it was the two guys who got it for this one! Though it's wonderful entertainment, the film also contains some serious topics, like death, taking responsibility and coping with the past. The characters are charming, the romance between Simba and Nala is really cute, and the song lyrics are worth listening twice.A little warning to parents: as I said, this is a perfect Disney classic and really recommendable to both adults and children - only not for very young ones. The scene of Mufasa's death is very sad and touching, and Scar's and Simba's fight at the end could be considered scary.

Even though it is technically an original story by Disney, I personally consider it the definitive version of Shakespeare's Hamlet. And they don't even sugar coat it that much. Not like in Bambi, where they just hint at the mother dying. Here you actually SEE the body. The characters are all likable, all the way down to the two best, Timon and Pumbaa. As a kid, I always found them incredibly funny. The villain is probably for me the best Disney has ever done as well. Scar really has that clever acting of Jeremy Irons and his interaction with James Earl Jones is extremely believable. And I real like the clever message it's sending through the scene with Rafiki and Simba. "The past can hurt. But the way I see it you can either run from it or... learn from it." The songs are all memorable, even down to my favorite "Circle of Life" and the animation is a brilliant combination of traditional with a little CG thrown here or there. God bless this movie. It is nothing short of an epic masterpiece.

it's his own fault. Surely this is even more traumatic than the death of Bambi's mother. And yet, I have to rank this as one of Disney's very best--the color, design, characterizations,and music are all superb. The use of earth tones, so different from Disney's usual bright palette, is stunning and perfect for the story. (And here I want to add that the soundtrack is also excellent--my only quibble being that the powerful "Circle Of Life" should have won for best song instead of the pretty but vapid "Can You Feel the Love Tonight?". But that being said, I believe that, like "Beauty and the Beast," should have been nominated as picture of the year. If you haven't seen this, what are waiting for?--arnie113_________________________

The A-team was working on Pocahontas, which was supposed to be their ultimate magnum opus, their new Sleeping Beauty, which would set the standard for animated movie greatness. Whereas the B-team was working on The Lion King, to give the audiences something to tide them over until Pocahontas would sweep them off their feet.It's funny how these things work out sometimes. How blind people can be to their own work.Because The Lion King was huge when it came out. It was a cultural phenomenon equally as groundbreaking as Jurassic Park a year earlier, and Disney would have to wait almost two decades until Frozen came along to achieve the same kind of wall to wall cultural hype that followed this movie from day one. And you know what? It earned that hype and recognition. It is a masterpiece, one of those perfect films that populate people's top lists. And it doesn't earn that through harsh themes, dark characters and cold, realistic truths about the human condition. It has those, being one of the most mature Disney films ever made, but at its core it's a movie about triumph, about accepting responsibility, about the fact that it's okay to be afraid, shocked and ashamed, but that at some point you have to\u0085 well, let it go.It's also one of the most colourful Disney films, with an amazing cast of identifiable, likable and instantly recognizable characters. All of its songs are born classics, the sound design in general is phenomenal, as is the voice acting. The story flows seamlessly and goes to some pretty dark places for an animated family film, but it never feels like it's unfair or doing it for the wrong reasons. It has dark scenes and themes because at some point kids need learn about them, and this is the perfect film to teach them.The Lion King is my favourite Disney film. Has always been. It taught me that what I did or, even more importantly, didn't do affected not just me but all those around me. It taught me that those around me affect me as well and I should be respectful of the fact, of those connections. It taught me about bravery, friendship and family. It taught me that sometime truths can be used to manipulate people and that sometimes a lie is the sweetest truth there is. It is an important part of who I am today, and because of that it has my respect and love.
## 123 Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff debuted in feature films addressing this timeless story and dramatic, discussing loss, family relationship, inspired courage and honor in the play Hamlet by William Shakespeare, the movie Bambi, and the stories of Joseph and Moses, the Bible, and without forgetting the traditional moral message of Disney to your audience. The studio brought together more than 800 artists across three continents, who worked three years to create a story of love, friendship, courage and teachings that enchanted the world. Only the creative part, the film proves to be one of the great examples of collaboration in your script, with almost 30 professionals who helped in creating the plot, which had as main writers trio Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton.The quality of the animation is a unique treatment, emphasizing the full power of Disney to represent the entire African savanna, a scene never before explored in animations. For both the studio took about three years in the production of the film.Another great merit of encouraging merge was wild with human bodily expressions, especially in animals over humans as Zazu, Scar and Timon (probably because they are the most cowardly and rational characters). Zazu crosses wings, holds the bars of his cage and has very human facial expressions. Scar gestures legs and caresses Simba gestures typically human. Timon is the clearest example. He exaggerated gestures, crosses his legs, among other various facial expressions. At some point - when Simba is to be reprimanded by her father after he disobeyed and went to the Elephant Graveyard - he is afraid of his father and lowers the tail and ears and walks with a stooped posture. Soon after, when they play, both assume new postures amid wild somersaults and bites. The other characters show humanity in its looks and typically human care, such as when the mother of Simba, Sarabi, conversation with the mother of Nala allowing them to walk around, but accompanied by Zazu, demonstrating the inherent concern as mothers.The characters, however, are the secret of the plot. Besides the technique with which they were made, their personalities are captivating, and helped a lot by excellent team of voice actors. Zazu, voiced by Rowan Atkinson - Mr. Bean's famous - is the faithful servant of King Mufasa, that puts all confidence in the bird. Atkinson lends distinctive voice and mannerisms comedic giving a unique personality to the character. James Earl Jones with his distinctive voice is the one who gives life to Mufasa. The actor - who is also the voice of Darth Vader in "Star Wars" - is the ideal choice for the majesty of the king of the jungle. The character always keeps a didactic discourse during the movie. His strong voice while loving, especially in the speeches with Simba are some of the best moments. The life lessons he gives Simba directly reflect the audience and only serve to further admire the great king and to engage deeply in the episode of his death. This scene, by the way, is one of the most remembered and have become classic to the seventh art. Jeremy Irons is one that is flawless. Always maintaining a drawling voice, dramatic and that suits the way slim, lazy and treacherous brother Mufasa. Jonathan Taylor Thomas plays a charming Simba, a young lion that giving all the curious spirit of age. Simba is adventurous, curious, fearless, dreamy, loving, but like every kid, just getting into danger by their desire to become king soon, and do not listen to the advice of elders. But above all, he loves his parents. When Simba grows, Matthew Broderick is who dubs the character, managing to convey a lack of confidence and existential doubt that the character felt in much of the film. Robert Guillaume is another that stands voicing the wise Rafiki. Even just appearing on the scene, notice the careful composition of the character, where the actor has a voice that comes to intelligence, life experience and mysticism fundamental to the character. Rafiki is essential to teach Simba to deal with the pain, death and guilt, and thus overcome them. Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings dub the three hyenas, Shenzi, Banzai and Ed. Despite being allies of the villain, hyenas can be threatening when put in correctly closes the directors, but also pluck laughter in the audience through his own laughter, especially Jim Cummings as EdBut the highlights are even worshiped boar meerkat Timon and Pumba. The duo was so successful that the characters have earned their own series produced between 1995 and 1999. Nathan Lanee Ernie Sabella as Timon and Pumbaa respectively, are of fundamental importance to increase the air comic plot and being the great family support Simba during their growth phase. Timon is remarkable for its high ironic, selfish, fragile, while Pumbaa is strong, has a deep voice and imposing and yet is naiver than Timon. The reversal of character between the two that constrastam with their physical is what most pleases. The pair of friends teaches Simba to live through Hakuna Matata (no problem) and are the protagonists of the funniest scenes of the projection, and it is implied that the overcoming of the problems is only possible when we have friends who support us.Few people know that The Lion King was one of the pioneers in introducing the use of CG in their scenes. The photograph used with intelligence knows lighting, giving bright scenes during the day a cheerful and harmonious shared by all. But when we witness the scenes that take place in the Cemetery of the Elephants, the scenes are more bleak, cold, dark and depict well the danger that those who dare to enter the site submit. This play of light is efficiently used all the time. We can repair all the time that Mufasa and the other characters of the good are always bright and impressive. It is clear the importance given to the nature and animals, implying that large from ants to elephants are vital and equal to the life cycle of endless work and stay in constant balance. Scar already on the other hand, as hyenas, is always in shadow. The timing of this is clearer when Scar, taking advantage of the innocence of his nephew and hungry hyenas and ignorant to achieve its goal of assuming the throne, reigns with tyranny emerging in his kingdom of darkness new times. We note the kingdom with a less grandiose landscape, darker, melancholic, even where the lionesses do have to go hunting in search of scarce food. Still, Scar is unable to recover the devastation that his government has caused to the ecosystem, denoting a mood of unhappiness and tyranny, contrasting totally with the times of the reign fair, balanced and harmonious with the nature of Mufasa.Another significant moment in the use of colors and lighting is the meeting Simba and Nala, where we can see a color that reflects the love between the two, even after years without seeing each other. Incidentally, it is interesting to climate change in a few minutes in this sequence. After this most romantic moment involving music, we have a brief discussion between Simba and Nala, and he soon after walking through a long and winding path that we all must pass to find our true destiny. This track is represented full of twigs and night lighting has to expand this idea of being lost until the moment we find our personal responses, the end of this track, with the help of Rafiki and the image of his father, he finally finds his place in the world and seeking to resume his leadership of the kingdom.As mentioned briefly before, the soundtrack is another outstanding feature. The German master Hans Zimmer (Days of Thunder (1990), Thelma & Louise (1991), True Romance (1993)) consists here perhaps his first major commercial success of many others that would. The instrumental track known to be lively and dramatic moments in the prone, involving the viewer in an impressive way. The integration of the track to what we see happening is magic. A beautiful instrumental music is 'Under the Stars'. Zimmer manages to be light and happy all the time. But when Scar appears on the scene we can see a trail darker accompanying color changes and shadows in scenes. Already on track sung, we also adding musicians like Elton John and Tim Rice as important contributors. Among the tracks are: 'Circle of Life', 'I Just Can not Wait to be King', 'Be Prepared', 'Hakuna Matata', 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight?'. They are all beautiful songs and working with the narrative, often telling the feelings of the characters at any given time. Oscar in 1995, the five songs that competed in the category for best song, three were of the Disney movie 'Circle of Life', 'Hakuna Matata' and the big winner, 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight'. The same categories were also winners in Oscar winning at the Golden Globes in the same year. And Hans Zimmer won best soundtrack, as was to be expected.The Lion King is the legitimate representative of the Golden Age of Disney, full of endearing characters, with traditional and efficient lessons of life, ethics and morals of the company, with a history well based, fun and exciting, it values ties family, respect for hierarchy, and respectful and harmonious coexistence among the different beings. A big show of animation that marked a generation. Viva the Great King of the Jungle and Hakuna Matata!

         I hadn't thought much of The Lion King back then because I'd watch anything. But now that I'm older, I can see why many people agree that it's one of the best movies, and I agree. There may be spoilers ahead, so you have been warned.The animation's great, I really like the songs (especially Circle Of Life and Be Prepared), and I also like the characters (like Mufasa, Rafiki, and Timon and Pumbaa). Out of Disney's protagonists, I feel that Simba's story is one that'll always be told for many years to come. From a cub who can't wait to be king to an exiled prince whose father had been killed by his uncle and finally to be a king, retaking the Pridelands from his cruel uncle Scar. This movie has some hidden good values as well, such as heroism, faith, hope, and reconciliation.That's why I think that The Lion King is not only one of the best Disney movies, but it's also one of the best animated movies ever. So on a scale from one to ten, I'd give it a perfect ten, and I'd definitely recommend this...and even though The Lion King (1994) will always be better than The Lion King (2019), I hope the remake will be good.

cream. Since the original film opened 17 years ago the film has taken $4.6 billion worldwide and has spawned one of the most successful shows in Broadway history.With such success one could be forgiven for thinking that the film's new release in 3D was just Disney finding a way of milking a successful franchise. Yet with The Lion King it doesn't feel this way.The story deserves to be told again for a new audience. Those who grew up with this film will perhaps now have children of their own, or merely want to escape back to their childhood. Either way The Lion King has aged well, the story is as compelling, as emotional and as funny as ever.This stems from its characters, the story's moral heart and the performances which bring it all to life. Watch any other Disney film and you will struggle to find a character as evil as Scar, nor a scene as moving as Simba's last with his father Mufasa. The cast including Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg, Matthew Broderick and Rowan Atkinson deliver each line with relish.Yet at the risk of stating the obvious, it is Hans Zimmer's soundtrack and Elton John/Tim Rice's songs which really makes the film sing. People across the world may know the words to "Hakuna Matata", "I Just Can't Wait To Be King" and "Can You Feel The Love Tonight?", but what's forgotten is how important they are to the story and how well the whole film fits together with its musical moments.However despite its status as a timeless classic 3D doesn't work particularly well with the 2D animations of old Disney films. For a start the characters still sing about a circle of life rather than a sphere. To be serious, if you watch this film expecting to have to cower to avoid a herd of wildebeest then you'll be disappointed.But the 3D does have its own charms, different to other 3D films. There is theatricality about this version of The Lion King that allows you to take in the beauty of the African backdrop whilst still focussing on the story front of stage. It makes each scene's colours more vibrant, stopping a brilliant story beginning to look visually tired and old.Despite the fact that The Lion King came out 17 years ago, watching this reissue feels like a new release. That is partly due to the facelift Disney has given it but really it is because it was such a good film in the first place. For that alone watching Simba's journey again is well worthwhile.Verdict: \u0095\u0095\u0095\u0095 With a story this good Disney could do little wrong and they haven't.For more reviews read http://www.theupcoming.co.uk

This movie has been a part of my life since I was an infant. I am now 18, which has given me plenty of time to ponder why this film has been and continues to be a huge success. I think it's so popular for one reason: It appeals to both young and old film viewers, and here's why.First, for kids, it has great music, it's funny, and has great characters, voiced by an extraordinary cast, which are qualities that make a great animated film. It's easy for an animated film to entertain children, but it's really something when adults are touched by it as well. I think one of the reasons adults like this movie so much is that it does not act like a children's film. It acts like a drama made for adults. The plot is fairly simple, but its themes, emotion, and the psychology of the characters within are things that only mature audiences will truly understand. The plot is basically about a young cub, named Simba. He loves his father, Mufasa, is eager to become king one day, and is fascinated by all he sees and hears. His life takes a very bad turn when his uncle, Scar, kills his father in order to gain the throne. He sends the cub into exile. Simba meets some new friends, Timon and Pumbaa, who raise him with a no worries lifestyle until his best friend from home, Nala, and a wise baboon, Rafiki, encourage him to return home and claim his rightful place as king. As I said, this plot is very basic. However, what is not so basic is the feelings of guilt that Simba feels for the death of his father and the psychological trauma that he has to endure for the rest of the film. Again, what is not so simple is the themes. Simba's father appears to him in the clouds and tells him "Remember who you are." This message basically states that a person cannot shirk their responsibilities, a message that a toddler cannot begin to understand. In addition to that, the film sums up what life is all about: Going through hard times, dealing with it, and coming out stronger because you endured it. I think the adults that watch this film grasp that concept and appreciate it. My own grandmother, who's in her eighties, bought her own copy of this film!In addition to these things, the film has other elements that cannot be ignored. The first is definitely the wonderful music and songs. Hans Zimmer made the score for this film and won a much deserved Oscar for it. Elton John and Tim Rice also won Oscars for their brilliant work on this film. The songs that they created, like Circle of Life, Hakuna Matata, and Can You Feel the Love Tonight, are so well written that you can't help but be touched by them. The African words sung by Lebo M. contribute highly to the majesty of the film. When Lebo's team first sings, you automatically know that you're in Africa. From his birth to his ascension as king, Simba's journey is wondrously captured through the music and songs that the film provides. Another thing that makes this film so wonderful is the animation. Every single tree, animal, and background that appears on the screen is a stunning work of art. People that do not like this movie will usually admit that the animation is absolutely stunning. It has to be wonderful when the animators actually went to Africa and brought lions into their studio! While all of the other things about this film are wonderful, my personal favorite is the villain, Scar. He is so wonderfully voiced, animated, and brought to life that you love him, hate him, and may even be scared by him all at once. Jeremy Irons, Andreas Deja, and everyone else who worked on this character created one of the best villains in film history. He is the only animated villain to be nominated for an MTV best villain award, and is widely considered to be one of the best Disney villains of all time. Scar is so magnificent that he is in the same category with Hannibal Lecter and Ledger's Joker. The Lion King has many wonderful things that make it spectacular, but, for me, it would not be the same without Scar. A very close second to Scar is Mufasa. He is so incredibly voiced that I cannot imagine anyone else playing him. James Earl Jones brings the qualities of a commanding leader and a wonderful, loving father at the same time to this character that you can't help but feel sad when he is killed. These two characters alone make the film worth seeing. Add everything else that is great about it, and you have one of the best films ever made.The Lion King has been entertaining audiences for 17 years and will do so for many years more. With its great vocal talent, animation, songs, music, and themes, the Lion King has earned its spot in IMDb's top 250 films ever made. I do not thing it will be leaving the list any time soon. It's a real shame that it was not nominated for best picture. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wishes to see a children's film that goes beyond the typical feel good animated film. With the possible exception of Beauty and the Beast, this is definitely the King of all animated films! If you haven't seen it, in 2D or 3D, I strongly encourage you to do so. You won't regret it!

As it is not just a great movie for animation buffs. But also for the entire family. As it is one of the best movies ever made and no wonder it is really a hit with the IMDb 250 best top movies.The protagonist Simba, after being ran out of his homeland of Pride Rock, from the antagonist, Scar. After Scar was jealous of Simba's father Mufasa, who was king. Therefore he has the hyenas kill him so that Scar can be king after Mufasa was thrown to his death.After Simba who really would be king after he grew up runs into the two comic reliefs of the film, Timon a meerkat and Pumbaa a warthog. And lives the carefree lifestyle of "Hakuna Matata!" After a former girlfriend of his, Nala whom he rescues his new friends from. Is informed of Scar's being king and not enough food or resources due to Scar's hoarding it to himself and the hyenas.Now faced with this and with the help also of his wise mentor, mandrill Rafiki as Simba must face Scar and take his rightful place as king.Really one of the best movies I have ever seen! Even my parents, whom my dad is not a fan into cartoon movies loved it too.About love and hope and also with humor along the way!

One of the best films in history.I don't find many films perfect, but this is one of those. So many people say this is still as powerful as it was when it was released and I agree. Obviously because of the story, the lesson and the always timely themes. But not only that. This film is a miracle in the way that is never too adult for a child and never too childish for an adult and that is one of it's biggest achievements that I don't see in many animated films.Every character has a strong identity and arc, every single scene works, every song is beautiful and memorable (these could have all the nods for best song in a year), every line thoughtful and/or funny, always masterfully crafted with a perfect pace, great direction and flawless editing.I'm Portuguese, so the PT/PT version is the one that makes me more excited and I enjoy the most, so, even if I've watched the original voices and liked it, nothing beats the feeling of hearing the fantastic dub made by these Portuguese artists, probably the best PT/PT version of any film in history.Disney made some of the best animated films in history. They were always able to put on screen stories that are simultaneously interesting, funny, full of meaning and relatable, however, there is no other on this level. And yes, this was the first film that made me cry. And I'm proud that it was with such a great film!

Lion King" is essentially a retelling of "Hamlet" set on the Savannah and casted with lions. Simba (Prince Hamlet) is the child of Mufasa (King Hamlet) and Sarabi (Gertrude), the heir apparent of the Savannah. His uncle Scar (Claudius), however, has ambitions for the throne. Aligning himself with a pack of hyenas, Scar succeeds in killing his brother and taking the throne for himself. The Hyenas, unable to kill Simba, chase him into a desert and leave him for dead. He grows up mentored by the meerkat Timon (Rosencrantz) and the warthog Pumba (Guildenstern) until Nala (Ophelia), a childhood friend, finds him and convinces him to return home and take his place as king.Despite abundant opportunities to become a derivative child-friendly adaptation of the Shakespeare play, "The Lion King" succeeds as a unique and family-friendly experience. It conveys the emotions of tragic loss and unforgivable betrayal that, while devastating and heartbreaking, are still appropriate for the entire family. Even moreso than Bambi's mother's, Mufasa's death is a heartrenching experience (and I am not above admitting that I cried watching Simba search for his father in the deserted gorge in which he died).The animation is easily the most breathtaking of Disney's 2-D features: brilliantly capturing the majesty of the African Savannah. The Pride Lands are bright and crisp while the elephant graveyard is nightmarishly grim. The landscape upon Simba's return is nothing short of haunting.The film demonstrates an elegant mastery of visual symbolism rare in films produced since the early sixties. The song "Be Prepared" contains evocative visual allusions to the Third Reich, aligning Scar's reign with that of Hitler's. Gothic tradition holds that the natural world is a reflection of the social order; as such, the barren Pride Lands, littered with bones and scorched flora, with bent, stunted trees in the foreground reflects the unnatural ascension of Scar to the throne. In a moment of catharsis etched into every child's memory, the post-battle rain washes away the last remnants of Scar's reign, cleansing the Pride Lands and its inhabitants.A host of prominent actors lend their vocal talents to this film, including the James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg. Elton John rounds out the vocal ensemble, lending his voice to a number of Tim Rice's exceptional musical numbers.This is film is a true classic and easy to for all viewers, young and old, to enjoy together. It is a rare person who will not find something to like in it (genuinely funny quips, thrilling musical numbers, well-crafted script, exceptional voice talents). If you get the slightest opportunity to see this film, I recommend that you take it.

score. Like all great movies, the sum of it's parts make it greater that it's whole. Great characterizations by amazing voice actors. Terrific story-line, although shamelessly borrowed from several literary sources, including Shakespeare! A truly disturbing death scene when Mufasa, the Lion King, dies. (Shades of Bambi!) Tim Rice and Elton John wrote very memorable songs, indeed. Classic intricately detailed ink-and-paint 2D animation at it's best. James Earl Jones in one of his best roles ever. Probably not recommend for very young children due to a few intense scenes, although mixed in with much humor and majesty. Whoopie Goldberg steals the scene (like she does in most of her movies) as a very outspoken hyena. Just wonderful.

music, the delicious animation and the wonderful drawings, the superb acting with Mufasa on top and of course the great story this movie tells: it's about life and its stages, the hardness of loss and the difficulty in changing, it's about not running away from your problems, about believing in yourself, about evil, friendship, justice and love...In the 90s Disney movies got an unusual balance: the stories weren't yet the postmodern crap we have today and they had overcome the rancidity from before. The technology was still paper and pencil and the brand new technologies were just used to create epic scenes from scratch. It's not strange that from The little Mermaid (1989) to Tarzan (1999) it was Disney's second youth and just at the half of the decade they peaked with The Lion King (1994).If in 2017 we see Bambi (1942) as a timeless classic I'm sure that in 2070 people will see The Lion King the same way. And that is huge

when the conversation comes to films. After years of missed chances I finally managed to close this hole. Of course, as far as I can tell, I'm not exactly the peer group for this title, so I won't be judging too hard.The movie tells a nice story. One of those typical stories of good and evil, betrayal and loyalty and the difficulties of finding yourself. Wouldn't it be for the animals, it could as well be some historical drama. Whilest you don't get bored, partly due to the humorous sidekicks, the plot in itself is not really all to innovative.The big strength of the film is in my eyes the soundtrack, that produced quite a few classics that even I could recall. Singing in movies is always a risky thing but in this case reminds me of the old day Disney movies, where singing was almost something like a brand mark."The Lion King" is short, but I'm sure children will be able to fall in love with the exceptionally drawn characters quite easily and therefor have their fun. Personally, I didn't quite see why this particular title has so much more credit than many other comparable movies but it entertained me well for an evening.

be reviewing Disney classics from the past. One of them is The lion king. A smart, funny, sad animated feature. Surely it isn't as good as Beauty and the beast, but it is still a lovable tale of excitement.The lion king is the story of Simba(voiced by Johnathon Taylor Thomas). When Simba is born, it is announced that he will become king if his father(voiced by James Earl Jones) dies. The king's brother Scar(voiced by the great Jeremy Irons) isn't happy because he knows that he'll never be king.So Scar pulls off an evil scheme and tricks Simba into believing that he is a murderer. So Simba runs off and Scar takes over. Later on in life, we see Simba(now voiced by Matthew Broderick)hanging around with Timone and Pumba(Timone is voiced by Nathan Lane). Also, when an old friend of Simba's walks back into his life he realizes many things. He also realizes what he must do.The lion king isn't as good as Beauty and the beast or something like that. But it is indeed a great movie. It's a movie that you'll never forget. The characters are never going to be forgotten either. The lion king is a fantastic movie.The lion king:****/****

Well The Lion King is really an excellent animation, it is top 5 of Disney without doubt, the plot is good, the characters are cool, the animation has exciting moments, the quality is excellent, the soundtrack is incredible, but I admit that it had moments James Earl Jones is as impeccable as Mufasa, but he is a very good actor, and he is a great actor, Matthew Broderick, Madge Sinclair, Rowan Atkinson, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Whoopi Goldberg and so on are all impeccable, The Lion King is a great animation with great and exciting moments and a great ending and an unforgettable opening.

I mean, who hasn't seen this movie yet? If by some extraordinary circumstances you're one of those unlucky souls, stop. Spend the next hour and a half watching this animated masterpiece and come back here. I will still avoid mentioning key details because I'm just used to it, and The Lion King has so many things to compliment that I don't really need to get in-depth on spoilers. So, in case you haven't notice it through my Twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews, The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time (animated or not)!I rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend, and I cried more than when I was just a child. That's how much this movie means to me. The sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tear-inducing aspects that I can't simply avoid. I literally cried (waterfalls) in four (!) different scenes. The opening sequence (Circle of Life) filled my eyes with nostalgia's tears. Mufasa's tragic moment obviously wrecked me (one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema). Simba receiving the whole "remember who you are" speech from Mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing. Finally, one of the last scenes, Simba climbing his way to the top of Pride Rock with Hans Zimmer's score, leaving me absolutely destroyed.And I want to pick up on that last aspect: the score. It's one of the most crucial technical features of a film, in my opinion. It can transform an "okay" scene into something magical or something pretty terrible, depending on what kind of score it is. Consequently, it can make a "good" movie turn into a "great" one. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever. His soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe. Even if the film itself isn't that good, his scores are still able to elevate it in some way. The Lion King is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is, even in the subtlest moments.During the stampede sequence, the score doesn't lend you time to breathe. Its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat, waiting for it to be over. Then, when Simba descends and approaches his dad, the score is so subtle. Completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound. It's that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry. In the last scene that I mentioned above, it's solely the score that brings in the chill-inducing tears. If Simba climbed Pride Rock with no soundtrack, it would just be a good ending. However, from the exact moment that the score fades in, it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale. The slow-motion walk to the top, the immersive score, Simba's roar ... Damn it, I'm crying again!The animation is some of Disney's best. It's not by chance that the Disney Renaissance Era (1989-1999), which was the return to form by Disney, has the best animation quality of its history, and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyone's childhood. Its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters. There's no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what they're feeling. The wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyone's wallpaper even today.The songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation. Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, ... Every single song is someone's favorite. The voice work is perfect. James Earl Jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his career's biggest role, Darth Vader isn't the obvious choice. Jeremy Irons and his raspy voice elevate Scar as the villainous character. If you close your eyes and only hear every character's voice, without having watched the film previously, you can easily identify who's the "bad guy", and that's unbelievably good. Everyone else is amazing, but these two gentlemen are astonishing, and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles.Nevertheless, in the end, the two pillars of every movie always matter the most: story and characters. The Lion King has an especially compelling screenplay, one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss, but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears. It's true that most people cry watching this film, but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied Simba's journey. From being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed, while also making his father extremely proud. Even though it's a very tragic movie, Timon and Pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some well-needed laughs. Their laid-back lifestyle is something that everyone desires, but when you have responsibilities, you can't just hide from them. You must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be, without losing the essence of who you are.It's a masterpiece! It doesn't matter if it's an animated film. It doesn't matter if it was "made for kids". People need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else. If parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well, maybe the world would be a better place. The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time, and it's undeniably one of Disney's best original movies. From the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score, from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey Simba goes through, from the chill-inducing tearful moments to the loud laughs ... The Lion King is just perfect. Hopefully, its "live-action" remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again.

                                 Great-looking but preachy, "uplifting" Disney animated opus from an original story concerns a young jungle lion who has gone into a sort of self-imposed exile after blaming himself for his father's demise, soon befriended by two clowning creatures who help teach the cub about Life. Fine voice-work from Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg, James Earl Jones and Nathan Lane, many exciting and amusing moments, but nearly left sodden by a cloying, sugary song-score by Elton John and Tim Rice, with every tune underlining the "message" inherent in each sequence. Much of the talk is just Psychobabble 101, making the last fifteen or so minutes a chore to get through. The craftsmanship of the film's designers is really something to see, despite the fact the picture only won Oscars for its music (the score and the song, "Can You Feel The Love Tonight", which sounds like a commercial jingle). **1/2 from ****

                                                The Lion King is one of the Greatest Cartoon ever released. It has a amazing storyline, with fun characters. The Lion King is a non stop entertainer with a serious storyline. Bambi is regarded one of the serious cartoons. But in my opinion Lion King is 100 times better. It is generally better then the classic cartoons like Aladin, Shrek and Incredibles. Lion King has a Multi starrer cast for the voices of the characters. There are 2 sequels of Lion King. Part Two was quite boring continuing Simba's adventure. Part three was another part one in the eyes of Timon and Pumbaa. They are the funniest characters in this cartoon. This is a MUST SEE, even if you are not fond of cartoons.

                                                Disney's masterpiece destined to be worshiped for the future generations. 1994 and here we are, witnessing the spectacle that the cycle of life represents, decades passing by and souls maturing. Yes, they are animals, but that's the point. The world's creation is futile in its banal self-destructiveness, but miraculous in its varied colors, instincts and traits. This is a unique feature film for animation capable of rising all kinds of sentiments to the surface at an exotic rhythm.

Then, after making a few animated shorts, they made their very first full length feature film "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" based on a fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm. When it was first released, it was well-received globally from critics and audiences and started the trend, thus making the genre very successful. When Walt Disney died in 1966, however, Disney went towards the Dark Ages and were trying to find a way to get them back on track. Then, in 1989, when The Little Mermaid was released and became a hit, they started their new trend known as the Disney Renaissance with The Rescuers Down Under, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin. However, the only Renaissance film that was considered to be the most successful was this, "The Lion King", an anthropomorphic African feature film based on the religious stories of Joseph and Moses and also based on the Shakespearean play Hamlet.It tells the story about a young cub named Simba who's destined to become king of the jungle. However, his evil ruthless uncle Scar kills Simba's father Mufasa in a stampede of wildebeests and blames it on Simba, causing him to run away from Pride Rock. A few years later, after meeting two comic-relief sidekicks named Timon and Pumbaa, Simba grows up, away from responsibility. However, a wise baboon named Rafiki informs Simba that he has to take responsibility and return to Pride Rock to set things right.With that said, I want to sum up this film in only one word: fantastic. Not only is it one of Disney's best since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Bambi, Beauty and the Beast, and so on and so forth, but it's one of the best Disney Renaissance films, period. Thanks to it's reviews on Rottentomatoes, there are a lot of good things to say about it.The story is extremely compelling. Not only does it expand on the world it's created in Africa and it's Mythos, perfectly, but it does a great job at sending really good morals about responsibility and facing your past. Also, the mixture of comical moments along with some really dark ones (consider how this had a darker tone like "The Black Cauldron" and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" two years later) are blended perfectly to make it appeal to a family audience and it shows. Oh, and I also forgot to mention that this film has a notable scene where Simba cries over the death of his father, Mufasa and I gotta tell you, it made me shed some tears. No, really. I did.Anyway, the animation is breathtakingly beautiful. The world of Africa, Pride Rock, the Pride Lands, Scar's lair, the Elephant Graveyard, the Stampede scene, and the African Jungle where Timon and Pumbaa live are beautiful to look at even by 2D animation standards. Also, the character animation and designs are amazing and the facial expressions in them are solid.As for the characters, they're very likable. Simba, both child and adult, is nice it made me relate to him, Nala is also a good character both child and adult as well. The comic reliefs are also good. Timon and Pumbaa are extremely funny as is their chemistry together, Zazu is a very funny bird, and the three hyenas, Shenzai, Banzai, and Ed are laugh-out-loud hilarious. The characters that standout the most, however, would have to go to Mufasa, the intimidating, but wise father, Rafiki, the also wise baboon, and Scar, the ruthless uncle with great motives that explains why he wants to rule all of Pride Rock. The voice acting is top-notch with a killer cast including James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, and Matthew Broderick.The third and last thing would have to go to the music score from Hans Zimmer. This is the film that introduced me to this guy when I was a kid and I listened to his other scores for future movies such as the The Prince of Egypt, the Dark Knight Trilogy, the two Kung Fu Panda films, and Man of Steel (all of which were beautiful and solid that made those movies worth it). His score here, like the films that preceded this, is beautiful and compelling. It has an African choir, it helps represent the themes perfectly and the action music is thrilling it would send chills down your spine. The songs, written by Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, are wonderful and will always be timeless. The Circle of Life opens the film very brilliantly, I Just Can't Wait To Be King is good with an upbeat tone, Be Prepared, a creepy, but spine-tingly awesome, Hakuna Matata is a pretty good comedy song that means no worries to me, & Can You Feel The Love Tonight is a solid romance song that represents Simba's relationship with Nala very well.Overall, The Lion King has been a childhood favorite of mine and as a young adult, it still holds up along with Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and all of the other Disney films in the past. It's compelling, it's epic, it's beautiful, and it's a sight that you'll never want to miss. To those who are Disney fans, go watch it. To those who aren't, however, still go watch it. A solid recommendation! :)

                                        For a long time I have been deeply thinking about what I really think of The Lion King. After watching all the animated Disney movies I can see its brilliance, even though it isn't a personal favorite of mine and there are other animated Disney movies I think deserve more attention.Let me make it clear. TLK is among the most beautifully animated Disney movies. The stampede scene is just huge and intimidating, the intro scene is by far the most iconic scene from any Disney movie along with one of the most iconic and grandest songs ever to be in a movie. The backgrounds are amazing, the whole animation aspect of it is amazing. On that spot it is an undoubted masterpiece.And I must admit that the culmination of the stampede scene with Simba, Mufasa and Scar will for ever be the most emotionally charged scene in a Disney movie if not in a movie in general.The voice acting is good. James Earl Jones is never a disappointment with his booming voice. Jeremy Irons does make a great, slimy, backstabbing, power hungry villain, but falls a little flat when he comes to power compared to both earlier power hungry villains like Maleficent and Jafar and my personal favorite Frollo. But that's a nit-pick, because story-wise it's essential, because we see how young Simba dreams of being a king who can do whatever he wants and that is what Scar turns into when he comes to power."The Circle of Life" which as mentioned before is perhaps the grandest Disney song ever and one of the most iconic openings of any movie. Not just in Disney, but in general. The rest of the music is catchy and memorable and serves the story well. I am not as fond of "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" as I am of earlier love songs like "Beauty and the Beast" and "A Whole New World" simply because the love aspect is kind of disturbing since lions live in prides which consist of family, so therefore making Simba and Nala relatives. "Be Prepared" has a great visual appeal and serves the scene well, but when I listen to it on its own it comes off as just another "I-want-power-because-I'm-evil" song. The african inspiration in the music is amazing, nothing more to say.I must admit that I'm not a big fan of Timon and Pumbaa, but I don't hate them, not at all. They raised Simba, but the fact that they had a tv-show and a direct-to-video film, the latter which I think is garbage, just made me think badly of them.It is my personal opinion. I feel at times TLK is a little overrated, but it is undoubtedly a great movie.

mid-90's. I missed it then, but saw it recently because of my 3 yr old son. I've also seen other animated-family comedies like Shrek, Finding Nemo and Ice Age in recent weeks. Given the leaps in digital technology achieved in the past decade, The Lion King looks very dated. The animation and colors are not as realistic and vivid as 21st century Pixar-Disney offerings.This is basically a child-friendly take on the Hamlet tale with Denmark replaced by the African jungle and people replaced by lions, and other animals, notably a parrot, hyenas etc. The Elton John soundtrack is still quite good, with The Morning Report and Hakuna Matata standing out. The dialogue is not nearly as witty as that of Ice Age or Nemo but still appealing for kids. We have James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons voices for two vital characters, and both have magnificent voices for animated movies. Irons even sings a song or two and has a pretty pleasant voice.

Considering it a better movie than the Wild. Anyways, let's talk about the movie. In the Pride Lands of Africa, a lion rules over the animals as king. The birth of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi's son Simba creates envy and resentment in Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, who knows his nephew now replaces him as heir to the throne. After Simba has grown into a young cub, Mufasa gives him a tour of the Pride Lands, teaching him the responsibilities of being a king and the Circle of Life. Later that day, Scar tricks Simba and his best friend Nala into exploring a forbidden elephant graveyard, despite the protests of Mufasa's hornbill majordomo Zazu. At the graveyard, three spotted hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai and Ed attack the cubs before Mufasa, alerted by Zazu, rescues them and forgives Simba for his actions. That night, the hyenas, who are allied with Scar, plot with him to kill Mufasa and Simba. The next day Scar lures Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there while he gets Mufasa. On Scar's orders, the hyenas stampede a large herd of wildebeest into the gorge. Mufasa rescues Simba, but as Mufasa tries to climb up the gorge's walls, Scar throws him back into the stampede, where he is trampled to death. After Simba finds Mufasa's body, Scar convinces him he was responsible for his father's death and advises Simba to flee the kingdom. As Simba leaves, Scar orders Shenzi, Banzai and Ed to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. That night, Scar announces to the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing a pack of hyenas to live in the Pride Lands. After running far away, Simba collapses from exhaustion in a desert. Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and a warthog, find him and nurse him back to health. Simba subsequently grows up with them in the jungle, living a carefree life with his friends under the motto "hakuna matata" ("no worries" in Swahili). When he is a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reconcile and fall in love. Nala urges Simba to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a wasteland with not enough food and water. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off, leaving Nala disappointed and angry. As Simba exits the jungle, he encounters Mufasa's mandrill friend and adviser, Rafiki. Rafiki tells Simba that Mufasa is "alive" and takes him to a pond. There Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as the king of the Pride Lands. Simba realizes he can no longer run from his past and goes home. Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa join him, and agree to help him fight. At the Pride Lands, Simba sees Scar hit Sarabi and confronts him, but Scar taunts Simba over his "part" in Mufasa's death. However, when Scar pushes Simba to the edge of Pride Rock, he reveals that he killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba roars back up and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs Simba for mercy, insisting that he is family and placing the blame on the hyenas. Simba no longer believes Scar, but spares his life on the grounds of forever leaving the Pride Lands. Scar appears to comply, but then attacks his nephew. After a fierce fight, Simba throws his uncle off Pride Rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and eaten alive by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba ascends to the top of Pride Rock and takes over the kingdom as the rain falls again. Sometime later, with Pride Rock restored to its former glory, Simba looks down happily at his kingdom with Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa by his side; Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the inhabitants of the Pride Lands, and the Circle of Life continues.

                                     This was my favourite movie for the longest time. The music, the animation, the voice actors, they all did a great job. But looking at it again there are somethings that don't work, such as why did Scar reign cause a drought? But anyway I still found many things that I still enjoyed. The comedy for me works very well, I laugh so hard whenever I see this movie. The songs, although all very catching, listening to them again I found some were annoying and were just alright. But I found that the orchestral score greatly outshines the singing ones. The voice actors, especially James Earl Jones, do a great job and I see them fit into their roles perfectly. The movie also gets some of its story from one of Shakespeare's greatest works, Hamlet. And finally, the animation is spectacular. Every bit looks grand and big. The style looks great. The scenes go from colourful and cheery to dark and violent. The climax, almost similar in power to Bambi, is one of the best in Disney's history, mixing powerful emotions and visuals. All in all, I must say it's still one of my favourite of Disney movies.

There's so much I can say about this movie but all my comments always come down to one thing: this movie is beautiful. Pure genius. A timeless story. I might be a little biased in my beliefs, seeing as the first movie I remember seeing in theatres is "The Lion King" and I still watch it on a regular basis and know all the words but I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who agree with what I have to say. "The Lion King" is beautiful; hands down, it is the best Disney film ever created.The story is something that everyone can relate to, whether they are a lion ;) or not. Simba is destined to become king one day and just can't wait to rule the throne; everyone can relate to wanting to grow up and become an adult, to do whatever they want and not have to worry about anything. His father tries to teach him that, despite the fact that he will one day be grown and king, his life will not be easy. Simba has to learn his lesson the hard way when his Uncle Scar, who, too, wants the throne, kills his father and convinces Simba that it was his fault. Suddenly, growing up doesn't seem so great anymore (I can *really* relate to that).And so, Simba flees his home and comes across Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts. They teach Simba the "Hakuna Matata" lifestyle, something that idealizes a life free of stress, worry and responsibility. Now, don't we all wish we could live this way? No worries for the rest of our days... But when Simba's childhood friend Nala returns, he realizes that he can't live Hakuna Matata forever, for he does have a responsibility to his pride and his homeland. Simba understands that he must grow up, as we all do, and does what's right.The songs are catchy and fit the movie well (the original songs, of course, though "The Morning Report" isn't too bad) and the score is haunting and beautiful. Along with the art work, the music captures the heart of Africa.With the types of shows that children watch these days (boy, doesn't that make me sound old?), it's a wonder they'll learn in virtues and values at all. "The Lion King" is a great teacher when it comes to learning lessons that will carry throughout their lifetime. "The Lion King" teaches children that it's all right to be a kid but you must understand and accept responsibility for things you can and cannot control. Everyone has a place in The Circle of Life and we must find it; the film also teaches that we will encounter bad and even terrible things during our lifetime but we must accept them and move on. These are important, meaningful lessons; heck, I even used them in my SAT essay! "The Lion King" is a film for every generation and is a powerful film that all children should see. I'm past my childhood now and I still watch it whenever I get the chance; I look forward to sharing it with my children.A timeless film!

I'd watched this, I liked it, but I preferred many other Disney films. Re- watching this film cheered me up when I was sad right then and there! For those of you who don't know, this is the story of a lion cub called Simba who's future king. He lives on Pride Rock with his loving parents and his friend Nala, a girl lion cub. When he goes into a place he was told not to go, it is only the start of a mesmerising and exciting adventure...I love this film for the five main reasons. Reason 1: I like all the characters in this except Scar, the main baddie. He annoys me just slightly (although I like his voice). Reason 2: The scenery portrays a beautiful vision of Africa and it makes me feel like I'm really there. Reason 3: The plot is very beautiful and it has made me want to read "Hamlet" on which the plot was based! Reason 4: This film has beautiful songs! My favourite is "Can You Feel The Love Tonight?" (written by Elton John) but I love all the others as well. Reason 5: I love the voices that were picked for all the characters. I especially like the sound of Jeremy Iron's (Scar), Rowan Atkinson's (Zazu), Nathan Lane's (Timon), Whoopi Goldberg's (Shenzi), James Earl Jones's (Mufasa) and Moira Kelly's (adult Nala) voices!WARNING! For those of you who are upset by goodies dying in films, then I suggest you use the fast forward button on your remote control when Mufasa leaps up on a rock ledge in the stampede until you see Scar walking towards Simba and Mufasa.Otherwise, enjoy one of my favourite classic Disneys! :) ;) :()

of the greatest animated movies of all time - if not the greatest, 'The Lion King (1994)' is a feast for the eyes on multiple occasions but is, for me at least, far from the best in its genre and is actually a rather average affair due to an 'epic'-seeming (though Shakespeare-'stolen') but poorly-paced plot and a lack of emotional investment, aside from in the film's most famous of moments, which tap into a mostly universal connection - and fear - and don't rely on any actual developed characters. The songs, too, are often out-of-place and serve to tell instead of show, or do a combination of the two, and they tend to point out the flaws in the narrative more than gloss over them, though most are enjoyable to listen to in-the-moment and all are well-produced. It really is the lack of a real connection, however, perpetuated by a poor through-line and pace, that makes this one fall short of the pedestal upon which it has been placed. It didn't connect with me and I found a large portion of the piece quite dull, making for a passive affair that didn't live up to the hype or even keep me wholly engaged for its duration. 5/10

"family" animated full-length movie and felt so unsatisfied, finishing the viewing with a frown on my face. This didn't happen the first time; just on the second and third looks. The film just got worse the more I watched it.Maybe I got more culturally aware. I saw how much New Age baloney was thrown into this film, with Elton John singing about the "circle of life," and a bunch of other more subtle Left wing propaganda that is typical of the Disney company.The villain, and even the little hero, became more annoying in multiple viewings. Once again, the more I watched this, the more unappealing both the characters and the story became, not just the "theology." Nothing in the story is boring, however. The characters are interesting, from the lions to the hyenas to the warthog and his buddy (who provide most of the comedy in here.) The graphics are top-notch with some of the animation - especially in the beginning - just gorgeous.

to my childhood. I can still remember being 3 years old and getting to the cinema late, and cheering out loud at the end, yeah it would seem that now at the age of 16 turning 17 i'd have seen films a lot more closer to home and i have, but as a young child i was very observant of characters even though they were cartoons. Even though I was only three i never forget the film, I never cried at the sad points of the film and no i never really fully understood it until i watch it a few years later but i always remembered Simba's realisation that his life would never be the same. If you haven't seen the lion king *slap in the face* believe me you are missing what i describe as the last Disney film old Walt would be proud of. 10/10

                                                    I loved this movie as a kid. I watched it plenty of times, and enjoyed it every single one of those. Now, over time, a lot of entertainment aimed at kids loses some of it's value. In many cases, it can ruin the experience if you go back and re-watch it as an adult.The Lion King is not like those. The Lion King is just as good as when I was a kid, and that's not just with nostalgia glasses on. Sure, the story's been done before, and it does share some striking similarities to a much older anime, but it still holds my attention and provides great character moments. This movie, if released for the first time today as is, would likely still be one of the best movies of all time.

kid and fairly enjoying it but was surprised to know how much praise it got when I grew up. Even on this rewatch it is pretty good and entertaining. But besides the circle of life concept everything else is quite regressive themes. Add the fact that they never gave credit to Kimba, I think my rating is much higher than it should be.

                    This is the most incredible movie I have ever seen. Sounds silly? It may, considering it is an animated film which a majority of people don't take seriously when in the subject of the greatest movies anyone has ever seen. I personally love animated anything, whether it be cartoons, movies, shorts, etc. The Lion King *IS* the king of all Disney films. We all know the tragic tale of the death of Simba's father, even if we had not seen the movie, thus recognition and praise this movie receives absolutely deserves it no less. This is my favourite movie. The art is simply fantastic. The animation is just breathtaking. The story -- though based off of 'Hamlet' -- is beautiful and will leave you in tears. The voice actors and actresses did an impeccable job for each of the characters' personalities. I especially adore the music. The Lion King had introduced me to African music and I have loved it ever since. The songs in the movie such as "Can You Feel The Love Tonight" (one sung by Elton John, and one sung by Kristle Edwards along with the voices of adult Simba and Nala, both pieces of which I love and listen to everyday) and "Hakuna Matata" are divine and catchy, not to mention adorable. I cannot say how much I love this film. I'm in love with it. The producers and directors and every person who had contributed to the making of it did a marvelous job. Overall, this movie is PERFECT. I've watched it a hundred times already and I'll watch it a hundred more without feeling the slightest bit sick of it.

                                                   This is probably my favorite Disney animation! It has everything: a great story, beautiful animation, memorable songs, humor and of course very good and memorable characters. Perfect for kids and very enjoyable for adults! I wonder how many cats were named Simba during the 90's? :D

film that I don't think will ever be beaten. At least not by anything they're squirting out nowadays.And while thinking about what sets it apart and elevates it to that level when compared to the other Disney films I've talked about recently, I came to the conclusion that it's because none of the protagonists in those films have a real arc. Seriously, think about it. Snow White is always a nice, helpful person, Peter Pan is always heroic (and if you want to tell me Wendy is actually the main character then she always believes in Peter Pan), Mowgli is adamant he's staying in the jungle right until the end of the film, and Ariel is always fascinated by the human world, and gets to live in it happily ever after by the end.But something that I feel isn't typically recognised about this one is that Simba is a spoiled little unlikable brat right up until *that* moment, and only then does the titular "lion king" start to come out of him.But at the same time, he doesn't make the first act of the film unbearable, because the other characters are so memorable and charismatic, the cast is one of the best ever assembled for an animated film, the animation is absolutely stunning and that m u s i c. I don't mean just the songs, although they're all great too, I mean the score by Hans Zimmer is easily one of, if not his absolute best.And the whole thing just feels so much more mature and epic than anything else I've seen from Disney, I mean there's even a little bit of symbolism sometimes, that most kids' films just won't bother with.And it's so much better directed than any of those other films I mentioned to boot, so yeah. As far as I'm concerned, this is peak Disney, and you can absolutely yeet the remake off of Pride Rock.

amassed more than $100 million in just a few weeks. The songs by Tim Rice and Elton John may not be up to those penned by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken for Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin, but otherwise this Lion is a charmer. Marvelous animation, and what a cast! James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Guillaume, Jeremy Irons, Madge Sinclair, Rowan Atkinson, Nathan Lane and Cheech Marin. Well, their voices, anyway.\nYes, there is a little bit of Hamlet in the plot, as Mufasa, the lion king, is done in by his ambitious, scheming, brother Scar, who wants to sit on the throne. Scar and his hyena followers then go after Mufasa's rightful successor and son, the cuddly lion cub Simba. Thankfully, Scar doesn't marry Simba's mother, and the cub's childhood sweetheart, Nala, doesn't go bonkers and jump in the river. This is Disney, after all, so you can rest assured that the tragedy will eventually find its way to a silver lining and a happy ending. There are lots of laughs along the way with the cheeky meerkat Timon (Lane) providing more than his share. He and a worm-eating warthog named Pumbaa get to sing an infectious ditty called "Hakuna Matata," which is translated as, "Don't worry, be happy." Parents shouldn't be surprised if they are called upon to see it more than once. No problem. Hakuna matata.

Firstly, it's a complete rip-off of Kimba the White Lion. Secondly, on it's own it's still terrible. Scar is the most predictable and stereotypical villain ever - Selfish, dark looking, have scars, betrays and backstabs everyone, wants power. You could not make any more generic villain. Simba is so spoiled, he disobeys rules which have obvious consiquences, he do not have any responsibility all he cares about fun, until at the end of the film he takes the leadership. There are tons of songs in this film which makes it incredibly annoying and kills pacing. The story is very simple and weak. The only good thing about this film is humor. I suspect that anyone who claims this is the best animated film, has only seen Disney movies.

the makings of a classic. Great animation, excellent music, likable characters, and a great story. These are the type of movies I grew up with. I watched this film with my little sister a few days ago and it gave me goosebumps. This was Disney at its finest.It's sad however, for it seems that Disney's time has passed. Chicken Little, Home on the Ranch, Meet the Rbinsons, Bolt? These aren't necessarily bad films, but they are hardly on par with this film. The Lion King will be one of those classics that will stand the test of time.

                                                       If this came out when I was a kid it would have been my favorite Disney film. My generation had "Lady and the Tramp" (1955) and "101 Dalmations" (1961). Me, I was always fascinated by wild animals and when it comes to lions, the idea that they were the 'King of Beasts' was icing on the cake. That's why I never missed a Tarzan or Jungle Jim flick when they came on TV back in the day.Well I'm not a kid anymore, so I guess there's no reason to qualify it. This can still be my favorite Disney movie. There are some good lessons here for youngsters, the whole circle of life business and the idea that being brave doesn't mean you have to go looking for trouble. Animation wise it resembles a lot of the older Disney pictures, only natural since it was the last of their hand drawn features. There's a simplicity to the style that's missing from the high tech wizardry of present day animated films. I don't think that means there's a better or worse here, times and technology change so why not movies.Cool comical characters like Timon and Pumbaa, and regal heroes like Mufasa and the adult Simba make this a fun picture. I especially liked the scene where Simba as a cub stepped in his father's footprint making him realize he had big paws to fill someday. The conflict with Scar and the hyenas was positioned well to help Simba understand that early failure is not indicative of future success. Colorful, quick paced and energetic, "The Lion King" is a delightful film experience.

King is not only my favorite Disney movie, it's my favorite movie PERIOD. The film was a major box office success and won several academy awards, including "Best Original Song". And for darn good reason. I have loved The Lion King from the moment I first watched it as a kid. The good stuff in this film is really good. Oh, man, where do I begin? First of all, the story. I like how this movie isn't based on a book or fairy tale. I also love how this film manages to accomplish a pretty solid story when there are no people in this movie, just animals. Now that I mentioned that, I should say that the characters are memorable. Simba is fun to watch, particularly as a kid. Mufasa is also a very like able character. The hyenas are funny and Timon and Pumbaa make great comic relief. Scar was also a very well-done villain. The voice-acting here is terrific. All the actors play who they are supposed to be perfectly. I also loved the animation in this movie. This is the best-looking hand-drawn animated film. It looks best in scenes like the opening scene, the stampede, and the battle between Simba and Scar. I also LOVED the songs. Every one is great to listen to, and my favorite is "I Just Can't Wait To Be King". I don't know what more to say. I adore it. I've seen it a million times and plan on watching it a million times more.

predictable movie, but has its moments. Pretty standard plot, which, but for a few minor detours, can be foreseen from start to finish. Some of the detours are quite interesting though.The humour is mostly quite child-orientated and lame, but there are a few good lines.While most stuff is dumbed-down for kids, there are some decent edgier scenes. Most of Scar's scenes were worth watching. Basically the story was so syrupy-sweet, you got to support the bad guy (even the plot is so predictable you know it won't end well for him).Making it a semi-musical didn't help either. I dislike musicals intensely (though there are a few exceptions): all the music serves is to pad out the movie.Star-studded cast for the voices: Matthew Broderick, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin. Pick of the bunch was Jeremy Irons as Scar - suitably evil voice, with gravitas.A kid's movie, and nothing more.

               The first Disney animated film with no human characters and to be based on an original story is an overwhelming success not only in the box office but as a movie. A lion cub, Simba, is next in line to be Lion King, until his evil uncle Scar, (voiced superbly villanously by Jeremy Irons) plots a coup agains the future king. Along the way we see Simba growing up and discovering the not so perfect world. A great story with a detailed plot that will have you engrossed. The songs are perfectly done, with Elton John singing the themes "can you feel the love tonight?" and "Circle of life".A classic that rivals any of Disney's older masterpieces. Followed by a good but less effective sequel. On a scale of one to ten..8

However, it is not everyday that you get a film that is original and inspirational. The Lion King is a perfect example of that for it's a masterpiece that I guarantee will entertain people of all ages! The plot is pretty straightforward, but I think it has creativity in every way. It follows Simba, a young lion cub who is destined to become the new king of the African Savannah, after his father, Mufasa. However, Mufasa's jealous brother, Scar wishes to claim the throne for himself and intends to kill both Mufasa and Simba, with the help of a dastardly yet comical pack of hyenas. Going into self-exile when told that he is responsible for his father's death by a planned wildebeest stampede (we all know who really did it, don't we?), Simba grows up while befriending the famous duo, Timon and Pumbaa, then is eventually persuaded to defeat his uncle Scar and become the rightful king. A plot such as this is so compelling, it is uncanny. As for the characters, each and every one of them is brilliantly made, and the voice actors are well chosen, my personal favourites being James Earl Jones as the voice of Mufasa, Whoopi Goldberg (well known for her role in Sister Act) as the lead hyena Shenzi and the fabulous Rowan Atkinson as Zazu, a hornbill and the king's majordomo. And let's not forget Nathan Lane as Timon and Jeremy Irons as Scar! The rest of the film is equally fantastic. The main reason I love TLK is that its characters are animals, in the African Savannah (I am a big fan of African wildlife)! For those who have not seen The Lion King, watch it! Now! I promise you will praise the film for all it's worth (made even better with its unique and epic soundtrack) and you will not regret watching it. As a conclusion, I give The Lion King a 10 and recommend it highly.

Maybe, why Disney has sold the soul of the animation art to CGI.This film will remain in history as one of the biggest successes of animation, why? You just have to watch the movie and you'll agree.As many late 80' and 90' Disney films the Lion King is composed as a theatrical musical. It's full of great music, that fits perfectly with both relaxed and heart-breaking moments in the film; Hanz Zammer, Tim Rice and Elton John did a very good work here.Voice cast is just wonderful, specially Scar, voiced by Jeremy Irons, is just one of the finest performing I have ever heard.Animation, flawless, beautiful, one of the best of history. A true example of traditional animation.Story is thought to be suitable for both child and adults. There are tons of cultural references; including associations, movie references, famous quotes, and very complex characters. I have done myself a very large analysis on the Lion King and I was surprised about how many things you can extract from a "Kids movie". Also there are many funny moments kids will enjoy and two memorable gags.As contras, I've nearly nothing about the film itself. Maybe the Kimba controversy... Disney should have admitted the influence; and the complete absence of important female roles that Disney is so used to. I've also note that the way "bad" characters are colored, some signs, are somewhat offensive as they are very stereotypical.My advice, this movie is a MUST for anyone. I have watch it over 10 times already and I'm not getting tired of it. You won't regret it!

I watched it again today after not watching it since I was a child, maybe a little over ten years ago. I really cannot believe the big fuss and when I read reviews on here to see what everyone loved about it I couldn't really find anything and to be honest it just seemed that everyone was stating the obvious 'the songs,' which were the only terrific thing about the entire film, and the fact that they 'loved it as a child,' but children love what everyone else loves, can you really point out something that can really be admired? Do people not consider the incoherence of the plot? I have seen many reviewers see the film as I do, and they tend to point out the things that people don't seem to realise, such as the extremely annoying characters and the fact that the characters are almost... scrambled-like throughout. It's hardly a story. And I know you could say well maybe I liked it as a child because it is a child's film but as many people have stated it is not - because of the violence and depression. What irritated me most is how the film makes you feel sad at the death of Simba's father, yet Simba himself just runs away and almost immediately seems to feel indifferent towards the situation! He just DOESN'T care! He starts singing hakuna matata for goodness sake!!I struggle to see why this film is so loved.



not as much as when I watched Toy Story or Beauty and the Beast. As a kid, I think it was too serious and while it was not boring it wasn't thrilling.(Roger Ebert made note of this on his TV show.) I watched it at age 9 shortly after my father passed away. "Long live the king." Ouch. I avoided it until 10th grade after purchasing one at a Goodwill.\n While I don't own a copy now, on VHS or DVD I have seen it about-I kid you not-8 times in a span of about a year or so! Partly that's because I was in a phase of consistently watching kid movies. Another, and the main one I prefer to dwell on, is that it has a deeper impact now than ever. The movie opens up with the best opening to a movie ever-the song "Circle of Life." This song has a lot of meaning on how every life has purpose. And that's pretty much the whole message-and it touches me now than it could have as a kid. What else could I praise about it? All the songs are great. (Well, while it's good, I find Can You Feel The Love Tonight to be the weakest song.) I always think that I would hate animating this movie-there are no humans, just lions, birds, elephants, a warthog, a lemur, hyenas, etc. The fact of that factor being accomplished is a success in itself. (Sorry, that was hard to write grammatically!) The voice talent is effective. Johnathan Taylor Thomas is the Young SImba while Matthew Broderick is the adult. James Earl Jones and Madge Sinclair, the king and queen of Coming To America, are the king and queen here. Rowan Atkinson is Zazu, Whoopi Goldberg is a hyena, Scar is Jeremy Irons, and many more are flying through my head. The Lion King is a favorite Disney movie of many, like my Grandma, my youth Pastor, my cousin(who names it as his favorite movie,period),and also my actress crush(along with Let It Shine.)(It's actually 13th for me right now-but I love a lot of Disney movies.) Anyways, The Lion King is well loved-and that love is well earned.

entertainment loses a lot of luster once the nostalgia- goggles come off, I find my appreciation for this film to grow the older I get. I personally don't believe Disney has yet created a more beautiful film, since it isn't just a detailed rendition of African wildlife, but its such a deliriously colorful and expressively animated film to boot. The story is honest in its portrayal of the corruption that exists in the world, but more importantly, in the hope that good moral judgement can overcome such corruption. The voice cast is pitch- perfect, the soundtrack remains the absolute greatest in animated film history, and the script (while perhaps not wholly original) deftly balances searing emotional truths with charmingly silly antics.

"Bambi" due to the similarities in its central story, "The Lion King" is so much more than a modern retelling of Disney's 1942 film. Ushering in the full blown revamped Disney brand, this Academy Award winning film is also one of the most mature from Disney's high point period. Focusing on the life of young lion cub and future king, Simba, we follow the naive cub as his life is uprooted in a terrible tragedy and forces him to run away, but years later return and fight for his rightful place.Disney assembles one of their greatest voice casts to portray the vast arrays of characters from the African savanna. James Earl Jones brings his distinctly deep voice to the wise king of Pride Rock, Mufasa, while English thespian Jeremy Irons voices his wicked brother, Scar, the film's central villain and most foppish bad guy in the Disney cannon. Child star Johnathan Taylor Thomas voices the young Simba to youthful perfection while Matthew Broderick voices the adult Simba (as I've grown up, Broderick's vocal performance is mismatched for Simba's adulthood when Simba finally grows up and takes responsibility for his past). Comedic talents Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin voice two of Scar's hyena lackeys, Shenzi and Banzai, with a mostly maniacal laughing performance from veteran voice actor, Jim Cummings, as third hyena lackey, Ed. And stealing the film's comedic spotlight are Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as Timon, the meerkat, and Phumba, the warthog. The duo are the characters who taught us all that "Hakuna Matata" means 'no worries' and made us laugh with their constant bickering and hilarious exchanges and actions.Following in Disney's tradition for using live reference models, the animation team traveled to Kenya to sketch the landscape of the savanna. The company also had live animals from lions, meerkats, warthogs and various birds brought into the studio by zookeepers in addition to seeing the wildlife in action in their native habitat. Complimenting the amazing visuals is the Oscar winning score by Hans Zimmer and Oscar winning songwriting team of Elton John and Tim Rice. Zimmer's instrumental score paints the dramatic picture in musical tones, but does express joy at the film's happiest moments, while Sir Elton and Tim Rice add the dramatic and comedic lyrics to compliment Zimmer's lush orchestral score.

The casting is great and the score is exceptional. I was enjoying it from the start and the next thing I know the movie ended, never a dull moment.

Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more. The message is very positive. There is a little bit of Hamlet in the plot. Previous films were routine love stories where boy and girl meet, know each other, fall in love and stay together in the very end. This film is much more than that. Simba is a young prince and his father is the King, who is respected and loved by all. The prince is next in line to the throne. He is innocent and naive and eagerly wants to grow up and take his place as King. Scar, king's evil extremely jealous brother, wants to be King himself, and he is ready to go to any means to get what he wants. Simba, along with his best friend Nala, is having a happy childhood - until one fateful day, where his father is cruelly killed by Scar, right in front of Simba's own eyes, hurting him for life. When Scar tricks Simba into believing that he killed his own beloved dad, Simba runs away, far away, never to return. He meets Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him some important lessons: Life is worth living. And Hakuna Matata - no worries. Simba grows from a small cub with a painful past, into a handsome and mature young lion. When Simba and Nala meet again after all these years, he falls in love with her and Simba's life takes a dramatic turn. It is a truly great combination of drama, comedy, romance, life lessons, and musical songs in a Disney movie.

They told me it was the best Disney movie ever. I had seen almost all the Princess films. I have also seen a few other Disney films. Ever since then, I have seen so many classics.It's hard to explain. On one hand, this film was VERY well done. Good characters, good plot, good story, good effects, good music, no cheesy everyone-goes-into-the-middle-of-the-street-to-dance sequences, etc.On the other hand... I don't know. It seemed to lack something. To be honest, most movies no matter how awesome they are, lack something. I guess near the end when the evil lion was about to be eaten, having the good lion save him even though he did all those bad things, would have been interesting to see. However, it went quite well.But in this case, I'll have to rate it 9/10 because it's a classic! :)

again recently. Though the story is just an odd family drama where the less capable brother overthrows the king by deceit while his son runs away; only to return years later to undo the injustice and regain his throne. Where “Lion King” excels is getting this story out of animated animals and put in a way that kids would love.Pride Rock in Africa is where the earth is green and animals live in peace in the reign of the great lion Mufasa (James Earl Jones) who is assisted by an old wise monkey Rafiki and a loyal bird Zazu (Rowan Atkinson). Plotting with the hyenas, Scar (Jeremy Irons) causes a wildebeest stampede and kills Mufasa while Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas/ Matthew Broderick) takes the blame for putting his father in fatality’s way.Consequently, Simba runs away to a distant land where he grows up in the company of Timon, a meerkat and Pumba a warthog, characters so lively that their “Hakuna Matata”, the no-worry song is one of its biggest hits with its infectious positivity. In a chance encounter with his former playmate and destined lover Nala reminds him of his unfinished business at home. Wiser now, Simba returns to claim his due!Made in times that can nostalgically be remembered as the days when animation still had the old artistic beauty with just the right mix of CGI. “Beauty and the Beast” and “Anastasia” too come from a similar time and won accolades for their Music. Though its sequels or games weren’t too appealing, the original is still a masterpiece. You can’t just miss those adorable characters, each filled with life and character! No description of “Lion King” can be complete without a befitting praise to its songs. While Hans Zimmer won the Oscar for the best score, Elton John’s Can You Feel the Love Tonight in the credits is its best song. The judicious mix of African vocals in “Circle of Life” the deep darkness of “Be Prepared” and childish fun of “Can’t wait to be king” keep ringing much after the movie is over and even after years pass by! With its short runtime of just over an hour, it doesn’t take away much of your time but doesn’t at all fail to take you into itself. Neatly edited, there is never a time that you get bored with it. Though technology has moved light years after Lion King, I’d still say that if you have missed watching it back then, better run and grab the DVD!

animation. The character animation of this is so fluid and the colours just leap. But my lord, the backgrounds are masterpieces. This film is pretty much a paintng come to life. I do like the story, but Timon and Pumba are the stars of the film. They are just so funny. The film is as amazing now being an adult, but it still is amazing.

The soundtrack is perfect, the dialogue is excellent, and the voice performances by the actors are top notch. As an adult, I appreciate the humor that I missed as a kid and that is what sets this film apart; it can be watched by audiences of all ages. James Earl Jones was most fitting as Mufasa, as were the rest of the actors in their roles. A true epic.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               First of all, the music in this film is just so iconic and no matter what generation you are a part of you have heard these songs more than once. It's not just the songs that I'm talking about the score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is spectacular. The score fits so well with every scene and it helps to intensify the scene. The entire movie is just filled with incredible music. The animation in this film is stunning and, in my opinion, looks better than some of the animated movies we have now a day. The animals have amazing detail on them and you can easily tell that the animators put a lot of effort into making each and every detail. Not just with the animals but the background as well. This is best shown in the "I Just can't Wait to be King" song where the animators took the time to change up the backgrounds to help convey that this is a dream sequence. I know it's weird to mention cinematography in an animated film but honestly, this film almost feels like a live-action film and I will do whatever I want because the cinematography is outstanding in this film. From shots where they are showing a bright scene and then quickly changing to dark is just amazing. The characters in this film feel three-dimensional and anybody can easily relate to one or more of the characters. From the people who are free and easy-going like Timon and Pumbaa to the protective parent like Mufasa they all are relatable and had great voice casting. Everybody was perfectly voice casted and I could easily see them as that character. I only really had a problem sometimes with Matthew Broderick where a couple of times I couldn't really hear it. This film has a great message in it that you shouldn't run away from your problems but deal with them right then and there in the present. In the end, this film is perfect for anybody and everybody.

Oh how I love this film!! This is such a classic Disney film! The reason this film is a classic is because of how big it is and how beautiful the animation is and the characters, the characters, the characters!!! These are some of the most likable and unique characters that I have ever seen in a movie ever. Simba is such a sweet character and from the get-go you wanna explore the jungle with him and you want to sing I Just Can't Wait To Be King with him as well!! Timon and Pumbaa are so sweet and funny and you can tell that they really care about Simba. Mufasa and Scar are such amazing characters and aah I just love this movie so much. This movie will always be a classic to me and I will always wanna watch it again and again.

King 10/10Lion King is a popular choice of being on people's favorite Disney movie list. There is really not any flaws in this type of film. It has a good story and not looking for cheap jokes that i find in CGI animal films. The music is amazing and really helps tell the story. The emotions you feel watching this film is overwhelming. It is a good feel movie because even though there is betrayal and death in the film life continues.Least favorite parts: Hard to pick anything that I dislike in this film, but I guess Simba having to think it was his fault for his father's death all those years sucked. lolFavorite parts: Music Recommendation: Movie that should be own. A movie to revisit in about lets say at least once in two years.

         "The lion king" is a film that can accompany people to grow up, it brings people moved, the aftertaste is deep and long. The first time I saw it, I cried twice, once mufasa died and simba cried out in despair, and once at the end of the film simba stood on the rock of glory again and everything came back to life. The story is set on the African savannah full of vitality. The magnificent savannah sets off the profound themes of love, responsibility, growth and life cycle into a grand epic, showing a new and magnificent world, and letting us experience the life of love and adventure. This connotation transcends any culture or country, because human beings cannot change the laws of nature, and love is the emotion that human beings always pursue. The reason why this is a film with the growth of people, because from the film we can see their own growth. Like the protagonist simba, childhood carefree, naughty and brave.

                                             Gods I love this movie!The soundtrack is exemplary as is every element of this beautiful Disney masterpiece.The Baboon, affectionately dubbed "Bruce-Monkey" after Bruce Lee, is a scream! Jeremy Irons' voice as Scar is absolutely Shakesperean in its darkling malevolence. James Earl Jones's voice is a perfect Mufassa; it's commanding and brooding, just as it should be, turning playful when the mood arises. The graphics and artistry are some of the best ever produced by Disney, in this Fiend's opinion, and the eclectic spirituality of the movie; the circle of life, the wheel of the year, birth and rebirth, are moving and inspiring.As with all Disney movies, the movie has a message: make responsible choices and be responsible for the choices you make.I highly recommend the 2-disk Special Edition with added footage and an entire disk of extras.It gets a solid 9/10 from...the Fiend :.

ultimately quite moving. It manages to be digestible for kids, but meaty enough for anyone older.Some great voicing -- especially by Jeremy Irons. The songs are good, and most of the animation is quite beautiful. It has its occasional sappy moments, and the basic plot is old as the hills, but its all done very, very well. Not as sophisticated as some of the Pixar films, but I not ashamed to admit it made me it made me laugh and cry - both times I've seen it. How many current Hollywood films, animated or not, can you say that about?

But going back means I'll have to face my past. I've been running from it for so long."Ever since I first saw The Lion King in 1994 it has remained my favorite animated film of all time. I don't think I've revisited another movie as much as I have this one. I loved each one of the characters (Timon being one of my all time favorites), the story, the songs, and the emotional roller-coaster ride it took me through. It's a perfect film in my opinion and I ignore the comments saying that it's emotionally manipulative. It's also one of the most quotable animated movies and the animation of the African savannah is simply breathtaking. The Lion King plays out as a Shakespearean tragedy as it is loosely based on Hamlet, and I have to admit that this film probably influenced my love for Shakespeare. I'm not going to lie, I didn't even know anything about Shakespeare when I first saw this movie, and after reading Hamlet I never even made the connection between these two. My love for The Lion King must have subconsciously influenced my appreciation for Shakespeare because now I'm a huge fan of his work and have read many of his plays.The story is incredibly gripping and there are several scenes that have stuck with me all these years. The very opening sequence is simply impressive as we are introduced to the kingdom and all the animals have gathered around to see the new born prince. Who can forget the first time Scar shows up on screen and Mufasa is there to confront him for not showing up at his son's birth. Scar is a very different villain and one who wouldn't dare face his brother face to face, but he is manipulative and smart. Then there is the frightening scene where Simba and Nala visit the Elephant Cemetery and are chased by the hyenas. And I could continue naming more scenes because the entire story is simply gripping. My favorite moment however is when Simba befriends the unlikely duo of Timon and Pumba, but who can forget the scene where Simba laments his father's death. James Earl Jones was the perfect choice for Mufasa's voice. Everything about this film works, it's a masterpiece. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/

                                                         This movie wasn't just another kid's animation movie, It was much more exciting than the other movie's, The Story Was Excellent, Every Character was noticeable and from my sight they was not boring at all, Not even one of them. They Created Simba very childish And naughty, But they also Add to him Innocent and honest. I think most of us like Timon And Pumba, I especially like Timon (Not only because I love meerkats) He's perpendicular and A show off, But there is something about him that easy to like, He's funny Sometime's He's even sensitive, Now Pumba, Thats one lovely warthog! He's so innocent, They add a lot to The Lion King. I'v seen this movie many time's, And every section that Mufasa died, I cried. The music was brilliant, very noticeable, They(Elton John, Tim Rice) Surely deserve an Oscar.The Best Animation Film. Sincerely, BanditIdan from the Bandit's Guild

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Probably what bugs me about The Lion King is the character design of the lions. Basically, everything I find visually engaging about lions is all but left out of the character design. Beauty & the Beast and Aladdin both had far stronger character designs, as indeed did many previous Disney films centring around animals. It would, however, be foolish of me to fish for any other faults that are simply non-existent.The Lion King is a masterpiece. Good story? Check. A royal lion cub who's a bit on the spoiled side sees his world fall apart when his father dies in a wildebeest stampede. Tricked into thinking he was responsible, he flees and adopts a life of ease with the carefree duo Timon and Pumbaa.This is some epic stuff. Though I decided not to include The Lion King in my favourites list of animated movies, my breath is still taken away when Simbaa sees those wildebeest run down into the canyon. That whole scene is one of the most heartbreaking scenes of cinema I have ever seen. There are real highs and lows here, a quality that most of the old Disney movies sorely lacked (and this coming from a big fan).Another big plus is the music. The soundtrack goes the whole scale. When all is well in Simbaa's life, there is hopeful music echoing of the jungle and the savannah. Then things get darker and the music gets deeper and more epic than anyone who's not heard it can imagine. "Be Prepared" is excellent and rightfully scary as the following scene testifies. The stampede score is one of the most ground-shaking pieces of music I have ever heard. When that all gets too much, there's "Hakuna Matata", the ultimate anthem for carefree living, to soothe the soul. Personally, Elton John's original version of "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" (in the end credits) is the stronger of the two presented; I can hardly fight back tears every time I hear it. "The Circle of Life" set the tone for how movies should start and not for no reason. The whole audio part of this movie is a complete bullseye.The characters themselves, even if I really dislike most of the designs, are mostly very good. Scar is wickedly ambitious. Rafiki shows that wise characters can also be tremendously funny, and it's not for no reason that Timon and Pumbaa got their own show; they are wonderful. Equally great are the three hyenas. Then of course, there's Sazu (wonderfully voiced by Rowan Atkinson), the unfortunate bird who's the butt of the crown, no matter on which side of the family he's standing.With a stunning climax, soaring music and a roaring (sic), engaging story, The Lion King is a movie that hits every mark it needs right. It hits home with the audience and makes them feel for this world. It may not hit the mark with my aesthetic senses, but to pretend that the movie was lesser because of that would be foolish of me. The Lion King is a masterpiece, on par with the Beauty & the Beast.

                                                       Writing about this film brings with it a feeling of nostalgia for times gone by. This was in fact the very FIRST movie that I watched on the big screen; way back in 1994. I can still recall the awe and the wonder I had when I sat in the rows (somewhere in the middle I think) and looked up at screen. Ah, the good old days...Anyway, to cut to the chase, the movie itself is a triumph and one of the best animated movies that I've seen. While the story itself is essentially about the eventual triumph of good over evil, this hackneyed theme does not stop the story from being poignant or touching. In fact, one might say that that it actually serves as the moral for a story that after all was aimed at children. The central character of the movie is Simba, the baby cub of Mufasa, the king of the lion pride. The movie begins with his birth and unfolds as we watch Simba mature from a young cub to a youthful lion (the transition occurring in the wilderness after his evil uncle Scar kills off his father). The movie concludes with Simba regaining his rightful place in the "circle of life" and becoming a father himself (after an epic fight with Scar. The battle was one of the best scenes of the movie. Extremely Powerful.) And as far as the animation goes, everything is top notch. The songs of the movie were hit songs with "Hakuna Matata" becoming a sort of an anthem for a while, I think. All in all, a great movie that should be watched, if only for its songs and some scenes.

One sequence and one sequence alone. But what a sequence it was. They showed the very beginning of the film, where the animals all across the continent are bowing down to the new lion prince and king-to-be, Simba. If you have seen this movie- and if you haven't, I really do feel sorry for you- you know why that is all they needed.Honestly, this is far and away the best animated film Disney has ever produced or will ever produce. Most people of the critical persuasion prefer BatB, but I heartily disagree. Yes, BatB is probably a better movie plotwise and technically. But it's the kind of the film where I sit back and think, 'That was good. So was that. I love that angle. Those leaves are nice.' This is the kind of film that overloads me with grandeur and epicness and raw feats of animation and storytelling.It taps into something deeper, something essential to the human mind and spirit. True, I should expect something of the sort saying that it is clearly based on Shakespeare's Hamlet, but this film takes its material and runs as fast as a gazelle on the African plains. I am often borderline by how attached I am to this film and what it does. It's lush in a way that no Disney film (Frozen comes closest) can live up to.Most films strike me most the first time I see them, even films that I really like. Not this movie. Every time, it blows me away more and more. The more movies I see and the more things I experience, the more impressive this film becomes. It's extraordinary. At the top of the list of the extraordinary things it does is the animation. Comparing Western and Eastern 2-D animation is like comparing a mountain with a river, but I say here and now that this film somehow looks even better than Miyazaki's finest works, and believe me, that is not a compliment I through around lightly. The colors are so rich and the lines so well-defined. There are animated movies out there that want to make you think that you're not watching drawings. This film doesn't. This film proudly displays its art and soars with it.There are too many good scenes in this film to count. I won't spoil them in case you are part of the group of poor unfortunate souls who haven't yet seen the film, but they roll in, one right after the other. The climax in particular sticks out to me. It's probably one of the most atmospheric scenes in all of cinema.Some people throw around the word 'epic' lightly. I do not. I only say something is epic if it has the qualities of an epic. This does, which is impressive considering it is less than an hour and a half long. I wouldn't say it's quite as sprawling as LoTR or Princess Mononoke, but the way it manages do evoke the same feelings as those films in such a short running time is most impressive.The characters are not the best part of the film, but they are not particularly annoying either. Simba is fine, though I like him considerably more as a child than an adult. Nala is sympathetic and grounded and one of my favorite characters in the film. I used to hate Zazu when I first watched this movie as a kid, but I can identify with him more and more as I grow up. Serabi isn't particularly dynamic, but she is likable enough. Timon and Pumbaa annoy me, but they don't make the film any worse, and any damage they do is undone by Mufasa. Played by James Earl Jones, he is one of the coolest, most captivating movie characters ever. When he says something, you listen. I think the role would have still been good without Jones, but with him, it is legendary.Like most all 90's Disney movies, this is a musical, and a musical is nothing without great songs. I have forgiven a lot of subpar musicals because they had good songs, and I have bashed a lot of otherwise fine musicals for an excess of poor song numbers. The songs here are fantastic. The Circle of Life would be my choice if I had to pick a new Disney song to replace When You Wish Upon a Star. It is anthemic. I Just Can't Wait to be King is one of my all time guilty pleasures. Whenever I'm feeling down in the dumps, I cue it up, and within five minutes I'm dancing to jungle drums. But my all time favorite is Can You Feel the Love Tonight? This was originally intended to be a joke duet sung by Timon and Pumbaa, but Elton John made them change it, and I thank him for it. Not only did this song win at the Oscars (three Lion King songs were nominated that year, forcing them to change the rules so only one song per movie is eligible), Elton John's version of it won Best Male Performance at the Grammy's. It won award after award and rightfully so. It is the most sweepingly romantic song I've ever heard. Listen to the Elton John version though. It's better than the one in the movie.This isn't just a generational touchstone or an all-time classic. It's one of the best movies of all time and a sterling showcase for the power of animation.

Today it made a dear friend of mine's day better. So, if this movie wasn't made, my friend would be having a sad day, but thanks to the people who made this movie happen, my friend is all good now, and I love anyone who makes my baby girl's day better. When a movie manages to cheer up a person more than 10 years after it was made, then it proves to everyone that it was one successful movie. If you're having a sad day, maybe you should watch this movie. If a friend is having a sad day, maybe you should suggest this movie to them.

While the first half of the feature was well- executed, the second half somewhat felt too rushed/convenient - which kinda made it less satisfying. That being said, the songs are as always energetic and colourful. The characters are likable, Timon & Pumbaa were amusing, but all the credit goes to Scar especially, he stole the show, both as an entertainer and as a complex villain. Final verdict: It is good but it does suffer from some flaws, but for some reason people keep praising it as if it was a masterpiece. In short, I think it's overrated.

                                  1994 saw the release of some of the best movies and Disney brought us what is consider a masterpiece of the 1990s The Lion King was release in theaters in 1994 I remember my family and I went and saw The Lion King in theaters it was one of the best movies I have seen in the theaters in the 90s and in general.This is the 5th film in the Disney Renaissance.Everything about this movie is just terrific it's just hard to find anything that holds The Lion King back from being known as one of the greatest movies to ever be created.The story is really powerful and gives many lessons through the motion picture the writers really deliver that's for sure. Of course can't have a story without talking about the animation to this day is just one of the most perfectly, well drawn, and bright animation films ever created. Every scene is like watching a masterpiece comes to life, the animators study the animals and learn their behavior. The backgrounds are beautiful as well. It just this film has some of the best animation works ever.Another thing that makes Lion King a success is the music. It just excellent every piece of music written for the film just matches it perfectly.Along with the classic songs "Circle Of Life", "I Just Can't Wait To Be King" "Be Prepared" "Hakuna Matata" "Can You Feel The Love Tonight". These songs help make The Lion King a hit and serve meaning.Also the voice acting is very well done and you can feel the performances from the cast they just gave one of the best in their respective careers. Each actor they cast was just right for the roles.Simba ("YOUNG" Jonathan Taylor Thomas "Adult" Matthew Broderick) Simba is a strong protagonist for the film Mufasa (James Earl Jones) James' voice was perfect for this role and he gave a great performance, Scar (Jeremy Iorn) Scar remains one of my favorite villains and Jeremy's voice really brought the character to attention as he was pure evil. Nala ("Young" Niketa Calame, "Adult" Moira Kelly) Nala is a very good character as well and one of the best in the film, The other characters are Zazu (Rowan Atkinson) Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) and Timon (Nathan Lane) are pretty funny, Rafiki (Robert Guillaume), Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg),Banzi (Cheech Marin) and Ed (Jim Cummings) They each deliver a great performance in the film and you can't help but feel they enjoy the work of the film that's a rare thing.The Lion King is just one of the best I have seen in theaters and one of the best films everI give The Lion King a 10 out of 10

of it... ALL of you people are so afraid from violence in cartoon, and ,,sex'' in cartoon, but let me tell you something, truth is there and you can't hide it from your kids forever, they should better know about violence and should know it is bad, since in every Disney movie good side wins, and I like it that way... As for the sex, don't worry, your children will not learn about sex from cartoon, sex is in their instinct, as soon as they reach five, they will notice the difference, and will do some experiment with their body, and that is natural...so don't say how grossed you are because you noticed sex everywhere, because that is your perverted mind, kids are still too young to notice it everywhere... and I was mad when I read some bad comments that said how it is unbelievable that there is only one male lion , and all others are female, well it is not only BELIEVABLE, but it is TRUTH, there is only one male lion in pack of lions, no more, so you ,,smart'' people could learn something from this cartoon, It would be like watching National Geographic... I Loved this movie when I was kid, and I still love it now... 10/10

One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king."The Lion King was a masterpiece when I was a kid, and it's still a masterpiece, now. It's easily in my personal top ten. It's a movie that every breathing person should see. Other than those things, there are really only three other details you need to know about it. 1. A lot of the better animated movies are known for being enjoyable for both kids and adults, but The Lion King may be the very best example of that description. Children will love the antics of the hyena trio and Timon and Pumbaa, while adults will find the Hamlet-inspired drama to be top-notch.2. The animation is outstanding; from the bright, vivid colors of the characters and scenery of The Pride Lands, to the nightmarish macabre darkness of The Elephant Graveyard. I still don't think that there has been superior traditional animation from the U.S., Japan, or anywhere else. It's dazzling in standard definition, I'm almost drooling at the prospect of the eventual high-def release.  3. If you like the musical aspect of animated movies, you're in luck. While most Disney films have one or two great songs and several good ones, The Lion King is packed with great songs from beginning to end. Nostalgia may be partially to blame, but I can't hear The Circle of Life or Can You Feel the Love Tonight without getting goosebumps.

when Mufasa dies. The Lion King is impossible not to like, with it's stunning animation, the well fitting voice cast, amazing music that will never be forgotten, and universal rating.Simba is a young lion cub, who lives on Pride Rock, and his father is the King, Mufasa, who is respected and loved by all. This makes Simba a prince and next in line to the throne. Simba is innocent and naive and eagerly wants to grow up and take his place as King. Scar, Mufasa's evil and extremely jealous brother, wants to take over Pride Rock and be King himself, and he is ready to go to any means to get what he wants...Simba, along with his best friend Nala, is having a happy childhood - until one fateful day, where his father is cruelly killed by Scar, right in front of Simba's own eyes, hurting him for life. When Scar tricks Simba into believing that he killed his own beloved dad, Simba runs away, far away, never to return. He meets Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog, respectively, who teach him some important lessons: Life is worth living. And Hakuna Matata - no worries. Simba grows from a small cub with a painful past, into a handsome and mature young lion. When Simba and Nala meet again after all these years, Simba's life takes a dramatic turn. But will Simba take his rightful place as King of Pride Rock? Jonathan Taylor Thomas, the voice of young Simba, was very well casted. His voice matches with that of the feisty young cub perfectly. Matthew Broderick, who takes over the part of Simba as an adult, is just as good as his younger counterpart, if not better. I loved the voice of Mufasa, James Earl Jones, his voice is so calming and deep, and sounds wise, perfect for Mufasa, the ageing but immensely respected leader. Jeremy Irons as Scar is so perfectly done, ditto with Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. Timon and Pumbaa's voice overs were done with great finesse and very tastefully, and the voices and characters are very lovable. I thought Nala's older voice, Moira Kelly was miscast. The young girl who played her younger part was much better though.Heartwrenching and loved by many, The Lion King is one that cannot be missed.

                               One of the true classics of Disney that should enter any fan's Top 5 animated movie list. What happens to Simba and his dad is truly messed up and makes the Bambi Mom situation seem like an episode of Full House. Forget the unnecessary and frankly insulting remake: this is the King of Lion King films.

                                                              This is my favorite Disney animated movie of all time. The opening scene with all of the animals and "The Circle of Life" is breathtaking. Right from the start you want to know the story of the adorable baby lion. It has very memorable characters including Simba of course, and Timon and Pumba are hilarious sidekicks. As a child I remember being frightened by the villain, Scar. The music is by far the best part of this movie. After all these years, I can still sing along. "Hakuna Matata," which means no worries, will be a favorite for many. I use "Can you feel the love tonight?" as a lullaby for my baby. I recommend this movie to all families with children 5 and up.

When you are a little kid you just get more scared off the smallest things and when I saw the hyenas chasing Simba in the elephant graveyard I had nightmares for weeks. Granted the Lion king is a pretty violent film for its time and I wouldn't actually recommend you kids watching it at least not without and adult. Now just hear me out, this movie is the reason that I have assembled my love for movies in the first place. It changed everything and guided me into a world off good versus evil and how you always can move away from tragedy in your life and take the path that fate have chosen for you. The Lion King is a movie that will be watched for generations to come and the new remake off the film here in 2019 is not gonna bring the magic back all, I know that because you can't do a movie twice that already have been made so perfectly by Walt Disney himself, its just not gonna happen. I give The Lion king the highest score possible, it truly deserved it.

                                   Taking a Shakesphere approach and pushing it to the limit, The Lion King presents a mature yet authentic story while balancing its characters and funny/ dark moments. You can walk up to anyone on the street and ask ''How did you feel when Scar threw Mufasa off the cliff?'' and they'll tell you they were devastated. With its memorable soundtrack, gorgeous animation and amazing ending, The Lion King is not only the best Disney movie, but is quite possibly, the greatest animated movie of all time!

                                                            Disney, for all practical purposes, invented the animated feature, and for decades pioneered the genre's significant advances like special effects animation, and the multi-plane camera. The studio was riding high in the late 80s and early 90s with top-notch films like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. Toward the end of this new Golden Age of cell animation, Disney released one of their best – The Lion King. The film is a little less humorous than past efforts, but it's law-of-the-jungle theme (and some of the characters) hearkened back to The Jungle Book.Like the Jungle Book, we have a child (this time a lion cub), and a tyrant ruler cat wants him dead. (Jeremy Irons' portrayal of Scar in The Lion King even sounds like George Sanders' portrayal of Shere Khan in The Jungle Book.) He's hidden away in the jungle where he befriends some fun-loving, off-the-wall jungle animals that provide not only comic relief, but some of the best songs of the film, before a climactic battle ends the tyrant's rule by fire. In fact, the parallels to The Jungle Book are so prevalent that one could call it a remake. But no matter, just like that film it's highly enjoyable, and a highpoint for Disney. Unfortunately, just like that film, which marked the end of Disney's first Golden Age, The Lion King was the last gasp of Disney's second Golden Age. After this came a long steady, slow decline into mediocrity beginning with well-worn tales like Pocahontas, Hercules and Tarzan, ultimately leading to such forgettable fare such as Treasure Planet and Home on the Range. A hole from which they might never have re-emerged were it not for the saving grace of Pixar.

                                  "The Lion King" is a very good movie. It's entertaining and funny. It's moving and overall a very satisfying film. But if I went through this review listing everything that's good about "The Lion King" it would be to long. It does have all of the characteristics and a technically fine movie so I will just go over some of the little things that kept me from giving this film a slightly higher rating.The story, while completely technically proficient with all beats hit, felt a little thin to me. The story works fine, but it doesn't really explore the world of "The Lion King" and flesh out the atmosphere as I feel it should. It felt like there were missing scenes now and then.The only other complaint is rather minor. I felt the animation was a little poor at times. While this film is mostly quite beautiful and a joy to behold, at some points the animation just felt limited. Mostly it was because of lack of detail in the environments, and small amount of character environment interaction. However like I said this amounts to be a small complaint.Overall this is just a really good film. 7.9/10

The quality of animation, movement and voices behind the characters all were so good I have this movie in my collection.This movie was the best animated movie for me in 1994, but still is. The creativity in screenplay, dialog, character development, environment, music, etc. all are masterpieces. This movie is outstanding and exceptional for me.

I won't waste much time talking, I just have to say that this is the best animated film I have EVER seen!!From the initial opening right through to the full circle ending, this one has the correct pace and the visual strength to be, in my opinion, the best Disney movie ever!!Everyone needs to see this film, whether your 4 or 80, you need to see this. It's sooooooooo beautiful, and it boasts probably the most villainous baddie ever!!! Scar.Great array of vocal talent, and lovely storyline, this one MUST be seen.perfect 10 for this 'king of the jungle'!!!!!Enjoy!

                     Good lord, I remember it being good but not THIS good. This is by far the most cinematic Disney movie. Every scene is filled with gorgeous animation and direction. The songs are fantastic as well, this might have the best overall song quality of any Disney movie. The movie is perfectly paced and plotted, and I was never bored even for a second. The characters are well written and Simba's struggle to overcome hs traumatic past is incredibly engaging. I love his bond with his dad, and Mufasa's death is probably the saddest scene in all of Animation. Scar is also an amazing antagoist, constantly manipulating Simba into thinking and doing what Scar wants him to. The side characters are fantastic as well. Nala, Rafiki and Timon and Pumba all have a lesson to teach Simba, and they all have very distinct personalities. The climax is well set up, and Scar's death is oddly poetic, as he never respected the Hyenas and get to feel their wrath. This is one of the best Disney movies, it's almost without flaws and I have no problem calling it a true cinematic masterpiece, as I wholeheartedly think it deserves it.

                                   When it comes to Disney it's hard to beat this movie. The remake is complete trash in comparison. The music is great, Hans Zimmer and Elton John can't be beat. The voice cast is perfect and no one can tell me there's a better person for Scar than Jeremy Irons. Skip the new one just watch this one.

It is perfect to all ages. The sound track is absolutely amazing i find myself singing along to all of the songs every time i watch it (nice one Elton). It is one of only two animated films which actually make me cry which i believe is pretty hard for a film to do. Erm it is my childhood film the one that you watch so much the tape began to go weird, it was one of the only films i bought in DVD to replace the tape. It suite's all ages and all sexes. It doesn't matter what kind of films you like you'll love The Lion King. It is ideal for sitting in with a pizza to watch with the family and friends.

Disney convert. I didn't like what I saw of Disney movies as a kid and by the time THE LION KING came out in 1994 I was 13 and couldn't be less interested in kid's films anymore anyway. Decades later, I've finally watched it for the first time and the experience has reaffirmed all of the negativity I associate with Disney animation.This is over-simplistic, spoon-fed pulp for the masses. The story is copied from HAMLET and simplified to get rid of all the complexity. The characters are trite and one-dimensional without anything in the way of depth or motivation. Jeremy Irons' bad guy is that just because. The positive thing about this is that the character animation is very good indeed, although I found the backdrops simplistic in the extreme. The comedy relief is laboured and the songs trite. The whole experience washed over me without touching or involving me once, and don't get me started on the exaggerated voice acting.

opus. All other Disney films since are measured by how they compare to this one, and so far nothing Disney's done has come particularly close. The only other animated films of the last 30 years that deserve a seat at the table with this behemoth are Studio Ghibli's 'Spirited Away' and Pixar's 'Toy Story', with The Lion King still being the best of the three.What puts this film above all others is its engagement factor-there isn't an age group that won't be just as entertained and intrigued by this film as another. It's heart-wrenching, hilarious, romantic, exciting, dramatic and at times even a bit scary. It never hits a lull, and-so far-never gets old. This film is, by every measure, a masterpiece. A true gold standard of cinema.

                                               This is mine personally my favourite Disney movie excluding Pixar for a couple of reasons to start off with I grew up with because most Disney movies if I didn't see as a kid but as an adult I probably wouldn't like them but when you rematch the ones you watched as a kid it's still good if that makes any sense for example I love Beauty and the beast and lion king because I watched them as a child but I never watched Little mermaid or Aladin as a kid(don't get mad at me) but I didn't like them as much because I diddint grow up with themThis also has the best music out of all of them I can name Hakunah Matatah, Be prepared, circle of life, Can you feel the love tonight, and Can't wait to be king off of my head cause they were great and co written by Elton John and that's part of why it was so memerable in short Lion king is great to rewatch older and good to watch with your kids

                                Turn up the word "excellent film" in the wordbook and you'll find "The Lion King", who has earned it's reputation as Disney's most successful animated feature ever. As a child I was fan to the old Disney features like "Bambi", "Jungle Book" and etc, but "Lion King" was the first of the "newest" Disney features who I really got hooked on (except "Rescuers Down Under"). I liked "The Little Mermaid" and "Aladdin", but they weren't my favorites ("Beauty and the Beast" I liked when I was older, since it's a more mature movie). I remember seeing "Lion King" in theaters when I was 10 and it was a life experience. I was totally blown away of the opening and the rest of the film. I got tears of the sad moments and laughed a lot of the funny moments.Afterwards I saw this movie many times on VHS and as a teenager I was taking care of some kids who saw "The Lion King" over and over again as well. So I got really sick of it.But I'm still enjoying it this movie now. "Lion King" has some of the greatest moments in Disney history ever. My favorite characters are Simba, Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa. Scar is a good and unusual villain, although he's never been my favorite Disney villain. As a kid I liked the hyenas, but now I think they're annoying.The songs are very memorable (except "Be Prepared"), "Can You Feel The Love Tonight" is one of the most beautiful love songs ever. The score of Hans Zimmer is also great. The animation is absolutely stunning and gorgeous. It's ironic to think that this film, who is based on a loose script (ok, it's has borrowed from other stories), was going to be Disney's most successful financial feature ever. The only bad thing in this movie it's the moral becomes a little bit overwhelming beyond the story. Besides that, Lion King it's a excellent movie and it's a shame that the movies afterwards didn't restore Disney's reputation (even some of those movies were great).

                                     Saw this movie when it came out in theaters...saw this movie in 3D in theaters...own this movie in 3D at home. Have seen every sequel, saw the Broadway show twice and plan on seeing it again. What more can you say about this movie? It is timeless, Disney's first original full length animation that was completely their own story, and they may not ever be able to top that. The Lion King will be an all ages favorite for generations to come and people will be singing the music for their whole lives. The Lion King teaches you so many life lessons and all the while you're singing, dancing, and crying along with it. It also was backed by Elton John on the soundtrack which just makes it more epic.

                     No other Disney movie will get the appreciation I give to this marvelous work of art. In the future, this will be a movie I will treasure with my kids. Unlike other Disney classics, The Lion King is the one that will stay with me until the time I die. I watch the film to this very day, and it gives me goose bumps to remember the film that I treasured in my childhood. The landscapes are very well made, the voices are so good, the music is very fascinating, especially the background music. The plot is simple yet awesome and made in such a great way. I introduced this film to my little cousins and they loved it. Lion King is a true work of art that should never be spoiled. I also still play the Lion King Super Nintendo video-game, which I also had in my childhood. Definitely this film will be adored in many generations, and I'm sure I will enjoy it when I'm older. Its worth watching more that 1,000 times.

                                 Walt Disney's "The Lion King". This movie remains near and dear to my heart, and not just because I've grown up with it. This Disney film, with it's beautiful backgrounds, amazing voice talents, wonderful music, addicting songs, and touching moments stay with you for your entire life. Lion King remains one of the few movies I tear up at every time, no matter how old I am. Mufasa's death is undoubtedly one of the saddest deaths in movie history, along with the death of Bambi's mother, and Bridge to Terabithia. Watching the movie in class brings out tissues and "It's my allergy" excuses all around, as Simba nudges his father's still body, begging him to wake up. Eager lion cubs in an elephant graveyard, goose-stepping hyenas, lovable meerkats doing the hula and a lion cub held up in a ray of sunlight are moments that stay with viewers forever. One of Disney's best, and will remain so forever.

Mufasa was killed off.

didn't give this movie 10 stars, are you fans all mad at me? Anyway, this movie is often a fan favourite of many of my friends. Ever since one of my classmates in English class began singing Hakuna Matata, often to annoy me, I have been analyzing this movie and trying hard not to make any fan of this movie mad at me.But I'm getting sidetracked. While the animation (and artwork in general) is astounding and clearly had a lot of effort put in, I find that the story seems to have not as much effort put in.Based on the Shakespeare play Hamlet (and Kimba the White Lion, but I'll get to that later), this film revolves around a lion who, after losing his father to his envious uncle Scar, is convinced to remember his past and that HE should rightfully claim the throne. I like the message that the past can hurt and you can run from it or learn from it, but I feel a lot doesn't work for me.For example, the plot (as I mentioned before) is derived from two great works of fiction. It wouldn't bother me as much if the end credits said "Based on Hamlet by William Shakespeare and Kimba the White Lion by Osamu Tezuka" or if Disney didn't tout it as an original story.Then there's one of my biggest issues with this movie, this movie doesn't know if it wants to be for younger children (3-6) or older children (7-12). While it does deal with mature subjects such as the death of a loved one, responsibility, handling guilt etc, there's too much other stuff in this movie that's immature.It goes without saying that when a protagonist experiences a tragic turn of events, the first thing we want is something that will cheer us up afterwards... for many, Hakuna Matata comes to mind, but... for me, I think there could have been a better way of accomplishing that.Speaking of which, I find only three of the songs from this movie worth listening to, Circle of Life (kudos to Hans Zimmer), Be Prepared (who doesn't admire a song as awesome as this?) and the end credits version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight? (Gotta listen to more Elton John, though). As you might have guessed, Hakuna Matata, while it may have appealed to me some 6-7 years earlier, is now the song I hate the most from this movie. It just blows my mind that a movie like this goes from a lion cub witnessing the murder of his father by a jealous uncle to one of the most annoying and whimsical songs I have ever heard as well as belching and flatulence jokes... see what I mean when I say it's not very clear on the audience it wants to appeal to? I am in disbelief that the guy who wrote songs for Princess Diana's funeral actually wrote a song as annoying as that.Also, there are scenes in this movie that are too intense for younger children, such as the death of Mufasa, the hyena chasing Simba and Nala, Simba and Nala (grown up, and before they recognize each other) fighting and the climax. I would strongly recommend waiting until your kids are 6 or 7 years old, or if they understand how hard it is to handle the death of a loved one.But what I really like about this movie is the father-and-son connection between Simba and Mufasa, which is one of the reasons why you're supposed to find it sad when Mufasa dies, just like why we're supposed to sympathize with Bambi when his mother dies. Whenever you watch Mufasa and Simba conversing happily, you just know there's a connection between the two.Overall, this movie is not bad, but not everything is flawless, and this is no exception. For any fan seething with anger at this review, I see some good stuff in this movie!

                                                           I remember watching this movie when it first came out on video as a little kid. Now I'm grown up and much older, but my feelings about this movie remain the same. It's terrific. One of the first movies I really came to love. Little kids and parents will both enjoy this classic kid's movie from Disney, despite being an older movie.It's easy to understand The Lion King's success if you look at the cast. It's got Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Madge Sinclair, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane, etc. These are great actors, and they do all of their parts well. The comedy was pulled of well, the dramatic scenes were awesome, and the songs are just plain wonderful. I honestly wish Disney made more stuff like this, since I feel some of their recent stuff is horrible. This movie had the plot, scenery, and dialog of a truly great kid's movie.The story is that Simba is a young prince, son of king Mufasa, and heir to the pride-lands. The pride-lands are the beautiful plains where many peaceful animals live. Scar, Mefusa's brother, is outraged that Simba is before him in line for the throne. Scar's corrupt soul only desires to be ruler, so he plots with the outcast hyenas of the out-lands to kill Mefusa and Simba. During the scheme, Mefusa dies while Simba escapes. Simba, however, thinks he's responsible for his father's death because of a chat with Scar. Scar becomes ruler, and his hyena henchmen take over the pride-lands and devour everything.Meanwhile, Simba is rescued and befriended by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog who live carefree lives in a beautiful land away from the pride-lands. Simba learns to live without responsibilities or worries, and puts his past behind him. Then he runs into his old best friend, Nala. Nala tells Simba of what has happened to his homelands, and with some counseling from a baboon named Rafiki, Simba returns home. Accompanied by Nala, Timon, Pumbaa, and even Rafiki, Simba fights scar and takes his place as king.I still have my original VHS copy of this movie, and I still watch it to this day. It is a truly great combination of drama, comedy, life lessons, and musical songs in a Disney movie. This movie is one of the best of all time. Get a copy if you can. You will not be disappointed.

thinking that he caused the death of his own father (James Earl Jones), a young lion cub (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) flees and abandons his destiny as the future king.Disney's strongest period in recent history was the late 1980s and early 1990s. They consistently released hits: "Little Mermaid", "Aladdin", "Beauty and the Beast". The princesses from these films have taken their place alongside the classics (Snow White and Cinderella). Until "Frozen" twenty years later, this success would not be repeated."The Lion King" came at the end of this cycle, and did not feature a princess (at least not in human form). But it is still a great tale of loss, redemption, triumph. Many would place it among the top three Disney cartoons ever made.

                            I am one of those teenagers who grew up in the time of Lion King, and back then I totally enjoyed it. But, having just seen it recently, I feel as if I must write this review. While not considering myself a movie buff, I have seen plenty of movies on AFI's top 250. However, even after seeing some of the best movies of all time, none of them compare to this one. (Biased) This is the best movie of all time, and let me explain. It expresses emotions that no other movie does, and because it is an animated children's movie, it is innocent while doing so. And I don't think anyone can disagree to the fact that the voice acting is loaded with talent, or the fact that the opening song is the most memorable of all time. The animation is fantastic, and HAND DRAWN! No matter how good computer animated films are, they will never achieve the 2D masterpieces Disney had in the 1990s. And this one is the most masterful of all, without a doubt. In a time of movies mostly about immoral behavior, and when the ethics of America are crashing down, we must all go back to happy days of our youth, with the Lion King.



                   I believe that a great movie is one that clearly conveys a strong message. One that you can use to justify your views on various topics. Only a hand full of movies delivered the aforementioned attribute as well as The Lion King. Although this film's plot is enough to prove its brilliance, factors like voice-acting, background themes, dialogs, etc give an attentive viewer more to be impressed with. Case in point: James Earl Jones's voice boosted Mufasa's powerful appearance. The voice had a commanding tone which rivaled Mufasa's powerful roar. Likewise, there are many details that can make this movie the face of Disney. It has been more than 10 years since its release, and it still boasts a strong stance against far more graphically advanced movies. Kids as well as adults can enjoy this flick, possibly without snacks. I rate this film a ten out of ten while suggesting that everyone watch it at least once.

make. This is the first fully animated Disney production that I have ever seen! Perhaps some would say that I have begun at the wrong end (beside the fact that I have been living in a closet all my life), however "The Lion King" (Disney's 32nd full length animated feature) has given me an inkling of what I may have been missing.Disney continue their recent trend of popular animated features by bringing us this tale about the circle of life. Young lion cub "Simba", heir to his father "King Mufasa's" throne, thinks there'll be nothing to assuming his rightful place at the top of the food chain. Things look terribly gloomy though when Simba's evil Uncle Scar kills Mufasa, takes his brother's place as king and drives poor Simba far from his home. The dramatic adventure story that unfolds from here is good, and will keep the kids involved, yet the movie's real strength is its sharp wit and very funny dialogue. Several moments will have you in stitches, while movie buffs will delight in "performances" from many recognisable voices. James Earl Jones is an appropriate choice for Mufasa, Jeremy Irons' Scar is wonderfully sardonic, while comedienne Whoopi Goldberg is a real treat as a nasty Hyena. Listen too for the voices of Matthew Broderick, Rowan Atkinson, Cheech Marin, Robert Guillaume, Ernie Sabella, Nathan Lane and Moira Kelly."The Lion King" is a joy musically too, with Hans Zimmer providing a vibrant African score and both Elton John and Tim Rice some catchy show numbers, including Elton's beautiful love theme "Can You Feel the Love Tonight?" Disney's high production values are clearly evident in a fine animated film which the whole family is sure to thoroughly enjoy.Saturday, October 29, 1994 - Knox District Centre

so solidly fantastic, rewatch after rewatch. The story lures me in with its take on the classic hero's journey, and it keeps me engaged until the very end. The music fits amazingly and gives me goosebumps every single time. As a child, I loved the slapstick humour, and as an adult, I discovered the numerous funny wordplays. The musical songs are fantastic, ranging from spooky (Be Prepared) to romantic (Can You Feel the Love Tonight) to joyful (I Just Can't Wait to Be King). The voice acting is brilliantly on-point, with Rowan Atkinson as Zazu and Jeremy Irons as Scar being my favourites. And on top of everything else, I found the film's plot so satisfyingly coherent, I can't help but give this a 10/10. It just works (for me).

                                                    The best Disney animated move ever made, "The Lion King", was recently re-released in theaters everywhere, in crystal clear, high definition 3-D. I was super excited because "The Lion King" is my all-time favorite Disney animated movie, and the thought of watching this spectacular movie in 3-D, it felt like I'm seeing it for the first time. Everything in the movie is still memorable to this day. The memorable characters we all know and love, including Simba, Timon, Pumbaa, Nala, Rafiki, Mufasa, Scar, and the Hyenas, are still the characters we know from our childhood. Also, Hans Zimmer's incredible music score is breathtaking and exhilarating, and it helped tell the story. Speaking of that, the story is an example of what happens when Shakespeare's Hamlet has lions! It's thrilling, funny, breathtaking, heartbreaking, and it has a message that's truly uplifting. But the best part of the whole movie, is the beautiful and memorable songs brought to us, by Elton John and Tim Rice. Everyday, almost everybody sings to "Circle of Life", "Hakuna Matata", "Just Can't Wait to Be King", and the forever-classic "Can You Feel the Love Tonight?". I hope that all audiences will enjoy a movie like "The Lion King", for the characters, the songs, and it's beautiful heart. It has been an amazing movie-going night to experience the greatest animated movies ever. Long live the lion king! No worries! "The Lion King", in my review, "the most incredible Disney animated movie ever made".

I watched it together with my daughter, and we both enjoyed the movie but from two different horizons... And the characteristics are better placed than in any heavy Ingmar Bergman-movie.I was seven years old when The Jungle Book first appeared, my daughter was 6 when The Lion King came - suddenly I understood why it is The Greatest Movie I have ever seen.

Even the music was so catchy. I literally knew every moments, and scenarios. Until now, I still rewatch it. Simba, Nala, Zazu, Rafiki, Mufasa, Timon and Pumbaa are the best.

                                              Best film ever? Disney at its best? Animation's crowning achievement? Well, I'm sorry to bust 99% of the world's bubble, but this is an EXCEPTIONALLY overrated film that in the past I would have thought good, but now think of as easily the worst animated "masterpiece" ever made by Disney.\nIt's plot is so weak, it can be summarized in at most one paragraph. Every moment is stretched as far as it can go, and more time is filled with irrevelant material, such as songs (which are some of the weakest ever created by Disney, but I'll get to that later) than with actual story. People claim this gives it an "epic" quality. The only way that this could possibly be true is through epic boredom.The characters are shallow and unmemorable. Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa, and the Hyenas are comic relief that are sorely missing comicality (If you want a truly great example of Disney's comical relief, look at the Genie and Iago from Aladdin, or Kronk and Kuzco from The Emperor's New Groove). Simba is an unadmirable hero who I couldn't care less about, and his love with Nala is anything but inexistent. Scar is one of the weakest of the modern Disney villains, and does not make you hate him like Gaston or impress you with his evil so much that you like him like Jafar. The only characters I can pass off as even half-decent are Rafiki and Mufasa.The music I will give merit to as being okay and somewhat enjoyable, but still, it isn't within a hundred miles of the attractive Arabian dances of Aladdin or the Broadway style melody of Beauty and the Beast or the fun Tropical tunes of The Little Mermaid. Only the Circle of Life (even I have to admit that the opening number is magnificent) is as good as any of the songs in the aforementioned films, and just barely. The rest are simply radio-friendly pop tunes.However, one thing I will stop at no ends to give this film credit for is its animation. I will say right now that no other Disney film has backgrounds so richly detailed or characters so well designed. Indeed, the art quality is definitely the most astounding ever created Disney. But art quality alone cannot save this movie from all its other weaknesses, and besides, art quality is probably the least important of the four major aspects of an animated film (the other three being story, characters, and, in the case of Disney, music). This movie does not deserve to be praised as if it is the best Disney can muster. The people who think this is true have probably never seen any truly great Disney films, or just can't realize one. Aladdin, for example, is in my opinion the greatest film, animated or otherwise, ever made (And I am a film buff, to those of you questioning my merits). Beauty and the Beast is in my top 10, and many others would probably crack my top 100. The Lion King, however, is depressingly mediocre, and deserves at most a 5. I give it a 2 only for the art quality.

Quite a spectacle, especially the wildebeast stampede that kills the father, the final battle, the humour of the Laurel and Hardy types Timon and Puumba, etc. The music is terrific too. No wonder this made 300M in '94, it should have been nominated for best film of the year too, Lord knows it was better than Forrest Gump.***1/2 outta ****

On every level, it is perfect until Simba is exiled, then I believe the film devolves only slighting. The character development, plot, humor, and animation are all on point. I only issue, which is small, is the predictability of the plot after Simba leaves, destined to return. The message is clear and good: Do not forget who you are/where you came from. 9/10 (almost perfect)

                                                The film is such a heart-warming story. The movie is about a young lion named simba, who is tricked into thinking he is responsible for his father's death, and then leaves the pride with guilt and goes off on his own. He grows up alone, but on the way he meets a lifelong friend who has its funny moments, its action, and it's really the perfect movie for kids. For adults, the acting was great, the story was good, and it was predictable, but not when I was a kid. So it's a warm movie

I've loved it since I was a child and I still love it now. Definitely makes me cry every time I watch it. Damn it. I love the concept of the movie and I love the characters. The characters are very different and each have their own personality. My favorite characters are definitely Timon and Pumbaa. "It means no worries, for the rest of your days. It's our problem free, philosophy, Hakuna Matata." I even re-watched the movie when it came back out into theaters in 3D! It was absolutely fantastic. I don't think I could ever get sick of this movie. Absolutely loved it. Emotional, thrilling (in a good way), and a great classic Disney movie.

1994 and like snow white and the seven dwarfs and cinderella I saw the lion king thousand times but the only difference is the rewatching value the story is more logic and fits the adults more and the characters are wonderful, interesting and great Simba's journey to discover himself and face his past is so deep and anyone can get it with everyone develoe through the movie and the introduction of the most evil character in Disney history in Addition to the great animation which made difference in the animation industry with great soundtracks and epic music and all of this in 1h28m that made the movie epic with great voice acting especially Jeremy irons. At last the lion king is the best best animation movie Disney have ever made.

                           A lion cub is destined to become king of the pride, but faces major life challenges along the way.This is a brilliantly animated movie with great all round entertainment.The Lion King has possibly Disney's most recognisable opening sequence that is a perfect mix of animation, visual storytelling and music. This sets the scene incredibly well for the story, which is partially a remake of Bambi, but set in Africa with stronger character arcs that evoke a sense of Shakespearian tragedy.It relies more on the dialogue between characters and songs for entertainment than Bambi. These aspects for me are mostly good, but not every song works nor joke lands. However, this very much down to personal taste, so if you love all the material you might find it a perfect animated feature.The animation is brilliant and worth googling to find out all the details behind the creative process. I love how epic the artists make it feel with a variety of perspectives. The landscapes and weather conditions are incredibly designed. Plus the characters look and move like the real wild animals, whilst showing distinct personalities, which is also down to the voice performances.James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons are perfectly cast, plus the comic relief of Rowan Atkinson, Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are also standouts.

betrayal,friendship,love,great songs etc. It even won oscars! If you don't like it you definitely don't appreciate your life or other people's work.

                                 The story opens well and makes you begin to care for the animals who live at Pride Rock. You feel like Symba is kind of spoiled (even though there are only 3 male lions in all the Pride Lands). The story introduces Nala and Symba's relationship as "just friends" which we all know that in a Disney Movie it means they will get married by the end. When Mufasa died, the world cried. Next, the third male lion takes over Pride Rock (since no other males are there to challenge him.) Symba has been forced to live with two hooligans in the wild growing up eating bugs. That is not healthy for a growing lion. He needed real meat, which is probably why Symba was a lot smaller than his dad. When Symba finally comes back, him and the lionesses fight with an army of thousands of hyenas, somehow winning. But who cares! Scar is eaten alive for his betrayal of the hyenas and eventually the damage of years of drought and fire and famine are replaced in a very short amount of time. They all lived happily ever after. The movie The Lion King was an excellent movie that could be watched many times over. It gave amazing life lessons, like how to find who you are and never to listen it your sketch uncle. Over all this movie can emotionally move pretty much everyone, if it doesn't then you likely have no soul.

It's a film I've introduced all of my nieces and nephews too, and one day I'll introduce my own kids to this too. The circle of life story is so key for us all. There will always be hard moments and evil people we have to deal with, but we can overcome it with some help from some good and true people in our lives. That moment in the end when Simba finally walks up the rock to rightfully claim his place as king and roars, always gets me; they manage to capture how tough the struggle is and even with the look of awe from his friends and family in that moment, I just love it and I love this film. I always think kid stories should teach people about good and evil and the Lion King does this brilliantly. In that way its a kids and adult story all in one, and as a young adult, I still think it's brilliant! I can't recall how many times I've watched the play in London and NYC, and have taken friends and family to see this too. This will always be a classic. I can't wait till this is back in the theatre (London and New York) - already planning to take some of my young family members to see it early next year when it should hopefully be safe.

entertaining, ends up being kind of disappointing by the end. The reasons for this are many and varied.First off, the film is very short. Only 88 minutes. I do not know why, but I thought that this film was supposed to be about 2 hours long. I think it is because I have always heard how much of an epic quality the film had. This is simply untrue. The film has very little in the way of script. Not much really happens in the film. You could probably sum up in only a couple of sentences.The characters and situations of the film are somewhat trite. It is unfair to dismiss this category of criticism because this a children's cartoon. The heroes and villains of other Disney films are much less formulaic, as well as the challenges they encounter (e.g., The Little Mermaid, Pinnochio, Beauty and the Beast).  Simba's challenge was a bit interesting, but, as I complained above, it is brought up and resolved in a half-hour's time. The only characters I found really interesting were the villains, and not Scar, but the Heyenas.It is this third complaint which actually pushed me into the realm of disliking this film: the music. I've always felt that the music of Disney's animated fare was bad. There are three exceptions I can think of offhand: The Little Mermaid, Pinnochio, and the Jungle Book. All other Disney animated films have a collection of some of the worst music that has ever been produced. I think The Lion King takes the cake for general rottenness in the music department. There was not one song that did not make me cringe.All in all, surely the Lion King is okay for kids, but there are so many better films, even from Disney's canon, that one should expose their children to. My suggestions are any of those Disney films I've listed as good above. As for non-Disney films, I think My Neighbor Totoro (age range 2-10, I would say) and Kiki's Delivery Service (age range 6-18; the best lessons ever of responsibility and self-reliance are found in this film), both from Japan but also both easily available in any video store dubbed into English, are the two best films for children ever made. Also, The Prince of Egypt is pretty good for slightly older children (I would put The Lion King in the 3-8 age range and The Prince of Egypt from 9-13). I give The Lion King 5/10 = good for children, pretty uninteresting to adults.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, The Lion King (1994) is a Disney masterpiece. It provides a colorful and multi-emotional experience while subtly delivering an important life message, enjoyable for people of all ages. Not many films are so enveloping as to successfully simultaneously deliver an action-packed adventure, romance, and comedy. Throughout the entire film, the audience is entranced by the wondrous diegesis that is created, and so easily mourns when it is supposed to mourn and laughs when it is supposed to laugh. The Lion King uses animals as opposed to humans (as in Shakespeare's Hamlet), but this contributes to the experience and message rather than takes away from them. Under all the emotion, this charming film makes a social statement, that the circle of life must inevitably continue, and death should be accepted as long it is part of the natural cycle. As a perfect mix of an emotional experience and a moral message, it's no wonder that The Lion King raked in so much revenue and is seen as one of the best films in Disney history.In many parts of the narrative, the audience is completely wrapped up by the magical atmosphere that the film creates, with help from its beautiful original score. In the scene where Mufasa dies, the audience follows Simba, both visually and emotionally, through the discovery of his father's limp body and the acceptance of his passing away. The audience feels the fear and desperation of the little Simba cub as he sees Mufasa motionless on the floor. The audience weeps for Simba as he tries to "wake up" his father. Later in the film, when adult Simba meets Nala, the musical accompaniment, "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" (composed by Elton John) (1994), really creates the romantic mood that devours the audience's heart. When Timon and Pumbaa break the audience out of that oneiric state with their funny antics, and even when they break the fourth wall, they offer a reprieve from the intense emotion present in the rest of the film. These reprieves strengthen the emotions created rather than diminish them. They are an asset to the deep emotions awakened by The Lion King.The use of lions instead of humans might be expected to reduce the emotional intensity of the film, but instead it actually, in some ways, increases it. With animals, the audience experiences defamilarization, as the death of a lion, although still sad, is less taboo and tragic than a death of human. If human Scar had murdered human Mufasa, the audience would experience boundless hate for Scar, rather than experiencing the sadness of Simba as it was supposed to. Using animals also made the diegesis much more colorful and kid-friendly. Using human characters would have created a whole other unwanted experience.Aside from the emotional aspect of the film, The Lion King also disguises a powerful social statement. At the end of the film, the child of Simba and Nala is declared the heir of the pride, as Simba was at the beginning of the film. This metaphorically completes "The Circle of Life" (also composed by Elton John) (1994), the title of the opening score. The audience learns that Mufasa's death was inevitable, and sooner or later Simba will die too. Death must happen to complete the cycle, and the past should not be clung on to. This important message is what makes The Lion King more than a simple narrative and a delight for 5-year-olds and 50-year-olds alike.The Lion King was made 17 years ago, yet still stands as an artful classic, despite it being an animation movie. This is a result of the intense emotional experience that an audience can't help but be enveloped by, and a powerful life lesson that is delivered flawlessly. Throughout the action, romance, and sudden comedy, the audience follows without any difficulty at all, and at the end, learns a valuable lesson. The choice to use animals also benefited the film. Aside from making the film more kid-friendly, it precisely manipulated the audience's feelings. The Lion King is a shining gem in film history, a gem that will truly stand the test of time.The Lion King will remain one of my favorite films for a long time, and if you haven't seen it yet, you definitely should.

From the opening scenes of the sunrise of the African Plains, to the ending this film is brilliant. The story is about a young cub named Simba who's next in line to be King of Pride Rock after his father.But tragically his father gets killed by stampedes by his father's evil brother Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons)who wants to take over as King Of Pride Rock. Simba runs away only to meet up with two hilarious sidekicks Timon and Pumbaa. They of course tell Simba that his got to put the past behind him and move on with life. As he gets older(now voiced by Matthew Broderick) he meets with his former friend Nala(voiced by Moira Kelly)who is shocked to discover that Simba is next in line to become King.Overall what do I think of this movie well at the age of 22 this movie NEVER fails to make me cry(this was the first ever Disney movie in history to make me cry,the second is Tangled which is hands down my all time favourite movie ever) and to this day TLK never gets old even though its 17 years old its still to this day my 2nd favourite movie of all time. Beautiful Animation,excellent voice cast,brilliant story(even though some people say its a rip off of Hamlet,yeah who gives a hoot). Overall im giving this a solid 10/10

It is based on some Shakespearean and mythological works and the influence definitely shows as the scale seems very epic. Not to mention this engaging story is backed up by some amazing animation and energetic soundtrack. It follows the life of the prince Simba from his birth to his adulthood and all the tribulations faced along the way, with a cast of memorable characters like the seer Rafiki, the villain Scar, the father Mufasa and the waste fellows Timon and Pumbaa. Every single moment is infused with pure energy and pathos. A must-see.

                                 One of my favorite Disney movies of all time. Always will be. Although I cry every time I watch it.

It is considered by many 'the best' of Disney. I don't agree with that, there are better films. But still, it is the last of a kind.I first saw it in the cinema in December 1994, with my parents, sister, godfather and his wife and kids. I was 10 at the time. It was in a cinema I used to go many times back then and which I first saw other Disney films, like 'Aladdin' and 'Beauty and the Beast', for example.The original 1994 version is the true version for me. The version with that dumb 'Morning Report' scene has no reason to exist and is completely unnecessary. Seriously, did they think that people were really gonna accept that? Aside that it's the same movie but why changing a movie, even if it's only for 1 minute?The beauty of the artwork is one of the film's best attributes. It shows us beautiful landscapes of Africa and includes, among other things, the gorgeous sunrises and sunsets characteristic of Africa. We know this takes place somewhere in Africa but we don't know where exactly. They call it "Pride Lands" in the film...The lions and lionesses are extremely well drawn and handsome and their roars are very realistic, so much that I wonder if they used real lions in stage or if it was very talented people roaring like that.Simba is very pretty and cute as a lion cub and grows looking similar to his father. Mufasa always fascinated me and even now he still fascinates me: he is a gorgeous lion, powerful, with an imposing and majestic figure, a strong voice, a brutal strength and an amazing physique. Mufasa really is a 'Sir Lion'.Scar is one of the great Disney villains and he really has that cold and harsh look on his face and eyes.Timon and Pumba are two goofy but funny characters. They are clearly stupid, but more of a comic relief than anything else. I don't particularly like the hyenas, but Ed is a funny one, perhaps for being a mute character like Dopey ('Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs') and Gideon ('Pinocchio'). It's hilarious when Ed laughs hysterically because of the way Mufasa scared them away.However, Mufasa's death is one of the most severe things for a child to watch and the sequence itself is depressing, easy to make some tears come to our eyes.As for the voice cast, talents vary, but some do an excellent job, like James Earl Jones as Mufasa, Jonathan Taylor Thomas as infant Simba, Jeremy Irons as Scar and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu.The soundtrack is great. It has two versions of 'Circle of Life' and 'Can you feel the love tonight'. In the case of 'Circle of Life', I like both versions. In the case of 'Can you feel the love tonight', I prefer Elton John's version.I also enjoy the songs 'Hakuna Matata', 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight', 'Be Prepared' and the silly song 'Asante sana squash banana', but I adore 'I Just Can't Wait To Be King' and those instrumental-vocal songs which resemble African sounds and at the same time they have this dark feeling in them. The movie's environment is a mix of paradise and darkness.

this universally beloved feature would most definitely be in the upper echelon. It's quite rare these days to find someone who has not seen this...and if you haven't well, I'm disappointed in you. The story revolves around the 'Circle of Life', paraphrasing nature's way of taking and giving back life to earth. As current lion king Mufasa teaches his son Simba how to be a great king, his brother Scar secretly plans to obtain the throne of Pride Rock for himself. There's not much I can say that everybody else hasn't mentioned. Hans Zimmer composing yet another epic orchestral masterpiece. The first time that the music and animation blended together in perfect harmony. Elton John and Tim Rice's musical numbers are some of the best Disney has to offer. Literally every song is memorable, my personal favourite being "Just Can't Wait To Be King". The animation is absolutely beautiful and still holds well even by today's standards. The effortless blend of red sunsets and green grassy plains. The computer animation used during the wildebeest stampede might look slightly dated, but it doesn't detract from the enjoyment to be had here. Then we come to the voice acting...oh God damn it's perfect. James Earl Jones as Mufasa was inspired. Jeremy Irons as Scar was sensational. Heck, even Rowan Atkinson as Zazu worked! Every actor provided a voice that gave life to the animation. Not a single voice felt out of place. A nice light comedic script to balance the more powerful themes it conveys such as fatherhood, death and facing your past. The inclusion of Timon and Pumbaa was just the comedy the film required, and I'm sure children will adore these two. Whilst this is undoubtedly one of Disney's best, I do find the third act slightly unmemorable compared to the amazing first two acts. It just feels slightly rushed and concludes far too rapidly. Minor gripe aside, The Lion King is a film that is indefinitely adored by everyone.

it is same situation and lion king is the best animated film ever at least in my opinion there are plenty of great ones like aladdin,beauty and beast,toy story franchise and japanese one mononoke,spirited away...but only this one was able to hit me deep and hard and i felt something that i thought it doesnt exist in me,animation is brilliant here and it is top quality still today,also voice actors expecely james earl jones and jeremy irons did a wonderful jobs in it but lets not also forger broderick,atkinson and woopi who were also impressive,the lion king is masterpiece of animation and storytelling mixed with some life changing messages and lessons,go watch this right now and lets pretend that live action film never happened

masterpiece in American cinema! The Lion King was what originally got me interested in the art of film and is one of my all time favorites.I had not actually seen The Lion King when it was released in 2012 for almost 5 years, and I was hoping it would hold up and I am so happy that it did. In fact, looking back I probably enjoy it more now than when I did when I was younger, there is so much more to talk about such as the music, the storytelling, the voice acting among many other elements. First of all, Simba; Simba is one of the most sympathetic Disney characters, we have all been in a situation where we have felt the need to step up and rise to an occasion and Simba represents that perfectly, he (as an adult) tries to come off as confident but you can tell he is hurting and is conflicted inside but eventually puts this fear aside to do what he knows he must. The supporting characters were all great, particularly the hyenas who I find a lot funnier now, maybe because of my twisted sense of humor. Scar as the villain was awesome, one of the best movie villains ever. He is a silver-tonged devil, he manipulates his nephew and tries to get him killed then actually kills his own brother, which is a lot deeper when you really think about it. We also get some good humor out of him as well, you also see how pathetic he is when he takes over, showing how unfit he is to be king.The songs were awesome, the opening sequence "The Circle of Life" is the greatest sequence ever and when I'm watching the film, I always watch it at least thrice. The songs range from being jumpy to traditionally African to menacing to slow and romantic, the greatest range in a Disney film. Overall, Disney had it back then and still has it today.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                In a difficult situation is a person who undertakes to once again address to the topic of "The Lion King". According to the number of mentions in the media and among the conversations of ordinary people, he has long been on the same level with such parables as "Titanic", "Terminator" and "Cleopatra". And say about this cartoon, that either new extremely difficult. This with one hand.On the other hand, taking into account all said before now of course it is difficult to find someone who hadn't watched "The Lion King".Accordingly, in the details of the plot go there is no sense of the subtleties of the characters, too, can not be explained for the same reason.But there is an opportunity to focus on the story of the inner features of the masterpiece for which it is so loved for quite a long period of time.I'll start with the fact that the theme of giving animals human qualities in animation (and in some cases, and feature films) is not new.Remember the series "Goofy and his team", "TaleSpin", "Duck stories", "Darkwing Duck" ?These stories, familiar to us since childhood, serve as a brilliant confirmation of the above theory.But here's the amazing thing. None of these failed to achieve the naturalness of what is happening in "The Lion King".The characters of this cartoon do not wear human clothes and do not try to behave like people, which does not always appropriate comic and increases the sense of realism of the screen image.After 10-15 minutes after you start watching you began to think that animals really can talk, although an hour ago you were firmly convinced of the opposite.Not only that, the animals suddenly started talking in human language, their emotions may be quite to compete in the sincerity of the feelings and actions of living people.Even the famous Konstantin Stanislavsky would not find a reason to say his famous "I do not believe!" because the cartoon characters constantly and sincerely empathize.Many eternal philosophical questions are raised by "The Lion King": "What is life? What's its meaning?", "How to find your way?", "Will we seem right that we as or think in 15 years when we're 25?". All these questions the viewer will find the answer looking and reviewing this wonderful cartoon in which there was a place for all spiritual manifestations of man. Even the main negative character of the film Mufasa's brother Scar figure is not as unambiguous as it may seem at first.Of course in the struggle for power, he does not shun the lowest methods, but in all he is not right from a political point of view?He and his older brother just have diametrically different views on how to rule the state.Mufasa mostly relies on his strength, he, in modern parlance, professes a authoritative regime.Scar in the soul is more democratic. He says plainly: "With regard to mind I got the lion's share, but on the part of brute force is out of a genetic misfire". He's cunning and hypocritical on occasion. Isn't that an important quality for a politician? Isn't that an important quality for a sovereign?Our unforgettable Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin would estimate that for certain.Someone can argue with that citing the example of what happened to the Pride Lands during the reign of Scar. Recognize, Liony played too much and made a huge mistake: did not secure the support of the people and too much dissolved hyenas -traditional enemies of lions. Scar not change his nature and whether he in this situation behave wiser cartoon would end quite differently.Anyway, but nevertheless this story has a happy ending and despite the controversy of many moments I am convinced that this happy end heroes deserved. They made the right choice although for many of them it was not easy to make.Even Timon and Pumbaa decided support his friend Simba in a difficult minute. Quote: "Simba, if this is important to you we are with you until the end". TimonAnd they have always been true Epicureans and never bothered with complex issues of morality and law.Well, when you need to help loved ones, each of us can become better and it's wonderful.I in turn hope that this wonderful cartoon called "The Lion King" will help to become better for everyone who will watch it.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I apologise to all those captivated by the African landscapes and orchestral harmonies, but this movie is disjointed and shallow. The mass of names credited with the "Story" says it all - this movie is a bunch of disconnected scenes thrown together with absolutely no character cohesion at all. Some examples:Simba and Narla bicker and argue. They then sing "Can you feel the love tonight?" They then IMMEDIATELY continue to bicker and argue, and part ways.Simba goes from little kid to mature adult - Timon and Pumba do not age a day.After Mufasa safely brings himself and Simba up the cliff, he is then thrown to his death, and Simba never sees this as unusual or even wonder why.There are absolutely no male lions anywhere in the entire movie other than Mufasa, Scar and Simba - an entire tribe of Lions at pride rock, with no males at all.Timon and Pumba play absolutely no role in the plot, meaning or interest of the movie. They are shallow comic diversions that have no place being there. Their theme song (Hakuna Matata) contradicts the entire message of the movie, which is to live up to your responsibilities instead of ignoring them.Not one lion in Pride Rock EVER wonders what happened to Simba, and nor does the annoying bird Zazu, who was right there when it all happened - this is utterly ridiculous.Scar would never have simply admitted to killing Mufasa.After years of constant threats and derision, Mufasa is surprised when Scar turns against him, as if he never suspected a thing...I could go on for a long time. This movie makes no sense, it is too scary and murderous for young children, and it completely lacks any emotional involvement with any character. The young Simba is utterly arrogant, the old Simba completely distant, and his change of character totally unbelievable and contrived.Yes, this movie "deals" with many grand themes - it deals with them in the same way a food processor would "deal" with a 3 course meal - mash it all up into random unpalatable rubbish. Yes, the themes are there, but the movie has nothing to say about any of them, and they are presented in a completely disjointed manner. Comparisons to Hamlet is one of the greatest insults possible to Shakespeare.If you want a good kids movie, The Lion King IS NOT IT.

example of the studio's strengths. It's a very familiar story - basically Hamlet with singing animals - but they really make it their own through charm, whimsey and simple, effective characterization. The animation is excellent, too, silky smooth and grounded in reality but also expressive, colorful and often downright stunning. Musicals aren't usually my thing, though, and once or twice it felt like the tunes were being crammed into a scene when they really weren't necessary. Still, it's a vibrant, attention-demanding classic that held my kids' hearts from start to finish and authentically embraces an under-appreciated culture. Deservedly one of animation's upper tier titles, it was really cool to share it with a new generation.

                                                        I first saw The Lion King when I was about 5 years old, I was hooked from the start and found it was unlike any other Disney movie I have ever seen since then. Sure, there are heroes in Disney that search for their destiny in life in other films, but The Lion King tells it in a unique light, with a much deeper meaning. The Lion King has many great point, from the music, down to the detail for characters, with some really good lessons for Your kids that will possibly help them later in their lives. One thing I really enjoyed about this film was the Characters, I enjoyed how real they were, it made me feel like I was in the movie. The realistic behavior of Simba and Nala as children was on point, it shows how kids are innocent and don't know any better, while also showing the view point of an adult, and the dynamic between Father and son. I also liked the strong scenes in the film, when Mufasa appeared in the clouds to speak to Simba I was taken back, because it actually made me feel something in my heart, it deeply touched me. Further more I loved how the characters had flaws, but their good characteristics balanced with the bad (all except for Scar). The movie goes through points of development, and many emotions. The animation, and attention to detail in this movie was wonderful, it was extremely well done, well thought out, and well planned. This is truly Disney's best film as many people say, this movie will stick with me, and will forever remain timeless.

Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg are great for the roles they do and this movie should be seen if you haven't yet. Also, great animations are another plus for the movie.85% Very good for an animation film.

                                         The lion king is one of my favourite movies of all time. It is possibly Disney's best movie and is one that any person of any age group will adore. My dad worked for Disney's video department and he got all the great Disney movies and of all of them the lion king is perhaps the best along with Aladdin and toy story. It has the worst Disney villain in the form of scar, has a truly touching story which captivates the watcher and has some of the best Disney characters to date. It won 2 Oscars one of them for best original song in the shape of "can you feel the love tonight". Personally i much prefferd and thought that "the circle of life" "I just cant wait to be king" or "Hakuna Matata". This is possibly the last great hand drawn Disney movie as well as toy story followed up a couple of years later.

touching Disney classic about survival and self-discovery for all ages that will warm your heart. I really loved the music. If I could have, I would have helped young Simba (voice of Jonathan Taylor Thomas) get to safety myself. The only problem is how I would get them to safety, since I don't drive. All in all, the music was good, the animation was perfect, everyone was cast perfectly, and the direction was flawless. In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching movie about survival and self-discovery for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll thoroughly enjoy it.

                                               I have always loved Disney animations with a few exceptions and this, I am afraid, is one of them. The actual animation is pretty good, though I hate the anthropomorphism of the animals and the dreadful americanisation of the young lions' voices.Rowan Atkinson and Jeremy Irons are the best things in it. The most dreadful thing about the film, though, is the music. Horrible "modern" pop does not work for me and Elton John /Tim Rice combo was a bad choice for writers. I am watching it now as I type and like it even less than I thought I did. I guess an old curmudgeon like me was never the target audience for this as I am aware of it's huge success with most of the cinema-going public. I hanker for the days of Pinocchio, Snow White and Bambi - they never seemed to be as cynical as this movie. They were made with love and commitment rather than an exercise in multimedia marketing.

                                            When Disney released "The Lion King" during the busy summer of 1994, during which Forrest Gump would become the best picture winner and millions of people watched the OJ bronco chase on TV during an NBA Finals game between the Knicks and Rockets and ordering pizza in droves, it became a cultural milestone not only at the box office, but in merchandising. The storyline on the movie blends in MacBeth with African culture in 84 minutes of pure excitement. The movie tells the story of Simba, a young cub lion raised by Mufasa and his wife Sarabi, who travels the plains and meets up with Nala and their companion bird Zazu, along with the predictable monkey Rafiki. During a stampede, Simba watches in horror as his dad falls into the running crowd after losing grip of Scar's paws, causing him to perish into lion heaven. On his own, Simba meets up with Timon and Pumbaa, and they grow up to be like adults. In the end, Simba fights Scar to the death and helps Nala give birth to Kion, who will become the next lion king in the made for video sequel The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. As for Timon and Pumbaa, they will return in an animated tv series and a prequel between lion king 1 and 2 called lion king 1 and a half. A tv series called the lion guard would soon follow, and a live action remake will bring new audiences who didn't grow up watching the original will get a chance to relive it all over again!!! As for the movie itself, it's timeless and memorable. I first saw this movie when it was in theatres and it stunned me. I would relive it over again when i saw it on vhs and again on DVD in a special edition that adds in a happy song, "Morning Report", as well as the IMAX soundtrack from the reissue in addition to the original 5.1 theatrical soundtrack. A 3D conversion would soon goose up the profits until Frozen broke the record for highest grossing cartoon in modern dollars.

                                   Beautiful animation - the picture is not just pleasing to the eye, it radiates warmth;\na good story based on which the cartoon is made;great music by Elton John;magnificent and memorable songs (who does not remember hakuna - matata);several heroes over which you can laugh heartily (it is now a tradition in any cartoon to shove a little idiot who relies on laughing);two tragic moments that make calm people ache in the heart, and the faint of heart like me start to sob;well, of course Happy End.

these years! This is one of my favorite Disney movies, ranked high up on the list along with Tangled and Little Mermaid. I am so happy that they finally re-released it on DVD!! I only wish that I had bought it when it was first released on DVD so that I could have gotten the 2 disc special. Although some of the songs are cheesy and others are great, like, I Can't Wait to be King!! I believe that this movie will continue to be a Disney classic. I just hope that my kids will enjoy this movie as much as I always have.Hakuna Matata!

                         A breakthrough for Disney, this animated film is set in Africa and the main character is a prince instead of a princess, who is tricked into thinking he killed his father and

As a young teenager back then, I saw it opening weekend on the big screen and remember thinking that it was a very visually engrossing film. In terms of capturing realistic movements and sweeping scenery, the animation in THE LION KING had easily surpassed any of its animated predecessors, and for that I found the movie fantastic. As an adult now, I realize just how superficial my initial attitude toward the film was. If there's one thing that today's overabundance of CGI has taught me, it's that there's more to a film than just "looking good". You need story, compelling characters, an original and well-defined conflict, and, especially in the case of animation, an artistic hand with which to draw. There's no denying that many talented artists were at work on THE LION KING, unfortunately too much effort was put forth in animation achievements and too little in developing a solid story and a clever script. Like many other IMDb users, there's no denying that this film was adapted from Shakespeare's HAMLET, just as Disney's 1988 film OLIVER AND COMPANY was adapted from Dickens' OLIVER TWIST. I wonder why Disney did not acknowledge its blatant robbery of subject matter. This is unfortunately just a minor detail in my dislike for THE LION KING. This was, in my opinion, the first in a series of many films that signaled the deterioration of Disney's traditional hand drawn animation department. No doubt about it, they were in a definite slump in the 1980's: THE FOX AND THE HOUND, THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE, THE BLACK CAULDRON (ugh!), but with a fresh new crew in their animation department and a galvanizing reinvention of the formula for animated musicals in THE LITTLE MERMAID, it seemed that Disney had gotten back on its feet. Alas, THE LITTLE MERMAID, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and ALADDIN were merely Disney's Indian summer, for with THE LION KING came a completely new generation of animated films. With THE LION KING and its followers, viewers were bombarded with a predictable stories, numerous pop culture references, an obnoxious slew of celebrity voices, dated 90's pop songs, campy humor, and heaping spoonfuls of sugary melodrama. Don't get me wrong, many of Disney's previous efforts had many of the same deficits and only a handful of them would I consider near-perfect, but the animated flicks of old never attempted to sell out their audiences in the way that THE LION KING did. Yet somehow all of these flaws are what made THE LION KING the most successful animated film in Disney history. Call me old school, but I do not think that Walt would have approved of this. Since THE LION KING's release and the replacement of traditional animation with CGI, animation I feel has lost its art. I dare you to re-watch LADY AND THE TRAMP, BAMBI, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, or anything made pre-1960 and compare it to such 90's fares as THE LION KING. You will notice that the films today no longer resemble moving paintings as they once did and as was the original intention of animation. Still, my opinion of THE LION KING, as well as the rubbish that followed (POCAHONTAS THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, HERCULES...okay, MULAN was not bad up until its pop-music ending..THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE???!!!) seems to be the minority. None of these later Disney flicks were works of art, they were just another form of advertisement---predictable story with the feel-good moral of an ending, comic relief sidekicks, a pop song rolling during the end credits, etc. Yes, they all have very admirable morals (what makes a true hero???...it is important to embrace diversity...who's the real monster here???)but (gasp!!!) that's unnecessary political propaganda. Disney wasn't always that wholesome (Does anyone remember the Siamese Cat song from LADY AND THE TRAMP or "What made the Red Man Red" from PETER PAN?) and, even when they did take America's sensitivity into consideration, it never overwhelmed the entire project. Oh well, censorship is a completely different subject that needs not be addressed in this review. The point that I'm trying to make is that somewhere along the road animation was no longer considered art but simply cheap entertainment guaranteed to make money. And when I hear praise for films like THE LION KING for merely manipulating the general population with special effects, melodramatic plot twists, pop songs, and cheesy one-liners (not to mention lame attempts at comedy via ninja-fighting), I think back to when an animated film was not just a movie, but an idea, a seed, a creative project, an event, and and art form, and I am saddened.

Basically, in the Pride Lands of Africa, at Pride Rock, the lions rule over the animal kingdom. There Simba, the new-born son of King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Queen Sarabi (Madge Sinclair), is being presented to the large gathering of animals by Rafiki the mandrill (Robert Guillaume), the kingdom's shaman and advisor. Mufasa shows young Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) the Pride Lands, explaining his responsibilities as king, and the "circle of life", which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba to become king himself. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala (Niketa Calame-Harris), who are betrothed, into exploring the forbidden land. In the elephant graveyard, the lion cubs are attacked by three spotted hyenas, Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), Banzai (Cheech Marin), and Ed (Jim Cummings), who are in league with Scar. Mufasa rescues them after being alerted by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu (Rowan Atkinson). Mufasa is upset with Simba, but forgives him, he tells him the great kings of the past are in the night sky, they will always be there to guide him, as he will be one day. Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge, while a stampede of wildebeest is driven by the hyenas to trample him. He informs Mufasa, who saves Simba but hangs perilously trying to climb out of the gorge. Scar refuses to save him and causes him to fall onto the stampeding herd. Simba finds Mufasa dead, Scar convinces him that this tragedy is his fault, and tells him to run away and never return. The hyenas are ordered to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride about the deaths of Mufasa and Simba, appoints himself as king, and allows the hyenas to live in Pride Rock. Simba has collapsed in the desert, he is rescued by friends and outcasts Timon the meerkat (Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa the warthog (Ernie Sabella). They take pity on him, telling him to put his past behind him, citing their motto "Hakuna Matata", meaning "no worries". Timon and Pumbaa allow him to live in their jungle paradise. Simba (Matthew Broderick) grows up as a carefree adult. Meanwhile the Pride Lands have been reduced to a wasteland under Scar's rule. Timon and Pumbaa are walking through the jungle singing "The Lion Sleeps Tonight", when a hungry adult lioness tries to attack them. Simba fights her, but realises it is Nala (Moira Kelly) grown up. She and Simba reunite and fall in love. She urges him to return home, telling him that Pride Lands have been destroyed, feeling guilty for his father's death he refuses and storms off. He then encounters Rafiki, who discovered he was still alive, he tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, following this he decides to return home. Aided by Timon and Pumbaa, Simba sneaks past the hyenas and confronts Scar. He taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, there he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to tell the truth to the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fight against the hyenas, Scar tries to escape, until he is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Simba spares his life but orders him to leave and never return. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to throw him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterwards, the rain starts to fall, the other animals watch as Simba finally ascends Pride Rock and roars to announce his kingship. Later, Pride Rock is restored to its usual state, animals are gathered as King Simba and Queen Nala look over their kingdom, and Rafiki presents their new-born cub. Also starring Zoe Leader as Sarafina, Frank Welker as Lion Roars, Tony Jay as Hyenas, and B.J. Ward as Lions. The voice cast are all terrific, especially Jones as the father and Irons as the villain, the colourful animation is wonderful, the story inspired by biblical stories and Shakespeare's Hamlet is good, it makes you laugh and cry, and the songs composed by Sir Elton John and written by Sir Tim Rice are memorable anthems, a most satisfactory animated musical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Music for Hans Zimmer, and Best Song for "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" (also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Song for "Circle of Life" (also nominated the Golden Globe), and Best Song for "Hakuna Matata", it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Original Score - Motion Picture. It was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, it was number 99 on 100 Years, 100 Songs for "Hakuna Matata", it was number 94 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!

Lion King is easily Disney's most successful and entertaining film ever! Every character is unique in their own way. The Music is not of this world. Circle of Life is the song I want on my funeral. (Listen to the lyrics and you'll see why) Each song is so reminiscent towards my long lost childhood. For some reason, I Just Can't Wait To Be King excels most on that. Hans Zimmer score is the greatest I've heard in my life. Thank God he took the Oscar home! This film is most tragic to me, and uplifting at the same time. It's sad that Disney will never ever make a film just like this again. But hey, they couldn't even if they tried! So from the story, to the voice acting, animation, music, and so on, this is the GREATEST film ever!

                                            My comments may contain some SPOILERS. I believe everyone knows the story already, but please take note, you may not want to read further if you have not seen "The Lion King."The Lion King follows a formula similar to other Disney animated movies, like Tarzan and Dinosaur. An orphaned baby is raised by a strange species, the baby eventually grows up to figure out what his real role is, then fights and beats an erstwhile 'leader' to claim the 'leader of the pack.' In this movie, Simba (voiced by Matthew Broderick) is next in line for king, after his father Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones). But evil uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) wants to be king, cooperates with hyenas, causes a stampede forcing Mufasa to rescue young cub Simba, Mufasa dies at the paws of his brother Scar, who then tells Simba to run, assuming the hyenas will eat him. The cub eludes the hyenas through a brier patch, but almost dies in the desert, buzzards surround him, when a weasel and his warthog come along, the warthog butts the birds out of the way, yelling "bowling for buzzards!"So, the unlikely pair befriend young Simba, and he grows up into a magnificent young lion, spitting image of his dad. (The young Dinosaur had been raised by lemurs, the young Tarzan by apes, similar themes.) Meanwhile Scar as king causes all the animals but hyenas to leave, their home becomes a desolate wasteland. Simba is lured back by his "duty" after seeing an image of dad in the clouds, challenges Scar, mates with his cub hood girlfriend, and a new cub is presented. "The circle of life." Symbolically, the moment Scar is chased away, rains begin, their homeland will become restored to its former glory, with Simba as king!

Everything in this film is near perfection in execution,and is flawless when hitting beats of emotion. This is a movie that has it all, a great cast, flawless music, as well as fantastic story. I strongly erge everyone to see this in theaters when it plays, if not only to simply support this master piece. No matter what mood you are in I guarantee enjoyment from this picture. 10/10

                                                    Quick warning: This review DOES contain some minor spoilers like plot elements, but there's nothing too major and I'm sure most of you reading this have already seen the movie.Many people consider Disney's The Lion King to be one of their greatest films ever made, often praising the emotions, the character development, the humor, and the musical aspects. These much-praised aspects of the film are indeed worthy to be titled one of the best by Disney.What's the story? A lion cub crowned prince is tricked by a treacherous uncle into thinking he caused his father's death and flees into exile in despair, only to learn in adulthood his identity and his responsibilities.There are many great things to say about this movie, but without a doubt the best aspect of the whole movie is the animation. The way it breathes fresh air onto the environments, the designs of the animals, as well as having tons of color and energy, is very well done, and renders beautifully onto the screen. It's certainly one of the best looking Disney movies of all time. Another great thing about this movie is that the emotion is played very well. Unlike some other emotional films like The Good Dinosaur, the emotional scenes are appropriately emotional and they don't overdo anything on a sad scene. The reason why Mufasa's death is considered one of the most heartbreaking scenes in cinema history is because they play the emotion on very well, and they don't go absolutely crazy on making it sad. The musical numbers are not just catchy and timeless, they're examples of what Disney can do by taking a simple plot and turning it into a revolutionary musical. Many of the songs, like The Circle of Life and Hakuna Matata are well known by pretty much everyone. The only criticism I have to give is that sometimes it skips over some important plot elements, making some scenes feel either a bit rushed, or dragged on just to hit the film's 88 minute runtime. Fortunately, those scenes are uncommon, and the rest of the movie is fantastic for the most part.In conclusion, The Lion King is a powerful and uplifting Disney story that continues to be one of Disney's most iconic and exemplary films ever made. No matter what upcoming releases Disney pushes out, this film will always be remembered for an eternity.

younger viewers, I guess I was expecting something a little more epic. Not that I was particularly disappointed, I suppose all those rave reviews I read maybe upped my expectations a tad. At the end of the day it does what it says on the tin and you really cannot ask for more. It does stand out as one of the better Disney animated films its era, that's a given, but I must say I have seen later films that are equally as good, or even better. Even so, it will still delight, amuse and entertain and I cannot knock it for that\u0085 Recommended.My score: 8.2/10.IMDb Score: 8.3/10 (based on 220,746 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 89/100 (based on 92 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 89/100 (based on 1,177,009 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

actually watched the entire thing. Inescapably I've seen most of this movie through memes, social media and what not, you can't really dodge it for that long. But short clips or images only tell half the story. And for a first time viewing the Lion King was a great experience (as expected).First and foremost, the opening sequence, utterly stunning and engaging and just so immersive. It just grabs you instantly and puts you in that world. No other movie I've seen latently really gets you that fast. Disney is the best at it though with their animated movie. It's such a grand opening. Combine that with the music.. perfect. And it doesn't surprise me that this movie worked so well, names as Hans Zimmer, Elton John, James earl jones and many more, big names and iconic voices. There's a perfect mix here for a great movie.Lion King does exactly what it needs to do as a story. Combine that with the voice acting, animation quality and music and you get a fantastic movie.Contrary to some other Disney movies from this era the Lion King finally does a finale justice. Where the fight doesn't feel simplified and cut off (Aladdin). Simba and Scar's fight feels so much better and they actually took the time for it making it so much more satisfying.Music, well some iconic ones that I've heard countless times before so the big impact has lessend but I still recognize them as incredible sections. I focused more on the visuals with just went up a level during these moments which I loved.Overall just really good. Disney at their peak again.

                                                              In 1989 Disney released The Little Mermaid and reinvented it's animation department. The peak of that reinvention seemed to end with Aladdin. But then in 1994 they released the highest grossing and most commercially successful animated film of that time. I have seen Beauty And The Beast, Aladdin, and Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. This one leaves them all in the dust. I first saw it in theaters at the age of six. My uncle whom I was extremely close to died a couple months before the movie came out. I had to be taken out of the theater. It took me six years before I was able to watch it without breaking down at Mufasa's death scene. Now I simply break down and cry throughout the rest of the movie. The film is incredibly deep, has an all star voice cast, and blends splendid animation with Oscar winning songs and compulsive storyline. You can't help but enjoy it.

The old times, then everything around was new and unfamiliar. And now I clearly remember, how I first saw it on VHS and was really impressed with whole magic Disney had created. Even today I think very well of this movie and recommend it to my friends, no matter how old they are. Few days ago I watched this movie again with my friends, although it was digitally remastered. Sure thing I wanted to see the classic version but nevertheless I enjoyed it very much. And so did my friends, They also agreed with me, what nowadays movies can't compare with old Disney's classics and I hope, that people won't forget them. It would be a great fun if all these characters as Simba from my long beloved Liong Kinng or Little Marmaid Ariel once again would be popular and famous as they were long ago.

                         Even at the age of 31,, this Disney movie is just the closest thing to my heart.. as a child I never understood why it attracted me so much but as a grown up & after losing my own father... every word in this movie seems to be written for me. So intense & heart warming at the same time spiritual ... love it

It deals with love, trust, betrayal, respect, death, fun and friendship in a way that kids understand.Apart from the movie itself, The Lion King has a wonderful soundtrack, with songs like Hakuna Matata, The Cirlce Of Life and Can You Feel The Love Tonight. This movie has been setting record numbers for box-office sales and merchandising revenue around the world, and inspiring thousands of fans to build on its story with their own creativity.After you and/or your children have seen the Lion King and enjoyed it you might want to watch some more good animation movies also by Walt Disney, so I made a list of quality animation movies for you: "Jungle Book", "Snow white and the seven dwarfs", "Alice in Wonderland", "Aladdin", "Bambi", "The beauty and the beast", "Pinocchio", "The hunchback of the Notre Dame"And some of the very latest animation movies "Ice Age", "The Incredibles" (made by computer) Finding Nemo (idem) and last but not least "shrek" 1 and 2

                                                    'The Lion King' was The Greatest Film, I had watched as a child. I was a school student when this film released, it was 1994. I remember watching this Masterstroke daily after returning from school. 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight' became an anthem for me, and till today it remains as one of my all-time favorites. Directors Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff and Writers Written by Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts & Linda Woolverton deserve an ovation for making something so magical as 'The Lion King'. The screenplay that talks about pride, honor and loss leaves you haunted. It's a beautiful film, a completely well-balanced film, that makes you laugh and cry at the correct time. 'The Lion King' has a legendary soundtrack attached to it, as well. 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight', not only became an anthem for me, but also for the world once upon a time. It won the Golden-Globe Award and the Academy-Award for Original Song, which only elevated it's anyways going-to-happen legendary following.The characters, be it Simba, Scar or anyone... each character has an ark, and all the characters have been voiced wonderfully by well-known Hollywood Names. On the whole, For those who haven't seen 'The Lion King': Take out time from other non-sense and watch this milestone. Two Big Thumbs Up!!

Frog. This movie was released during, I would say, Disney's golden age of movies when Aladdin, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Pocahontas were made. While Mickey Mouse will always be Disney's flagship character, the princesses from these movies laid the ground work for what we know Disneyland to be today. I believe that the animals in the movies also offer a certain mysticism that contributes to the magic of what Disney and Disneyland is today. And like many other cartoon Disney movies, Lion King is a classic because of the plot, songs, and the art work. I would definitely recommend any child to see Lion King because it is always fun seeing a movie and then visiting the theme park where all your favorite characters live.

Too broadway for my taste. Just not sure why this gets so much praise. It totally lacks the magic old Disney films had.Just when something decent started they jumped into a dance and a song. Not much of a fan of musicals, so this didn't help.Why does one lion speak with an American accent but his brother (scar) with an English one? Did they not spend two seconds thinking about these things? All the voices were done so woodenly. Did they just read off a paper without any natural delivery. Because of the bad acting and it just didn't connect on a real BELIEVABLE emotional level. Whenever you see (hear in this case) bad acting it almost becomes a joke.There was just a lack of story and character development. It. It went too quick into the conflict between the two lion brothers and then it seemed non-stop trying to kill Simba and the King. The story was just the wrong one, OR, it was just poorly structured and executed. They should have started it with Simba and his friendship and follow him as he learns the ways of the jungle. Instead we got 40 minutes of them trying to kill him before we even get some remotely interesting.Just because it's animation doesn't mean you need to throw out basic story telling. This was just too simple and not in a good way, but in a hollow way.The amount of praise this has gotten is a reflection of how little it takes to impress people.

This movie uses slapstick and other juvenille tricks for the humor. This movie is aimed at little kids. I hate this movie and I always will. Damn the lion king ! Damn it to hell!



I'm just going to come right out and say it, I think this is "Sensational"! I grew up in the 2nd Golden Disney era, and while the other films were brilliant, The Lion King was the one that always stood out. It's profound coming-of-age story has filled me with joy and heartache. In fact the older I become, the more I can appreciate the art, script, and journey the filmmakers went through.The aspects of this films are excellent as far as I'm concerned. I'll start with the animation. It's stunning! The artists and animators alike went the full nine yards to grab the audience's imagination and put them on Safari ride. It's precision as well as colorful nature has turned the savanna into a combination of a documentary and fantasy.The music is a blast to listen to! Elton John & Tim Rice were right on the money. They combine elements of pop-show-tunes and moving ballads, so it remains catchy, fresh, easy, and moving all at the same time. The score by Hans Zimmer has been nothing short of splendid. It captures the essence within the first five minutes. The power and majesty of the score awakens the senses and even heart. And credit should absolutely be given to Lebo M for providing the culture and spirit of South Africa. Sirli all these very different of equally talented men into one project and you have something magnificent.And finally- what a remarkable cast! If it hadn't been for these fantastic men & women, we wouldn't have the characters with the same amount of depth or hysteria. Each actor borough a critical but top notch performance. And a standing ovation to them should be given. James Earl Jones, Jermy Irons, Matthew Broderict, Johnathan Taylor Thomas, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Rowan Atkins, Moria Kelley, Robert Guillume, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings should all be immensely proud to have been apart of this project.All in all this film couldn't be anymore entertaining to me. Filled with drama,laughter,suspense,adventure,romance and tragedy. It's become one of the most beloved and acclaimed thematic experiences. And it thrills me to know people around the world continue to celebrate it.

I'm 32 now...In all honesty, the world has changed a lot since -94. In life and in the world we all live in. I wouldn't say that I'm worried about the future. But I think we all feel the ground shaking beneath us....The projector started rolling and "The Lion King" came on the big screen. ..From the very first scene, I was BLOWN away! - The Music! - The Colors! - The Characters! - The Voices! - The Story Line, Drama and Comedy!In this adventure, EVERYTHINIG comes together so amazingly perfect. It made me "choke up" for the first time, it made me laugh out really loud, I was captured from the first frame to the last."The Lion King" is arguably the best animated feature film to date. The film is flawless, an absolute masterpiece in animation. It deals with great loss, hope, friendship, love, and despair. It strokes every emotional string you have! Trust me. This is truly a film for everyone! Your age, gender, what country you're from, or currently live in is irrelevant. This film will capture you in ways that will make you remember what being human is, and will leave you with that extra special feeling that if experiences like this exists? Maybe things are going to be alright after all. 😊My dear friends!This is a film you shouldn't miss! It is a TRUE masterpiece in every aspect! Let these 1,5 hours be part of your life!
