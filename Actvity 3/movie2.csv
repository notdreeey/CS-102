"kosmasp","31 May 2015","A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ...","

"Jared_Andrews","13 April 2016","Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, ""we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.","

"aheaven2005","25 June 2022","A science-fiction masterpiece. Nolan executes a marvelous direction that slowly but efficiently puts in place a dark world creating a necessity to save humanity. Add to that great performances from Nolan and Hathaway plus a great score from Hans Zimmer. The result is on the best science-fiction movies of all time.","

"theoledoux","6 April 2021","I think just about everything has been said about this film now. But, I can still tell you what this masterpiece is to me. To me, this movie is possibly the most relevant movie ever, because it questions our own humanity relative to the Universe. Whether that's our ability to love, think, or persevere and walk into the unknown. We are explorers, and curious at heart. This untameable curiosity is not our end, but our beginning. It is what advanced this civilization and it will continue to do so. So never, never let anybody tell you that we shouldn't look towards the stars and wonder, because that's what makes us human. Without this stargazing we are merely animals, accepting our fate in the dust...","

Just to feel that thing, I only get from this movie. That the earth, space and time are something special, mystical. I never forget the first time I saw this movie, in an IMAX theatre in 2014. I was struck by it. Totally got me. And it stil does, 7 years later. This is the best movie ever made for me. Because of the feeling it gives me, no other movie can. So hard to get all of this emotion in only one movie. Brilliant.","

"Tweekums","27 January 2016","Set in a future where crop species are going extinct one after another former test pilot Joseph Cooper is now a farmer growing corn. His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship. Time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the black hole; this means that as hours pass for Cooper years are passing back on Earth.This film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened to the Earth before getting the mission to save the world started; this means the separation of Cooper and Murphey is more emotional. Once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension, including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they visit. The small cast does a fine job; especially Matthew McConaughey, who plays Cooper; Anne Hathaway, who plays Amelia Brand a scientist aboard the mission; and Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain, who play the younger and older Murphey. The effects looked great, as one would expect in a film from Christopher Nolan, and I was pleased that space was depicted as silent; something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive. Things do get a little confusing near the end but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing frustration.Overall I'd recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science fiction in the mould of '2001 – A Space Odyssey' although this has more emotion to it than that classic.","

"frank-ancestor-hunter","6 April 2015","I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn movie was so riveting if there were any I didn't notice them!","

"gavin6942","25 January 2015","A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival.Going into this I had mixed feelings because some have praised it, others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. There were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. Then, when we get to the Oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.This was wrong. Maybe this is not the best role from Matthew McConaughey or Anne Hathaway. Though, the fact that a ""Hathaway hater"" like myself enjoyed it should say something. And I think Jessica Chastain should have received a Best Supporting nomination. She easily outshines Laura Dern in ""Wild"".This may be the greatest ever film about physics.","

"zardoz-13","25 November 2014","Hollywood science fiction spectacles about antagonistic aliens abandoning dying worlds to occupy not only Earth, but also to oust us have been popular with moviegoers. Typically, like the European explorers who invaded and disenfranchised millions in the Western Hemisphere during the 15th century, these extraterrestrials—either bug-eyed behemoths with lobster claws or pod people whose seeds have drifted across the cosmos—show up to evict or absorb us. ""Inception"" director Christopher Nolan's latest extravaganza ""Interstellar,"" toplining Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow, is a superior space opera that reverses the action. Earthlings must abandon mother Earth because an environmental blight has devastated farming and millions have starved to death in overpopulated continents. No, ""Interstellar"" doesn't pit Earth against multi-colored ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" aliens or immaculate looking storm troopers in white outfits from the ""Star Wars"" and ""Hunger Games"" franchises. Instead, the ""Interstellar"" scientist heroes must search for a new home for humankind. Rather than an outlandish adventure epic with evil extraterrestrials, ""Interstellar"" qualifies as an intelligent, realistic, sometimes provocative, sci-fi saga similar to Stanley Kubrick's landmark movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Mind you, Nolan doesn't chronicle mankind's evolution from the dawn of time the way Kubrick did in as ""2001."" The casts of ""Interstellar"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" differ, too. Kubrick relied on an unknown cast, while ""Interstellar"" boasts a charismatic array of superstars. If you haven't seen ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" you won't appreciate some of the clever allusions to the legendary 1968 film. Anybody who has seen ""2001"" will be amused by a joke that a robot makes about blowing an astronaut out of an airlock. Ultimately, the most obvious ""2001"" references in ""Interstellar"" are those bizarre, oblong, Minecraft-style robots that resemble the black monoliths in Kubrick's film. Some of the sci-fi terminology may fly over your head, but Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan concern themselves with more than speculative science fiction ideas. They focus on relevant contemporary themes, such as father & daughter relationships and the environment. They forge interesting characters with philosophical dialogue that you will ponder long after the movie. ""Interstellar"" occurs in the late 21st century, after things have waxed really wretched. Bad enough that farmers can grow only corn. Blight has destroyed wheat and okra. Public opinion about NASA has curdled. History textbooks have been rewritten. Everybody believes NASA faked the Apollo moon landings to bankrupt the Soviet Union. A former NASA test pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey of ""Mud""), has turned to farming and reaped rewards where many others have failed. Although his wife died from a brain cyst that an MRI could have detected had an MRI had been available, Cooper perseveres as a farmer and a father of two children, his fifteen-year old son Tom (Timothée Chalamet of ""Worse Friends""), and his precious ten-year old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy of ""The Conjuring"") who adore him. Cooper and his kids live with his father-in-law, Donald (John Lithgow of ""Terms of Endearment""), and they contend with tumultuous dust storms on a daily basis. These dust storms recall the Depression Era drought and dust storms of that prompted millions to flee from the plains states. Dust gets into everything, and Donald wages a never-ending war to keep everything clean. Meanwhile, books have been toppling randomly from Murph's bedroom bookcase. She suspects a ghost is responsible, but nothing ghoulish like ""Paranormal Activity."" Naturally, Cooper dismisses the presence of ghosts. One day after a particularly turbulent dust storm, father and daughter examine the way the books have fallen out of the shelves, translate it into code, and come up with coordinates that lead them to a classified NORAD facility. A monolithic robot named Tars confronts them. Later, Murph and Cooper find themselves sitting around a table talking with high-ranking NASA officials. One of them is Professor Brand (Michael Caine of ""Batman Begins""), and Brand confides in Cooper that the world is living on borrowed time. Moreover, he tells him about the 'Lazarus' project. NASA has dispatched manned missions to other parts of the galaxy to find a new home for mankind. He convinces Cooper to sign on as a pilot for one last launch that will take his daughter, biologist Amelia (Oscar winning actress Anne Hathaway of ""Les Misérables); physicist Romilly (David Gyasi); geographer Doyle (Wes Bentley of ""The Hunger Games""); and two robots TARS (voice of Bill Irwin) and CASE (voice of Josh Stewart) deep into space to a recently discovered wormhole which will enable them to explore new worlds. Predictably, Murph isn't happy about her father's departure. During their flight to the wormhole, Cooper and company lose contact with Earth, but Professor Brand can still transmit messages. Gradually, however, things take a turn for the worst. The final quarter hour of ""Interstellar"" will absolutely boggle your mind. Cooper goes where no man has gone before in a desperate bid to save mankind! ""Interstellar"" is a serious sci-fi movie. The computer-generated visual effects are nothing short of dazzling, and Nolan orchestrates the flight sequences so we don't hear any sounds in the vacuum of outer space. The different spacecraft and the Endurance mother ship look as authentic as the outfits that our heroes wear. The strange but new worlds that they encounter during their search to locate a new Earth are breathtaking. One world consists of an eternal sea with towering waves that loom like mountain ranges, while another is as stark and icy as it is inhospitable. The theme of deception runs throughout ""Interstellar."" The faked Apollo moon landing and Dr. Brand's mind-blowing revelation are a few surprises that will maintain your interest throughout ""Interstellar."" Nolan generates several suspenseful set-pieces that will keep you poised on the edge of your seat. Matt Damon has a startling cameo as another astronaut who has succumbed to effects of isolation. Clocking in at 169 minutes, ""Interstellar"" amounts to an unforgettable epic with intense white-knuckled suspense, top-notch performances, and a terrific ending.","

"FeastMode","1 July 2019","I rate this movie 11/10 to signify it's greatness. Perfection. Mind-blowing. A workout for your brain. I want to have debates about it. I want to write research papers on it. Amazingly unbelievably awesome. This is the kind of movie that opens up your mind. Lots of amazing scenes with epic music. A killer story told flawlessly. Perfect directing by the best ever. Great cast with great acting. A deep psychological aspect explored for numerous characters.The most renowned theoretical physicist who is an expert on cosmology was brought on to keep the science honest, as well as a retired astronaut who's been to space five times. One of the rare movies that is better the second, and even the third time watching. The only movie I have ever liked the most the fourth time. I keep picking up on more things and a better overall understanding. So many parts are extremely moving and powerful. It does an awesome job of making you feel what the characters are feeling.EDIT on tenth viewing: This movie destroys me every time. Numerous tears EVERY TIME. And I don't just mean at the obvious emotional parts. There are so many moments where I am in complete awe at the beauty of the filmmaking I'm experiencing, to the point of tears. The way the story all comes together and the ""epiphany moment"" is so perfect that it brings me to tears.When watching movies, I sometimes think, ""this is the best thing I've ever seen"" or ""this is the coolest thing I've ever seen."" I know it's hyperbole and I've said it many times, usually at one or maybe two scenes in a movie. During Interstellar, I feel this way for about 40% of this three hour movie. Every time I watch, it re-emphasizes that it is CLEARY my favorite movie of all-time. And that musical score alone gives me goosebumps for so much of the movie. Hans is the GOAT. Nolan is the GOAT.(10 viewings, 12/2/2016, 2/26/2020, 1/11/2022, 8/9/2023)SPOILERSI was randomly thinking about Interstellar, haven't watched it in at least 6 months. I thought about one hypothetical that intrigued me: what if the tesseract is such that it can only be placed inside an already collapsed black hole. If plan B was what ""originally"" happened and Dr. Brand survived, future people figured it out, and they want to save those they left behind on earth, they need to find a love-link between someone who goes into a black hole and someone on earth smart enough to be able to solve the gravity problem = Cooper and Murph. Doctor Brand knows this because she knows Cooper loves Murph, knows he sacrifices himself by falling into the black hole, knows Murph grows up to be her dad's understudy, so she has the future people (eventually, after her death) put the machine in the same black hole that Cooper falls into, thereby making the entire plan work. INTRIGUING. Will need to confirm on next viewing... after watching again, I like this as a viable theory, but it conflicts with another theory I had about the ""original"" mission being completed without Cooper.Lots of awesome concepts that made me think, like Murphy's Law not applying close to a black hole, human survival instincts and it encompassing your children, love being a quantifiable scientific force, the black hole and time relativity. The robots are cool and original. Really awesome visuals of things I've wondered about but never really imagined. I liked the depiction of the 5 dimensions in 3D in the daughter's room. The way everything connected is very awesome. The different planets are so interesting with ice clouds and giant tidal waves. The endings are perfect.Something I noticed that I didn't realize the first time is the reason his son became dark and a little crazy. He was still a good person, even after experiencing the death of his son, Jesse. However, once his wife convinced him to let go of the idea that his father was coming back, he gave up on everything in life and became a horrible husband, father and brother.The relationship between Coop and Murph is the best relationship I can remember in any movie I've seen. The primary underlying theme in the movie is the love between a father and his daughter being able to transcend space and time, which is the key to her getting the information she needs to save the world.From Interstellar group chat discussion:-Or the other theory I had was that originally plan B was the one that worked and a colony survived and eventually was able to do what they did and wanted to save all the people that ended up dying on earth and try to make plan A work-So she finds out that plan a was a sham. That the professor had already solved the equation years ago before she even met him. That he knew even with solving the equation that they couldn't figure out how to get the people off earth. She found out they knew they were never coming back and they were going to let everyone on earth to die. So every day since she was 10 that she has been hoping her father would come home was a lie. She should have never been hoping. Her entire 20 years that she dedicated her life to working on this was a complete waste. That should break a person. Murph is a beast.-The love between them was the only reason the world ended up being saved. It's the only reason she kept trying that hard after all those years. It's the only reason she went back to her house in her room. It's the only reason she saw the watch again. It's the only reason she figured out that the watch twitching was her dad sending the data.12/2/16: I watched interstellar again wow. I found a flaw in my theory that in the original timeline they used Plan B without Cooper, and then when they became advanced they went back to try to get Cooper so they could save the people that died on earth. The problem is, how would they have gotten past the problems with re-docking onto the spinning blown up ship after Mann backstabbed humanity. But it actually makes perfect sense because in the original timeline Cooper would not have convinced them to go to Mann's planet, Brand would have convinced them to go to Edmund's planet which was the right one. In that ""original"" timeline, love still saved humanity since it helped her choose the right planet.","

"CalRhys","8 November 2014","I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema.","

"slayerjmk95","3 November 2014","(This is both a review of the film, and an assertion of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style)There have been many reviewers and critics alike that have high praise for the film (the visual effects, the acting, the music), but say how it's not Christopher Nolan's best directed film. This is where i personally would have to disagree. Before i get into it, though, i'll talk about Interstellar a bit.Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.Now, about Mr. Nolan. Don't just look at Nolan, but look at his films. Some say Inception would be his masterpiece, while others would say it's The Dark Knight, or Memento. But honestly, every single film Christopher Nolan has directed is a masterpiece not of its genre, but of Nolan. Following is his quiet masterpiece, not the film that put Mr. Nolan on the map as a phenomenal director, but one people visited or revisited after becoming accustomed to Nolan, after seeing Memento, what could be called his breakout masterpiece. Then, right after, he directed the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia. This, too, could be considered a masterpiece, even if a remake. Then, we were given his take on the Batman universe, starting with Batman Begins, the origin masterpiece. Then, there's The Prestige, adapted from the novel of the same name, which can be called his dark masterpiece. The Dark Knight, his bold masterpiece; Inception, his complex masterpiece, and The Dark Knight Rises, his flawed masterpiece. Now, we have Interstellar, his emotional or personal masterpiece.This is just my looking at Nolan and his films, but whatever your thoughts are, you can't deny Interstellar is one hell of a journey. He certainly is one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all time. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar.","

"tardieu-felix","1 November 2014","The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar. Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded. I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push ! ""*you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out.Félix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014","

"lark40","13 November 2014","chris Nolan a delivered another original story with with less special effects its more old school stuff with flight simulators done instead of geeen screens with space painted on the outside everything you see in this movie is real as your going to get so here starts the story of a farmer called cooper played by Matthew mconnaughey another Oscar performance who was a N.A.S.A pilot and his family he finds out that there is a problem with earth food sources and stumbles upon a plan to save earth and t leave earth for another world with his daughter he loves and his daughter tuned into other worldly scientific things that I wont explain you have to see this to understand the films relevance on finding a solution to the worlds problems there is a solution in here house were signs are there but I wont make sense until the end he has really turned the corner in his career what a RenascenceFirst of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of contact and parts of inception you see in this movie ca feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. you think how loud this film is you think you ware a astronautMatthew, In this movie... Well, he is the movie. he orchestrates this film that everybody else feeds of his power so much that everyone around him gets better. But Matthew is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest who is mischievous in a minor role , is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. and a sarcastic computer really a bit bizarre in space but this computer does come in handy in a important scene And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with this movie. And we can feel and see just as Spielberg did in the 80s Nolan is doing it now Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.whole journey that they thought was fraught with danger and the unknown as they have received messages from across time and space to realize that they had the answers after all it was just his daughter love to figure out what the lead scientist life work (Michael Caine) was about My rating for this movie can only be a 10,this film does not feel like 3hrs of moving space enthralling epic masterpiece with a beating heart of love and time and bending space time from a to b to meet his family across the universe This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made.if you like thinking about logic you might just come way thinking that this earth can be saved if we take what Nolan was taking about and not just taking the earth for granted Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night... Rage, Rage Against The Dying Of The Light.""","

"Horst_In_Translation","25 December 2014","To this day , many people still talk a lot about Christopher Nolan's ""Batman""-trilogy, but here is his newest work: ""Interstellar"". He gets help from Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. One year after Cuarón with Gravity, he discovers the endless widths of space as well. The difference, however is that a large part of his movie, including the first 40 minutes or so completely, plays down on Planet Earth. However, it is also about survival in space, including two people instead of one though. Or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate.This is like our generation's ""Armageddon"", only that it is much better and much more edge-of-the-seat. The lead character is played by Matthew McConaughey, whose career is still on a massive high after numerous critically lauded performances and an Academy Award win. ""Interstellar"" is much more than Sci-Fi though. I personally found the film was at its best when it touched more the emotional relationships of the characters. The water planet sequence was incredibly well done. And right afterward, when Cooper (McConaughey) sees how his beloved family has aged and become parents, it is truly moving as well. I had a lump in my throat just like I did when he meets his very old daughter at the end of the movie. The inclusions with the old people telling about the past seem a bit odd at first, but make sense towards the end as we find out who is speaking there really.Then, I also had a love-hate relationship with the Matt Damon parts. I found it pretty boring to be honest initially, but when we found out about his true intentions, it quickly turns into one of the best parts of the film. Nicely done. When Caine's character mentioned him with high praise early on, I felt there could be something fishy (like with Pixar's Up) there and yes it was. The ending of the movie with Hathaway's character completely alone out there made me think maybe there will be a sequel. Saving Private... ehh I mean Dr. Brand. Who knows? The time during which the whole film plays is also interesting. Somehow, the NASA lost a lot of their reputation and the moon landing is called fake in American school books. It is some point in the future. That much we know. David Oyelowo plays a small role here as one of the teachers. He has ""Selma"" in the race for an Academy Award nomination this year.The ending of the film was not among the best scenes in my opinion, but I still liked it. The whole ghost explanation about Cooper being actually the one giving the signs was pretty exciting. The effects are brilliant of course, but that does not really need be mentioned for Nolan movies. A given. Hans Zimmer did a good soundtrack and there is also some comic relief coming from McConaughey's charm (if you like that) and some droll robot creatures. Anyway, I found the film interesting enough that I found it a bit sad they did not get to visit the third planet (with Hathaway's character's lover), only the water planet and the ice planet. I'd have loved to see that. However, maybe that could be a nice inclusion for a sequel as well. The movie never dragged despite coming pretty close to the three-hour mark. It could have run for another hour and I probably would not have been bored. There really was hardly anything wrong with it. Affleck's character did not do too much for me. He wasn't particularly well-acted and the character felt just included as a simple man who quickly gave up on his dad in order to show the contrast compared to Chastain's character: the ambitious loving smart daughter with a true connection to Cooper. John Lithgow plays a small role too and is fun to watch as always.This is one of the movies I really recommend to watch, preferably on the big screen due to its sensational visual aspects. It's also good for a rewatch I believe, also to evaluate the characters' actions, especially Caine's for example. And the story of course. I believe, after one viewing, I am still far away from having understood everything that was going on, especially the scientific aspects. That however, does not hurt the viewing experience at all thanks to the film's great acting and emotional impact. If you are interested in space, you really have to see this too. It has distant planets, wormholes, black holes, spaceships and a lot more. Let me finish this review with two little snippets: First, the actress who played Murph as a child was the same that played Renesmee in the last two Twilight movies and, secondly, that fittingly Hathaway's character was called Amelia like the aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart. That can't be coincidence, can it? Especially with her last shot.","

"EVON1TY","13 March 2023","The key of this movie may feel like you're watching only a Science-Fiction movie. Most of the times Sci-Fi movies are not great at telling an effective, emotional drama stories. You can't find this type of movie easily, unless you are watching a Sci-Fi movie directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Jonathan Nolan.Mixing those two genres is unique and dangerous. All the Nolan's projects are a bit dangerous and special.Not only the storyline is so great but also nearly all other technical details are great!Brilliant scores that composed by Hans Zimmer.The film editing is just beyond perfect. One of the best film editings of all time.The Cinematography by Wally Pfister is quite realistic and charming.The VFX are just stunning. Even the scientist are amazed by how great it is.Some of the people thinks this movie is based on wrong theories, so that makes it a bad movie. As you may know, all the movies are based on wrong things. You are watching a Sci-Fi movie. In being realistic, Sci-Fi movies are just one step ahead of Fantasy. Why would you look for reality in this movies? It's not a crime movie. If people would demand realistic movies, there would be a bigger Documentary sector.The main reason why people think like that is this movie is not only based on wrong theories. It's mixed. Some of the theories are proven, some of them has potential to be true, some of them are not likely true.But you can't make a movie that reflects so effective storyline with only the truth. Even ""Based on A True Story"" movies are so changed to make it more effective. You can't name any Sci-Fi movie that based on all true theories. Other Sci-Fi movies are not explaining the questions at all. And somehow when this movie tries to explain, this movie becames faulty. So better not trying to explain what's going on? In this movie there is no major flaw that you can't ignore. The main story is just so effective and perfect.","

"Patterson13","8 April 2015","This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100.","

"bob-the-movie-man","12 November 2014","Wowser! This Christopher Nolan film was presaged with such marketing hype that I went in with pretty low and cynical expectations. But I was frankly blown away with it.Just about everyone raves about Christopher Nolan's work, and you look back at his Filmography and it makes for a pretty impressive resume: from Memento via the (rather over-hyped imho) Dark Knight Batman series-reboot through to Inception, one of my favourite films of all time. For me, Interstellar is right up there with Inception for thought-provoking, visually spectacular and truly epic cinema.We start in familiar 'Day after Tomorrow"" territory, with mankind having in some way – not entirely explained – messed up the planet. As I understood it (and the film probably does require multiple watches with – see comments below – subtitles=on) the rather clever premise is that the world's food supplies are being progressively destroyed by a vindictive 'blight'. This delivers the double whammy of destroying mankind's provisions but also, by massive reproduction of the organism, progressively depleting the Earth's oxygen. For some reason – again, which I didn't get on first viewing – this is accompanied by massive dust storms. It is a morbid bet as to what is going to get the mid-West population first: starvation, lung disease or suffocation. Matthew McConnaughey plays the widowed Cooper, an ex-NASA drop out turned farmer given the opportunity by mission-leader Professor Brand (an excellent Michael Caine) to pilot a NASA mission. The goal is to punch through a mysterious wormhole in space where they suspect, through previous work, that a new home for mankind could be found.The first part of the film is set on and around Cooper's farm, setting in place one of the emotional wrenches at the heart of the film: that Cooper in volunteering for the mission and having to leave behind his elderly father (John Lithgow, again superb) and young children Murph (aged 10) and Tom (aged 15) whilst recognising that danger for him comes not just from the inherent risks involved but from the theory of relativity that could change everything, time-wise, for when he returns.Cooper is supported on the mission by a team of scientists including Brand's daughter played by a love-struck Anne Hathaway, who again shows she can act.To say any more would spoil what is a voyage of visual and mental discovery. (However, I would add that it is good to see that the character that plays my namesake Dr Mann (in a surprise cameo) is equally good looking! LOL).In terms of plus points, where do I start? The visuals are utterly stunning. Whilst reminiscent in places of Kubrick's ""stargate"" from 2001, the similarity is only passing. The film adds a majesty and scale to space that surpasses wonder. Elsewhere there are some interesting visual effects: this might have just been me of course, but after the dramatic launch there was something about the camera moves during the first scenes of weightlessness that made me feel genuinely nauseous.Equally stunning is Hans Zimmer's score which is epic and (in places) very VERY loud. The film certainly doesn't ""go quietly into the night""! When matching the noise of the score/choir to the sound effects in the launch sequence the combination is ear-bleedingly effective. This must be a strong contender for the soundtrack Oscar for 2014. One quibble, again 2001 related, is that Zimmer uses the last chord of Also Sprach Zarathustra in the score sufficiently often that one hopes Richard Strauss's estate receives some royalties! The acting is top notch: I've already mentioned Caine and Lithgow, but McConnaughey, Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are all great. A particular shout-out should go to Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph, who is magnetically charismatic and just brilliant in the role.Above all, Nolan's direction is exquisite. The film has a slow build on earth (which adds to the lengthy running time) but defines the characters and primes the plot perfectly. And some of the editing cuts – again, Cooper's farm departure/launch sequence overlay is a great example – are superb in building the mood and the tension.I've decided that I am an extremely tough reviewer and for me a 10 star film is a rarity indeed. Where I could have knocked off a star was in some of the dialogue on the soundtrack, which was pretty inaudible in places: McConnaughey in particular with his general mumbling and strong southern accent is indecipherable in places. I look forward to the DVD subtitles. And one of the character's dying words – delivering a key plot point in the film – was completely lost to me (but thankfully later restated). Whilst the expansive plot is highly ambitious, the end of the film, playing fast and loose with physics I fear, requires a gravity-defying suspension of belief (although I guess the same could equally be said of 2001: A Space Odyssey).However, the film has stayed so firmly lodged in my mind for 24 hours I will make a rare exception to my rating 'rule'. Overall, this is a top-notch Sci-Fi film. And a final word: PEOPLE THIS IS A MUST SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN!

"christopher-stiedl","14 December 2015","Interstellar - ReviewCertain things in life are precious. Very precious. And so was the Film for me.Why you might ask?Well seldom do i get the chance where i find myself sitting in a cinema anxious and intrigued by what might come. In a time where trailers are omnipresent and going to the movies without having seen one seems unreasonable, outright stupid to some i had the magical chance to find myself in front of the IMAX on a cold November night with 2 tickets to Interstellar. My only knowledge was that Nolan directed it and McConaughey stars in it.The images were brilliant the acting was top notch and everything was blended together by Hans Zimmer and his Music. 169 minutes flew by me with my eyes fixed on the screen and my heart racing. And there it was.. The ending. I couldn't believe it . I was reliving, rethinking the movie while the credit scenes rolled enjoying the moment, the smell of popcorn, my comfortable seat and what do i see next to me? Ninety percent of the people in the cinema rushing outside after the first second of the credit scenes. .. .Well apparently people enjoy movies different than i do. Maybe i should start watching trailers again :).","

"tavm","1 December 2014","Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think.","

"Gordon-11","6 November 2014","This film tells the story of an ex-pilot in a world full of dust storms. He is chosen to travel to the uncharted parts of the space in search for a new habitable planet.""Interstellar"" is a long film, and the first two hours of it does not seem like a typical Christopher Nolan film. Most of the scenes are (literally) down to Earth, with no fancy visual effects. It spends much time building up the story, telling the story of a father and his daughter who sees 'ghost' in her bedroom. Through this ghost, one thing led to another, and the man is in space. When the film is not down on Earth, it looks more like a disaster film. The first adventure is a spectacular feat involving water. It also introduces the physics of relativity, on how time slows down in another world, leading to a misguided decision of the astronauts in retrospect. This sets the foundation for future plot involving more relativity.As the film progresses, there is more adventure, both in the form of adrenaline pumping adventure and humanity and integrity testing conditions. Matt Damon's character forms a central subplot that makes me reflect on what lengths would people go in order to achieve a certain goal. It reflects on the reality that people are driven by egocentric instincts. It is not a pretty truth, but it tells that human are not idealistic creatures.The final half an hour is what a typical Christopher Nolan film is like. It makes me hold my breath because it is so intense, both emotionally and cognitively. The ending gives me inexplicable exhilaration. Things come to a full circle, and it is filled with joy.It is not a film for everyone, as the story is long and takes a lot of time to build. Two people walked out of the cinema an hour into the film, and someone sitting behind me remarked after the film ended that he opined it was the most boring Christopher Nolan film ever. For me, I enjoyed ""Interstellar"" thoroughly, because it is emotionally captivating and intellectually challenging.","

"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","3 April 2015","A lot has been said and heard about this movie but none of it comes even close to the experience of watching it. It has all the elements of a Nolan movie and just like in all of his other movies he decides to go a bit further. This time, he went a little too far. The story behind the movie has it's flaws. There really is no explanation of what happened/is happening. Instead you are given fragments in the first half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together. All in all, the first part seems a bit rushed and leaves you wondering if more could have been told. But, since the real story is not why the travel is necessary but the travel itself once the crew is off, the story really kicks in. The main part of the movie gives a great ride, pumps your blood with adrenaline from time to time and gets you emotional pretty often. The problem I personally had was that the story taking place simultaneously on Earth was less shown than I expected. A different approach was expected but that did not stop Chastain from giving the best role in the movie. The last part of the movie is dynamic and filled with problems real people would have if found in a situation like that. But the explanation given at the very end was a bit to much for me. I heard that this was called ""the most scientifically accurate movie"" and that physicist around the world fought over the fact was that true or not. Nevertheless, way too much theoretical physics in the end. Since I love SF movies I am willing to look past the over- the-top science part, but what really got to me was that it was predictable. From the very moment I saw a black hole in the movie I put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a little. Regarding the acting, as I said before, Chastain gave the most powerful performance in the movie. She doesn't have much screen time, but she sure knows how to use it. The two that actually lead the movie - McConaughey and Hathaway were brilliant. McConaughey did a little better job handling the emotions of a father with the responsibilities of a team leader and the savior of mankind. His performance was outstanding. Hathaway was good, decent, without a single word that can be said against her, but for a movie like this, that is almost completely on the shoulders of the actors, she should have done more. The others did a good job, particularly Casey Affleck who's character was a grand comparison to Chastain's. The music given it was done by the mastermind Hans Zimmer was spectacular. Just the right notes, just the right timing, just the right music. His understanding of what movies should sound like is amazing. All in all, Interstellar is a magnificent movie. It is a type of movie Nolan does best. It has all the elements of being a classic like Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, it comes really close to being the new space odyssey, and it will not perish with time. Still, this might be a bit too much for the average moviegoer, a lot has to be digested here, it is not a simple or easy movie to watch. But, if your braincells don't shut off and you don't expect another Die Hard movie, you will appreciate this masterpiece.","

But where can you take all the people, to build their new churches and steeples, and how to get there, if you can find somewhere, without a breakthrough in science and maths rules.Juxtaposing a more than probabilistic forecast of things to come with the absurd, to produce a wholly engaging and imaginative piece of sci-fi that may well get you thinking of what might just happen to the planet and the people of it when the help and support of as yet undiscovered dimensions fails to materialise.Great performances, great effects, leaves you wanting to revisit 2001: A Space Odyssey but you know you'll never know why.","

It's extremely long but you won't get bored for a second. And that says enough about it. All the actors gave us a very good performance and some shots were stunning. The story was very well written even though sometimes too complicated to understand but then again who are we to understand anything about the unknown dimensions, black holes or wormholes. You have got to stay concentrated during the whole movie to understand the story but like I said before with Interstellar it is certainly not a problem at all. I was completely absorbed by the story and was actually surprised that time flew by so easily. One of the better movies I watched this year and certainly the best sci-fi in years.","

"prospectus_capricornium","5 November 2014","'Interstellar' takes off by constituting its soaring ambitions right at the very first few sequences of the film: humanity is struggling to survive in a barely habitable Earth, already at the brink of total destruction. Earth and its resources is down to its last few moments, but when a wormhole, a medium that enables space time-travel beyond known limits, is discovered, scientists and ordinary men gather together, to begin an exploration that would take time-traveling through different worlds, in man's desperate search for humanity's place among the stars.To fully understand 'Interstellar', its premise and its accuracy, may require repetitive thinking, research, and a certain level of intellect—perhaps the same level Nolan asked in 'Inception'. But the film does not necessarily ask its audience to right away fully understand it, instead it begs you to feel it, to experience its dilemmas and tragedies and go through the same threads of emotion tangled up within the web of humanity's last possible moments, and the relationship between a widowed father and his children already leaning toward an anticipated end. Nolan's made sure that even the film's ideas are too far-fetched and may seem resting on towering intellectual grounds, it would nonetheless connect to its audience by delivering its message through emotionally-charged tales of human relationships, tangible enough to be felt and experienced.At its core, is retired NASA engineer, Cooper (McConaughey) and his relationship with his children—most strikingly with his daughter, Murph. Cooper's emotional journey—the decision he has to make whether to leave his family behind or join the quest to search for a new habitable planet—alone, serves as an effective vessel to transport the audience from Earth, right from the moment the spacecract 'Endurance' takes off from the ground, to the unknown limits of the cosmos. McConaughey delivers a stunning and highly-commendable performance, and while I can't say its his best, as I've managed to have seen only a few of his movies, I can certainly say it's one of the best I've seen from any actor, so far, and he may be owing that to Nolan's impeccable direction. McConaughey's incredibly brilliant portrayal of a loving father places him at the center of the story. There are plenty of nail-biting sequences here depicting his devastation after the choices he needed to make and still has to take, and in each one, he never fails to effectively convey whatever emotion the sequence requires him to deliver.Nolan's mastery of his craft screams in deafening volumes through his unblemished capacity to explore and raise the layers of the film's characters and put their stories in right places and in valid highlights within the film, and that works best with the help of brilliant musical score orchestrated by the equally impeccable Hans Zimmer. Added with breath-taking cinematography and spectacular visual effects, together, these elements, make 'Interstellar' capable of weaving a human story powerful enough to intrude through our delicate emotional senses, delve into our humanity and still go beyond that. Nolan's managed to tread through the film's seemingly absurd scope and ambitions without losing focus on the one powerful element that seems to keep the film's aspects bonded together: LOVE. As chiché as it may sound, that may be the only thing that is right away understood and easily felt in the movie. There are a lot of questions raised, and each one poses another, but none of which really requires immediate answer, and by not losing grasp of the mystery of love, and the power it can deliver to make human connections tighter and even closer amidst the ever widening physical distance between the characters in the film, Nolan comes out victorious in making the audience feel and understand 'Interstellar' and have its questions answered, in a way that doesn't necessarily oblige us to just think, but also to make our emotions work as well, so we can have the experience the film wants us to go through.Sure, it can't be perfect, I myself noticed that it lacks focus with its narrative (this either because I find it hard to solve Nolan's puzzle-like construction of the story—LOL—or the narrative' s really not just that good. If you have seen Memento and Inception, the construction here is somehow similar as those two) and some respected critics even argue this one can't be Nolan's best, and I haven't seen all his works yet, either, but for me, it really isn't that hard to put this on the list of the best sci-fi movies I've seen so far. Nolan has put up together a perfect ensemble of outstanding actors, whose powerful performances, IMO, are enough to cover the flaws. Not a single bit of every actor's potential is put into waste, here; everyone has a star to shine in this universe Nolan created. Hans Zimmer's music seems to never go out of sync, in fact it almost always goes in harmony with the dramatic highlights of the film. Visual effects is never less than top-notch; the imagery presented in this film is utterly jaw-dropping, so expect to have your breath being repeatedly taken away by the frequent outburst of colors effectively employed to establish distinctions between the dimensions. All those elements are satisfyingly sufficient to create the deciding impulse needed to bring the movie to where it aims to arrive.'Interstellar' is a thought-provoking and mind-enriching motion picture, a grand and brilliantly depicted visual spectacle not bereft of human emotions, one of the best of its genre in a very long time. If this movie gets proclaimed as a classic in the coming decades, that definitely isn't going to come out as a surprise.This Christopher Nolan film deserves my 10 stars. :)","

"george.schmidt","12 November 2014","INTERSTELLAR (2014) ***1/2 Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Mackenzie Foy, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, William Devane, Leah Cairns, Topher Grace, Timothy Chalamet, Brooke Smith (voice of Bill Irwin) Filmmaker Christopher Nolan's valentine (of sorts) to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (and to his daughter) continues his streak of audacious sense of space (literally) and the inner human spirit : set in the bleak future Earth is on the descent of humanity with continuous food demands and climate change with one Hail Mary of a plan by NASA - send a small crew thru a wormhole (just go with it) to see if 'they' can help us. A grand ensemble of talent assembled but it is truly a shining moment of cool-as-a-cucumber and deeply felt performance by McConaughey as the astronaut/pilot of the journey into the realms of desperation, anchoring the film with a transfixing turn (largely due to his interplay with young talented actress Foy as his daughter - later played with clear-eyed intensity by Chastain), no easy task with all the eye candy visuals that are indeed awe inspiring and a kissing cousin to GRAVITY for sheer amazement (one must see it on a big screen and IMAX would be a start as it was filmed in the medium). Hathaway has a few moments as well particularly with her brainy scientist dad Caine (a Nolan regular). The true stars are the breathtaking cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, a stellar score by frequent collaborator Hans Zimmer and fantastic visual effects by literally dozens of geniuses. The only stumbling block is its slightly heavy handed message getting across but the Twilight Zone-ish final act makes up for it in spades. WOW!","

"MrDHWong","5 November 2015","Interstellar is a science fiction film co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Inception, Batman: The Dark Knight etc.) and starring Matthew McConaughey. I found it absolutely amazing, rarely do I use a word like 'spellbinding' to describe a movie but I really do feel like Interstellar is well worthy of it. Matthew McConaughey was excellent as well. He really shows the great emotional range he has as an actor.The story is about a group of explorers, led by former pilot and engineer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who embark on a journey through a newly discovered wormhole near the planet Saturn. Their main mission is to save humanity from extinction by an environmentally devastated Earth.The film was not only beautiful to look at, but it was very well written too. However, like with Inception, you REALLY need to pay attention to pretty much everything that happens to fully understand what is going on. It's difficult for me to go into too much detail without giving away important plot points so you'll just have to see for yourself.I rate it a very high 9.5/10 and I highly recommend it to any fan of Christopher Nolan and anyone who enjoys intelligent science fiction. I personally consider it one of the best and most thought provoking science fiction films I've ever seen.","

"AlukardsCastle","8 November 2014","-Plot- The year is unknown, but most likely close to present time. The Earth is running out of resources and a group of underground NASA workers seek the help of Engineer/Astronaut turned Farmer Mr. Cooper in taking a journey across the Galaxy and through a wormhole in hopes of a future for mankind on the other side.That is the gist of the exposition of the plot. It's mostly quite clear what this movie is about through previews. On paper this sounds like a typical sci-fi plot, but Chris Nolan executes it like never before. The movie seems to be getting more mixed reviews from critics compared to his other films, and I think I have an explanation. Nolan and his team had too much faith in it's audience. The movie is full of science and dialogue strongly textured with physics theories. The talk of wormholes and Black holes are key to the movie. But I know that many will be left confused even with the explanations of what is going on to make everything in the film scientifically possible. After all, Physicist Kip Thorne was a consultant for the movie! I found it quite educational, interesting, but also over done at times. A good majority of people who watch this movie will be turned off by the abundance of scientific talk throughout the movie. I personally loved it and was never lost, but I could understand why many people were frustrated with the constant turns in the plot and overlong length. I found this movie to be amazing. Sure, at times the dialogue was hard to even understand. There was a scene where a major character is dying, and as he speaks his last words, it's almost impossible to decipher what is said. It was also almost unintentionally humorous. But that was a small price to pay and I'm sure the subtitles of the Blu Ray release will save that scene for me. The directing and cinematography are gorgeously done. The camera angles really bring the movie to life. Simple shots from the point of view of the rear of a truck or spaceship never looked so amazing. The visuals were undeniably beautiful whether the setting was in space, on the foreign planet or even the decaying Earth. The music of the film by Hans Zimmer deserves so much recognition! I will even say it was better than the score for Inception. It really increased the tension and pushed for emotional heartache in many parts of the film. There are many tense scenes that will have you holding on along with the characters in the movie and a good portion of this effect is due to the musical score! The acting was top class. Matthew M gave one of the greatest human performances in history as Mr. Cooper. I seriously think it was better than his Dallas Buyers Oscar Winning performance. I really hope he gets recognition for this. There are more than a few scenes that will make even the most cold hearted person feel like crying. He was just amazing. Anne Hathaway gave a stunning emotional performance as the flawed Bland. Jessica Chastain has a few strong moments as well. There is a scene regarding her character breaking down which will definitely make your eyes water. The supporting cast all do justice to the movie too, but Matthew and Jessica gave the best performances without a doubt.In a way, this movie resembles Inception in certain areas. Inception had a hint of relativity in it with the time differences between the dreams, the real world and limbo. Interstellar adds to that with the inclusion of a planet in the other galaxy in which every hour is equal to 7 years outside of its atmosphere. In Inception, a central character is left behind and lost in the limbo world with its major difference of time. In Interstellar, a central character is left behind in the other galaxy to find a new home while the other leaves to help the current home adjust until then. In Inception, a central character is old for a moment in limbo at the end due to the difference in time relativity. In Interstellar, the time relativity affects the entire human race as the astronauts are in the other galaxy. In both movies, the main character has left behind children and longs to be reunited. Inceptions main character doesn't want to see his children's faces until they are truly reunited. But in Interstellar, he holds on to the image of their faces as a survival tactic. This movie is full of Christopher/Jonathan Nolan-isms. Overall, I think that this movie should be seen in theaters on the big screen if you have the chance. It was a true experience. Be sure to be attentive and to clear your bladder first though. It will make you think. At times it might make you check your watch, but please endure and you will be treated to one of the most intriguing films of all time. Even if you think you didn't like the film, there is no doubt that you will be thinking about the contents of the plot and beauty of the visuals long after the credits roll.","

"shawneofthedead","7 November 2014","Not many directors have the clout of Christopher Nolan. Most of them receive notes from their fretting studios: suggestions (or demands) to change plot points or highlight certain characters/actors, which must be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. With huge, intelligent blockbuster successes like the Dark Knight franchise and Inception, Nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from Warner Bros. for Interstellar - he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy to realise his artistic vision. In effect, he's making an indie movie on a blockbuster scale. Ironically, this lack of oversight might be just what keeps Interstellar - a very good, occasionally brilliant foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond - from greatness.Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot and engineer, is now reluctantly scraping together a living as a farmer on a starving Earth. With sandstorms swirling and food supplies dwindling by the day, it doesn't seem likely that Cooper's children, stoic Tom and inquisitive Murphy, will have much of a world left to inherit when they grow up. While investigating a ""ghost"" in Murphy's bedroom, Cooper deciphers a message that brings him to a top-secret NASA base. Once there, Cooper learns from his former mentor, Dr Brand (Michael Caine), that NASA is looking for solutions to Earth's crisis in other galaxies. A recently-opened wormhole has given NASA and its scientists access to a whole new galaxy of planets. Brand appeals to Cooper to pilot the final and most important mission: to determine whether any of three identified planets can truly host human life. But it's a journey from which Cooper might never return - one that will take him away from his kids and everything he has ever known and loved.That's not even the half of it – Nolan's narrative is a sprawling, ambitious one that asks heavy metaphysical questions about the position and role of humanity in the universe, filtered through the prism of a father and daughter whose bond transcends time and space. It's shot through with complex scientific theories about wormholes and time travel courtesy of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (who served as a consultant on the film). Indeed, much of Interstellar plays with such philosophical gravity that one can't help wondering if it's simply too deep a subject to be effectively communicated in a movie that must also create emotional stakes and real characters.Clocking in at almost three hours, Interstellar pulses with intelligence and occasional bursts of brilliance. The science and emotion of its story works best on each planet they manage to visit, with Nolan crafting some chillingly smart sci-fi moments amidst the human drama experienced by Cooper's crew. As badly as Cooper wants to save enough fuel to make the return trip home, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) has both professional and personal stakes in visiting the planet that's furthest away from the wormhole. They trade hope for time, the minutes they use to hunt for salvation translating into the loss of decades with their loved ones. The film is at its best when the members of the Endurance - including David Gyasi's Romilly and Wes Bentley's Doyle - confront one another, and establish contact (or fail to do so) with the scouting teams that preceded them through the wormhole.But Interstellar also suffers from a bloated and faintly silly final act. The science of it may be well-founded (who knows, after all, what miraculous answers really do lie within a black hole?) and the concept very cool, but it doesn't quite translate as such. Instead, the film hyper-blasts itself into a oddly cheerful (and confusing) ending that feels purely fictional and not at all scientific. There's no denying, either, that Nolan could have carved half an hour or more out of Interstellar without losing any of its narrative or emotional density. Instead, many scenes unfold in an almost obstinately languid fashion, including a moment when Cooper is left gasping for oxygen on the icy terrain of an alien planet. It's pretty evident, too, that Nolan really wanted to make sure his audiences knew how little greenscreen he used to make the film; for no other discernible reason, his camera lingers in extreme close-up - and far too often - on the exterior shells of the various spacecrafts designed for the film.Nolan can afford the best when it comes to his cast as well, and it shows. McConaughey anchors the film with a gravitas and tenderness quite unknown before his career McConnaissance, and he's ably supported by a steely Hathaway, whose character, just like the film she's in, blends cold, pragmatic science with a churning wealth of emotion. Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon, in roles perhaps best left unspecified to avoid any explicit spoilers, are excellent too - the former radiates quite enough warmth and intelligence to make us believe that she can save the world, and the latter admirably treads in morally grey areas to good effect.For months before its release, Nolan kept Interstellar firmly under wraps. Everyone speculated that it would be a game-changer - a sci- fi blockbuster as thrilling and thought-provoking as it is entertaining. In some ways, that's true of the final product: Nolan's film is brave, brainy film-making, and it looks absolutely spectacular. But, on closer examination, Interstellar loses some of its gloss and varnish - and beneath it all lies an unwieldy script that meanders a little too long and wastes a little too much of the big, breathtaking ideas that underpin its story.","

"michaelRokeefe","8 November 2014","Christopher Nolan directs an enthralling space odyssey, co-written with his brother Jonathan. This movie lives up to the hype and is one not to be missed. The earth is chocking as it is a starving Dirt Bowl. The future is dim as farmers are producing less and less to feed the population. Cooper(Matthew McConaughey)is a former test pilot and widower raising two children, fifteen year old Tom(Timothee Chalamet) and ten year old Murph(Mackenzie Foy), who is suspended from school for fighting. She refuses to believe the school books being right, saying the Apollo missions were faked in order to bankrupt Russia's space program.Cooper and daughter stumble across the remnants of the believed to be defunct NASA, where Professor Brand(Michael Caine) convinces Cooper he is the only one to command a mission to be launched into space in search of a new planet that can sustain life. The flight must enter a wormhole that will warp time, but allow a crew to rescue data from explorers, who preceded them. A member of Cooper's mission is Brand's daughter(Anne Hathaway). Deep on the mind of Cooper's daughter is the fact that if and when her father makes it back to earth, he will be the same age or older than her due to the time warp.No little green men, no aliens in sight. There are a couple of highly intelligent computerized robots, so to speak. Visually awesome and enhanced by Hans Zimmer's score. McConaughey seems driven and invested. Young Miss Foy is very watchable. And Jessica Chastain is excellent in the role of the adult Murph. Also in the cast: John Lithgow, Wes Bently, Matt Damon, William Devane, Casey Affleck and Ellen Burstyn. Plus the voices of Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart. INTERSTELLAR is stellar!","

"pipoulefr","5 November 2014","I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly ""X"", will managed to convince you about that.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought.","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","12 May 2018","'Interstellar (2014)' is a space-epic that feels remarkably intimate and emotionally resonant while also being sweeping in scope and visually stunning. The mixture of earthy textures and sleek sci-fi aesthetics makes for an interesting visual juxtaposition between the two sets of characters. While its third act does get a little existential and abstract, the narrative reasoning behind it and scientific integrity leading up to it allows for constant believability. This film never fails to have an impact on me, it is truly breathtaking work. In fact, it is one of my favourite pictures of all time. 10/10","

"millert1409","5 November 2014","'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the ""fi"" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date.","

"classicsoncall","15 November 2014","Uh-oh, here I go again. The movie's out, what, a week or so as I write this, and IMDb voters have it ranked the 11th best movie of all time!!?? If there's justice in a rational world this would never happen. But it's not a rational world anymore now, is it, when an MIT professor can be found on tape explaining how the President's signature health care law was built on lies and deceit, and the media isn't even interested in covering the story.I could rant on but what's the point. I guess if your name is Nolan, any movie that comes out with the director's fingerprints on it will be hailed as monumental. I don't have a beef with Nolan personally, I think he makes some visually fantastic films (this is one to be sure), but most of the time I think the hype precedes the product and then everyone else falls in line singing the praises.Case in point - ""Interstellar"". Nominally a sci-fi thriller, the picture devolves into something of a time travel anomaly that leaves the viewer scratching their head when hero Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) finds himself on the wrong side of the bookshelves in one of the picture's pivotal moments. I'm sitting there thinking 'this is what I came to see the movie for'? I'm not even going to start on Coop's selection to save the planet just by showing up at Professor Brand's (Michael Caine) facility. Which by the way, didn't it start out as some shack in the desert? When we get a tour of the place, it's got NASA central looking like a global conglomerate.Speaking of which, how is it NASA's still around for this massive undertaking to repatriate all of Earth's citizens to another planet? Unless I'm mistaken, NASA's primary goal now is Muslim outreach and all the best and brightest brains have farmed out. My head is starting to hurt.It was a small theater crowd last night, and I usually don't do this, but since a gentleman ahead of me held the door as I filed out, I asked him what he thought of the movie. His exact words were ""That was a piece of excrement"", only he used the more colloquially popular term for excrement. I wouldn't go that far, but if one hour in the wormhole equals seven years of Earth time, you're going to get old real fast trying to understand this picture.","

"gstards","4 November 2014","Love is the one thing that transcends time and space... New creation of Christopher Nolan's genius, whose name is now known to everyone. His films are waiting with a special look, because it offers something that every day, unfortunately, less and less can be found in the world of mass cinema - an interesting spectacle, filled with meaning, ideas and emotions. At this time, Christopher decided to send us not to the world of dreams, and even not on the dark streets of Gotham City. No, now he send us to the journey to, and perhaps beyond the boundaries of the possible and impossible, through the curvature of space and time, in other worlds. And you won't forget this trip, this can be assured. I was madly waiting for Interstellar's release. And then, finally, I was able to see this Beauty - at the premiere in my coutry on October, 29. It was incredibly exciting. It was a delight. It was unforgettable. It was gorgeous. Nolan once again amazes the viewer's imagination by his painting. Journey to the brink of infinity, the line where humanity has never set, acts as either the first-born purpose and a background of emotional history about the father and the daughter. A loving father who mankind need to help, but that he should leave his children, and a loving daughter who doesn't want to let her dad in the infinity darkness. Starting from the very first frame and ending with the closing credits, a new picture of Nolan will absorb you completely, forcing stare at the screen during the whole action, because it's all so exciting and interesting that escape becomes physically impossible. No, this three hours won't fly quickly for you. You'll feel every emotion, every event, every character. You will not look how the main characters travel through the universe, because the movie experience in this film is so excellent that you will be on board of ""Endurance"" starship and travel between the worlds with the main characters by yourself.The emotional core of this story is the relationship of Matthew McConaughey's character and his daughter - Mackenzie Foy' and Jessica Chastain' character. And the acting work of these three artists in ""Interstellar"" impress the most. McConaughey was acting really great, and this is one of the most emotional, if not the most emotional role of his life. All the drama and tragedy of the relationship of father and daughter in this film will not leave anyone indifferent. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and other actors also coped with their roles and presented the film's supporting characters very realistic. I would particularly like to note a small but important in this story role of Matt Damon, a character who has received quite memorable. If we talk about the characters, it should be noted also two robots that accompanied our heroes in this difficult journey. One of them adds a touch of humor in the film, which mitigates constantly depressing, dramatic, and sometimes really dark atmosphere.The script of the film is very well combined the history of space exploration and the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The story is complex and complicated, is based on real scientific theories by Kip Thorne, and indeed contains a reference to the ""Space Odyssey"" and other sci-fi pictures. This story about true love, about loyalty, forgiveness, fraud, hard decisions, and much more. And it is designed so that leaves a lot of room for the imagination of the viewer. It's also possible to notice some structure allusion to another Nolan's work - Inception. The story and visuals are combined just perfectly in Interstellar.Hans Zimmer's score, written by him on the basis of only one letter from Nolan, hold the key: ""Once we become parents, we can't help but look at ourselves through the eyes of our children"", deserves a special praise. On this basis, Hans managed to write just incredible soundtrack that perfectly harmonizes with the history and the visual side of the picture. And this work of the composer is really different from the previous ones. It is executed in a different style from another subject in its base. Very impressive work, which will be pleasantly listened again and separate from the film itself. Visual range of the picture is incredibly beautiful and circuses. The ""Endurance"" itself, new worlds, insanely beautiful and mysterious space, wormholes, black holes, and travel through them, folds of time and space are arranged so that is simply breathtaking. I would like to thank all those who contributed to the creation of a visual of this film. It must be seen. That mastery with which this is done, not just words. In the visual pattern also has some references to the Kubrick's ""Odyssey"", and they are pleasing to the eye.Many thanks to Christopher Nolan for having given us such an incredible movie, which once again proved to us that the cinema is Nolan's life. ""Interstellar"" is a film that wins the hearts of the audience not only with its sci-fi splendor, but also an emotional story that lies at its very heart. This film is not only about the discoveries, space exploration and the final frontier of mankind, but also about the relationship of father and daughter, who were in a difficult situation in life when one has to leave the other in the name of a goal that can not be underestimated. So, with what Nolan's genius unfolds before us this action is beyond praise. Combining the story, filled with not only real science fiction, but the true human values ​​and emotions, outstanding and very emotional performances, breathtaking visuals, epic and dramatic soundtrack, Christopher Nolan breathed the life into this film by his directing to create something truly masterpiece again.

Am I the only one that was extremely distracted by plot holes, an inexplicable ""love will save the day"" ending, and Matthew McConaughey's fake tan? Alright so Matthew McConaughey is an ex spaceship pilot, stumbles upon NASA cuz, you guys, the government is evil now, is recruited for a mission to save the planet by finding another planet to colonize. Plan A is to evacuate Earth and move to that planet. That plan (SPOILERS!) is a sham. The real plan is Plan B, which is to repopulate the new planet with embryos. So is Anne Hathaway going to give birth to a hundred babies? How exactly is that going to work? They save Matt Damon. He turns out to be evil and loyal to Plan B.

But Matthew McConaughey goes rogue and gets sucked into a black hole. The power of love transports him to his daughter's bedroom (?) - but IN THE PAST YOU GUYS, and he sends messages with Morse Code. Apparently transferring all of the data he's learned about...something or another...through Morse Code (that's one heck of a compression scheme), which allows his daughter to save humanity. He then gets saved from the black hole (?). Reunites with daughter on Saturn (?). And sets up the premise for the sequel. The plot isn't so much twisting and turning as it is just convulsing and flatlining. I didn't really care about any of the characters - actually Matt Damon was the most interesting. The film takes literally an hour to get to space (just c'mon already!). And by the point that the The Power of Love intervenes, I was just sitting in my chair quietly laughing. Gravity was way better.","

"framptonhollis","29 August 2015","This is a movie with plenty of things going for it. Great performances, incredible visual effects, an interesting story, and tons of really cool concepts, which make for a few genuinely powerful scenes, However, that doesn't make it the flawless masterpiece of cinematic genius everybody is labeling it as. There are tons of people giving this movie 10/10 ratings, leading to a user rating of 8.7, and it is now #29 on the IMDb top 250. WOW! That is a lot of praise! On the top 250, ""Interstellar"" is above ""Casablanca"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Psycho"", ""Apocalypse Now"", and ""CITIZEN KANE""! According to the users on IMDb, this movie's better than ""Citizen Kane"", which has been known as possibly the greatest film of all time!Is is better than ""Citizen Kane""? No, not even close. The film is full of flaws, the biggest being the runtime. I may never see this movie again because of how long it felt! It feels like a lot of scenes are unneeded, and were made just so the movie could be longer, because Christopher Nolan wanted to make it seem really epic. I'm sure if Nolan cut a huge chunk of the movie out, it would've been better. A film by Nolan that is better than this one is ""The Dark Knight"", which has a somewhat long runtime, but it feels way shorter than it's runtime, and is extremely entertaining throughout. ""Interstellar"" is so long that it starts to really drag on and, at times, I began to just zone out.The film is also a bit too dramatic. The dialogue about how ""love conquers all"" seemed very unnecessarily corny, as well as a few other select scenes in the movie. However, some sequences were quite powerful, especially the ending, which, actually, was kind of creepy. The concept of time was very prominent throughout the film, and it lead to some pretty creative and powerful sequences.Overall, the film is recommended, but you should be warned that this movie was LOOOOOOOONG!!!!!!","

"cosmo_tiger","16 November 2014","""We're still pioneers. We've barely begun. Our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us because our destiny lies above us."" Mankind has finally used up all of Earth's resources and it has become a dying planet. When Cooper (McConaughey) and his daughter stumble upon a secret outpost that contains the remnants of NASA they are told of the seriousness of the problem facing humanity. Cooper is a former astronaut and is given the responsibility of traveling into space to find a habitable planet for the human race. I have been writing these little reviews for almost 5 years now and for the most part I have found it easy to talk about every movie. This one I can't seem to find the right words for. The reason has less to do with my vocabulary and more to do with the awesomeness of the movie. There are some movies that words just cannot do justice to. The last one I felt that way about was The Passion Of The Christ. This is a movie you want to tell everyone about but no matter what you say it's just not enough. I loved Gravity and this was 1,000 times better. Overall, really nothing I can say about this movie other than watch it. Christopher Nolan is a genius. I easily give this an A+","

"rubenm","11 November 2014","So, did I get this right? The essence of time-space relativity is that you're able to see a younger version of yourself from behind a bookcase, and shout in vain that you shouldn't do what you're about to do? Yes, that's how silly this movie is. 'Interstellar' is supposed to be a film exploring Einstein's relativity theory. It shows how space travelers enter a 'wormhole' to find new planets where they can find a future for mankind, which is suffering from heat, drought and hunger on planet Earth. By doing so, they enter a parallel time frame where one hour equals seven years on earth. The problem is that the film is tackling this subject in such a clumsy way that it makes you laugh rather than anything else. Take the robots that assist the space travelers during their voyage through time and space. Are we really to believe that thinking computers in the future would take the form of clunky metal boxes, assembled in such a way that they can walk on two legs? I would suppose an intelligent operating system for a smart phone or iPad would be much more convenient. In that respect, 'Her' was much more realistic. I could go on. How about a top scientist saying things like: 'Only love transcends time and space, so why don't we put our trust in that?' Or how about handing the command of the space ship that's supposed to save the human race to a farmer who finds the secret launching pad by coincidence? And how about the only woman in the crew being in love with another space traveler who is lost somewhere on another planet? Apart from this, there are several other things about this film I didn't like. The over-the-top soundtrack, filled with some sort of church organ music. The artificial dialogues, mostly intended to explain unexplainable things. The numerous melodramatic and tear-jerking scenes. The subtle message that love is superior to science. The countless scenes of the space ship shuddering and rattling, as if it were a Boeing flying through a patch of turbulence. I had hoped this big budget production by a talented director like Christopher Nolan could appeal to non sci-fi fans like me. But I was disappointed.","

"planktonrules","22 February 2015","The first 80-90% of ""Interstellar"" I absolutely loved and was prepared to give this movie a 10. Sadly, the ending inexplicably had an ending that didn't make a lot of sense and only seemed there in order to tack on a nice Hollywood ending and wrap everything up perfectly. It's sad, but apparently the public embraced this sort of ending...so who am I to complain?!As for the film, there are a bazillion reviews so I will be brief. The film has incredible special effects and is a film best seen in the movie theater. On a HUGE screen at home, it would still lose something. Like the wonderful ""Gravity"", it just needs the big screen...trust me with this. The story is exceptional and offers many wonderful twists (up until the disappointing ending that is) and there are a lot of wonderful performances. Overall, the good certainly outweighs the bad and it's a film to see. But as for me, an ending with more sadness and vagueness would have been okay.","

"3xHCCH","6 November 2014","The Earth in the near future is a shell of what it used to be. The plant life is dying. The very soil that used to sustain it is destroying it. There are some underground efforts headed by Prof. Brand (Michael Caine) called Lazarus to find an alternative world to settle in somewhere out there in the vast reaches of space. Three such potential worlds have been found beyond a black hole near Saturn.Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a retired NASA engineer who had been chosen to pilot this effort to seek out and investigate these alternative planets. Despite the stiff objections of his 10-year old daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), he accepts the mission and lifted off together with his crew of three scientists, Amelia (Anne Hathaway), Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi). From there, we are brought on an unparalleled adventure of space, time and humanity by a master who is probably the most mentally-challenging writer and director in the film industry today, Christopher Nolan. Front and center in this spectacular sci-fi film is the timeless bond between a father and his daughter. The poetic story he has written is multi- layered and emotional, despite its scientific jargon and bleak settings.As with his other projects, Nolan works with some of the best technical talents, many of whom are award-winners in their fields. Everyone on this team are guaranteed at least Oscar nominations for their work in this film, and they may in fact all actually win.Film editor Lee Smith, sound engineers Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo and musical scorer Hans Zimmer together effectively create excitement and drama. The cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking especially in those wide landscape shots, both on earth and on those other planets. The visual effects are innovative as ever, particularly in the third act where a whole new dimension was created. Production designer Nathan Crowley had some nifty ideas for his futuristic props. The circular design of the mother ship Endurance was beautiful in its symmetry. The designs of the robotic sidekicks TARS and CASE are in no way similar those in Star Wars. Matthew McConaughey continues his streak of acting excellence which was just capped by an Oscar earlier this year. Michael Caine was as good as he could be expected to be. However, I found his final speech too garbled to be understood well, and it contained an important plot point. Anne Hathaway's role is a bit of a puzzle for me. While she was actually managed to be credible as a scientist, she had a rather cheesy monologue that seemed out of place when it was delivered.Three talented actresses portray the character of Murphy Cooper at different ages: Mackenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn. Foy goes way beyond what she was required to do in her two previous hit films the ""Breaking Dawn"" films and ""The Conjuring"". Chastain is such a riveting presence as ever, and it was good to see her again after her long break after ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Mama."". Oscar winner Burstyn's singular big scene made me tear up.In the second hour, I was surprised to see a special, heretofore uncredited, big name guest star portray one of the pioneer Lazarus astronauts, Dr. Mann. This was more than a mere cameo appearance, as his character had a critical role to play in one of the many twisting episodes of this story.From ""Memento"", then ""The Prestige"" to ""Inception"", Nolan had gone for the extremes in terms of plot development. His work is not always easily comprehended on first watch. They are thought-provoking and demanding in terms of a viewer's patience and concentration. ""Interstellar"" joins this stellar list, and we are brought to yet another dimension of time and space. 10/10.","

"Balthazar-5","13 November 2014","Though I am not a Bat-person, and do not wish to become one, I have admired Christopher Nolan for his early films and 'Inception', though, with the exception of 'Insomnia', I always regarded them as, in the immortal words of Andrew Sarris 'less than meets the eye'. I do not like to call films pretentious, but with 'Memento' and 'Inception' the word certainly came to mind. They seemed shallow pretending to be deep.The same is, in my opinion, certainly true of 'Interstellar'. Yes, it carries you along for a ride, and yes the special effects are great, and yes, it might give us pause to think what will, in fact, be the destiny of our species. But, my dear Mr Nolan, surely you must realise that our species will not survive by planting American flags on distant planets. And, like 'Gravity' before it, the search for a happy ending has totally destroyed any shred of credibility of what might have gone before. The image of Cooper floating around Saturn without his spaceship, waiting to be picked up by a passing probe (just before his oxygen runs out, of course) is so ridiculous that if Stanley Kubrick were to be told that it is a respectful reference to the 'starchild' at the end of '2001', he'd punch you in the nose. 'Interstellar' - for all of its attempts to incorporate relativistic time dilation and very clever (I do not use that word in a derogatory sense) visual representation of multi-dimensional string theory towards the end, is void of any real cultural insight.The film simply extends 'The Wizard of Oz' into the space age and decides at the end that there is really somewhere better than home. It is TOSH! Great films tell us something memorable about the human condition, or the nature of cinema itself. This film, for all its quotes from Dylan Thomas does neither. It is for people who think that the word 'awesome' has some profound meaning and not, as is the case, an excuse for not finding a more appropriate and restrained reaction. Any suggestion that it deserves a Best Picture Oscar is a sad comment on the way that those awards have become debased in recent years.","

"A_Different_Drummer","23 January 2015","Not so much film as much as strange milestone for Hollywood.With A-List stars and a final running length of about 3 hours.This in an age where Hollywood is so desperate for profit and fast turnover that even TV shows have more commercials and less content.How is this possible? Easy answer: Nolan Brothers. Look in a mirror, say those names 7 times quickly, the Hollywood Rule Book disappears.The bizarre length effectively gives the viewer not one but three entirely separate movies joined only by the title.This reviewer in particular was gob-smacked by the first movie, effectively from the beginning until the space flight, and wanted to jump to an alternate universe where the whole movie took place in that small town, post-apocalyptic setting. With the dust. And stray drones. And the school teachers who taught that the trip to the moon was just propaganda.I cannot over-emphasize how strange this is. Even though that was not the point of the film, I suggest the production company unintentionally created (in that first hour) the best sci-fi future-world ambiance in the history of film; and, unaware of what they had accidentally done, they just moved on.BTW, a number of futurists have said that in the early part of the 21st century the odds favor at least one major volcano going ""super,"" or blowing for extended days or weeks. This will place ash/dust in the air will will cover the planet. Until this film, I never saw the image of what this might look like. Now I know. Wow.) The second film is like every Star Trek film you have ever seen, but by way of Stanley Kubrick. Not bad, but nowhere near as much fun as the first portion, Another really really cool thing is the robot that resembles one of those ladder kits you buy at Home Depot, that can form a variety of shapes. Ultra cool.Until you finally get to the third and final movie (or Act) which is meant to have profound spiritual implications but in reality only works if you have been paying careful attention for the first two and a half hours. Which is itself a strange contradiction.But the whole film is full of contradictions. There is an Epilogue too (following the unstated theme of three Acts and an Epilogue). It is fun, it is moving, it connects with the viewer, and it makes no sense at all. There are plot holes in the Epilogue that you could lose a Black Hole in. Joke intended.So, there you go, one of the oddest and most contradictory films of all time.Oh, don't even bother trying to figure out how a society that can develop AI to a degree beyond anything ever seen in film before (the Costco ladder people) still has teachers that dispute the Moon Landing and doctors who can't deal with a cough.As I keep saying, a very strange movie.But a very powerful one*** REVIEW UPDATED OCT 2016****Greetings from the year 2016. For those reading this from the far future when everyone who wishes it has instant access to the IMDb database, probably beamed right into the cortex, I am updating my review with this addenda: I confess I missed the point of the film on first viewing. After all, this is a Nolan Bros 3 hr opus which, sadly, never really achieved a proper audience and now is more or less lost to time, much like the characters in the story. On second viewing, I ""got"" that this is basically a love story set against a sci-fi backdrop. The love of a father for his daughter, the growth of Man to a new dimensional experience where love itself is quantifiable - these are amazing concepts and this is an amazing movie.","

"larrys3","3 April 2015","At over 2100 reviews at the time of this writing, I guess there's nothing left to be said other than my opinion.I'd probably need a PhD in Physics from MIT to understand half of the technological terms in the movie, but I still found it to be rather awesome. After reading some of the reviews here, I think a lot of people are taking this sci-fi fantasy tale way too seriously and literally.Christopher Nolan's latest, which he co-wrote as well with his brother Jonathan, at 2 hrs and 48 min in length, can be ridiculously absurd one moment then quickly turn into riveting action the next.Matthew McConaughy and Anne Hathaway lead a long list of screen notables here, too numerous to mention. I did want to mention that I thought Mackenzie Foy, as Murph, the 10-year-old daughter of McConaughy was terrific in her role.I thought the musical score here was excellent, the wit and humor of the robot TARS (Bill Irwin) was on target. the special effects could be rather hokey at times but then other times were amazing, and the movie did contain a number of twists and turns which I liked.All in all, despite its' drawbacks I found this sci-fi fantasy to be a rather awesome and epic ride.","

"CMTiago","16 April 2015","As I begin this review of Christopher Nolan's latest movie, I want to point out the gorgeous visuals that we as an audience were able to behold with Interstellar. I truly believe this to be the movie's best quality and a true feat for the people in charge of visual effects. Having said this, I believe that many viewers were divisive over the plot's complexities. In fact, this is the most emotion driven movie I've seen from Nolan, something that he isn't ultimately known for. Nolan's strenght as a director lies in his ability to present us with a vision. He is meticulous and works the technical aspect of a film like no other director today. Once again, this is proved in every frame shot for Interstellar. So leaving behind my long praise, I now redirect this review to the story.The earth is dying, as the effects of our abuse of the natural resources is taking out the crops of food we need to survive. Upon this dark scenario, former NASA engineer Cooper (McConaughey) is asked to pilot a spaceship with the purpose of crossing a wormhole that will lead to another galaxy. This, of course, in hopes of reaching three possible habitable planets explored by scientists sent there in previous missions. Given the unpredictable nature of an unknown environment such as a different galaxy, Cooper will have to decide whether he is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of humanity or if the urge to reunite with his daughter again is stronger. Personally I liked the story Nolan told us with this film, as it left you thinking about it after the movie was over, something Nolan does very well with his projects. Compared with his previous work, there are still movies that I love more than this. Still Interstellar is a brilliant film in it's own right and yet another great addition to this great director's Filmograhpy.In the end all I can say is, if you're a Sci-Fi fan, you surely must not miss this one. It will offer an unique visual experience and leave you wondering what the hell you just watched, even if you didn't feel completely satisfied.Rating: 8/10","

"westsideschl","20 April 2015","A lot of mistaken pop science and poor attention to details makes this film a dumbing experience. Films based in history, biography and science need both the writers and viewers to do the hard work of reading the appropriate research so that we are bettered by the film experience. Director's/producers need to pay attention to detail for excellence. As follows: 1. Blight is usually strain or variety specific and is easily constrained by climate variability and solved easily with cross or genetic breeding. Source and type of blights was never explained probably because it just can't happen the way depicted. 2. Dust storms would be limited to a few limited environs and would soon hit bedrock. Besides, crop rotation and contouring should have solved that problem. 3. Drone was suppose to have been aloft for years using solar panels, but no solar panels visible. Propulsion was? 4. The pulp fiction fable of no Apollo/non-moon landing event is not taken seriously by anyone who is a middle school graduate. 5. McConaughey did his famous finger rubbing thinking prior to kicking a tire but what makes no sense is how kicking a tire makes a vehicle functional. 6. Movie relied on an excessive amount of loud tonal sound effects to create drama when writing and acting just not up to the task. 7. Communicating in barcode or Morse is not how any intelligent future beings would rely on. And, later the gravity–quantum equations coming from the future in Morse which doesn't have Calc encodings. Certainly not through watch hand movement. 8. Female role model in Hathaway was cast for smile/looks not for contributing anything believably intelligent. 9. Dad, Dr. Brand, also poorly cast only for accent and stereotyped science look. 10. Dropping bombs on starving people was presented as a solution – that sounded really ridiculous. 11. Looking for new Earth in another Galaxy when your own offers millions of possibilities is like looking for new home on the other side of the planet when one just like it is next door. 12. The energy required to open or even enter a wormhole would be equivalent to the total of our Sun's output for a thousand years. Also, if you can place it next to Saturn then why not closer like next to Mars to make transporting humanity easier. 13. The wormhole as well as the blackhole would shed matter to subatomic particle size. Communicating through a wormhole. Whoever wrote that has no idea of the scale of problems. 14. Speaking of Mars it can be terraformed with a few H-bombs to release CO2 to warm the planet thus melting subsurface ice to give H20 thus oxygen. 15. Turning on and off hibernation is not like opening the fridge; too many opportunities to damage cells. 16. Underground centrifuge space station was constructed of massive concrete which has only compressive strength not tensile strength. 17. Centrifuge center had a Saturn type rocket (100m high) which when blasts off should destroy that whole complex. In reality a complex that large and built underground would bankrupt half the world. 18. Those quantum gravity equations would not fit on that small blackboard. And, why are they using a blackboard in a tech world capable of traveling easily through space? Surely they must have at least an iPad! 19. So, not explained was how love brought Cooper through multiple dimensions (possibly Universes) to the exact correct time & space that Murph happened to occupy. Probably because the writer couldn't. 20. TARS sounded military dumb and those legs are not designed for surviving uneven surfaces without damage, let alone running. 21. The film's ending of throwing papers, the Eureka and the anonymous kiss was typical Hollywoodish. 22. Ranger view of Earth did not show a devastated planet but normal cloud cover; normal water and land color. 23. Five dimensional space-time is decades old-hat. Seven, nine and for the past dozen years; eleven dimensions is now the most likely mathematical construct. Remember that's all this is - a construct. 24. The effort to push books off a shelf would either be equally the same in all dimensions or not possible so that extra effort shown was just dramatic invention. 25. The interweaving of 1990s cars and other old tech, such as lap tops, all simultaneous with space vehicles & stations not yet achievable for several more decades, didn't make sense - incongruous. 26. The alternate Earth being made habitable by altering some made-up chemistry between chlorine and ammonia and their relation to N2 didn't make planetary chemistry sense, especially since such a planet would be hundred thousand times more rare than the more abundant habitable planets; also most likely more than a -100 degrees below zero. Conclusion: So many holes in this film that only a worm would love.","

"cherold","13 March 2015","I have to begin this review by acknowledging that I saw this movie under less than optimal conditions - on the screen on the back of a Jet Blue seat. Whatever visual magic might have impressed me was grainy and small, and the sound was murky. There's a good chance I would have liked this film better if seen properly.That being said, I probably wouldn't have liked it a *lot* better, because the things I didn't like would have been the same.First off, I thought the movie was off to a real slow start. It was basically a dust bowl family saga, and while I'll admit you needed some context for what happens later, it felt like it went on much too long.The early space experience also didn't engage me that much. Part of the problem might just be my expectations for a Christopher Nolan movie. I knew almost nothing about this film going in, but I think of Nolan as the director of Inception and Memento, and Interstellar was just so darn straightforward (at least at first).Eventually (the movie is almost three hours, so it really takes its time) the film's more intriguing ideas appear, such as the trickiness of relative time. The movie also becomes more eventful. Yet still there were things I found offputting; the first death in the movie makes no sense; it shouldn't have happened, and realistically wouldn't have. (Later I read a critique that pointed out that the whole scene wouldn't have happened that way unless everyone involved was an idiot.) The movie did, become more engrossing as it got more involved, playing with its time concept and tossed in some interesting twists and suspenseful moments. Alas, whatever gains the movie had made in my heart were squandered in the end. Apparently the movie had a scientist to make sure the science was good, and perhaps it was, yet to me the final part seemed incredibly silly, with way too much leaning on non-science things like intuition. And the last scenes were just .... huh? (Although someone in the IMDb board came up with a very Christopher Nolan interpretation of the end that I found more appealing.)As I say, if I'd seen it on the big screen I might have been more forgiving of its flaws, and it's very possible things like the reportedly hardcore seriousness with which it approached getting the look of a black hole just right would have made its length and plot weaknesses more palatable. But even saying that, I cannot see any way this movie would ever impress me as much as it has others.","

"Wrapper30","24 November 2014","I sent to see Interstellar on Saturday night and have just spent 45 incredulous minutes reading the reviews. The film I went to see was dull, preposterous and far far far too long. Let's start with the idea. A good one but poorly displayed. I wanted to know more about how humanity was destroying the planet. All I got was old folk I am guessing talking about the duststorms of the 1920's and 1930's? Perhaps they were attempting to lay the foundation for the whole premise of the film? I also wanted to know more about Cooper but we didn't really see how he became a farmer other than the flashback at the start. When did his wife die? Why is his father in law living with him? Did we really get to understand the relevance of the droid they chased in the truck? Unfortunately most of the film is taken up with barely audible dialogue about scientific hypothesis and personal issues intertwined together. This made it very difficult to follow and the interest wanes as a result. BUT the biggest downfall of the film is Matt Damon. I am a fan off his but not in this. He is dreadfully miscast as the villain of the piece of sorts and that whole fight with Cooper and Ryan is poor. It is just not convincing at all and there is no suspense involved in the whole docking scene at all. Cooper just tells him not to dock as he hasn't got the codes but you never felt Ryan was in jeopardy. It was so poorly constructed. Overall vey similar to Inception in that it is at times visually stunning but rather like Inception it is style over substance. Beautiful to look at but like opening a strawberry cream in a box of Quality Street - very disappointing. And the title of my review? I am just a bit fed up that Nolan has made some fine early films and now nobody will criticise him? In The Emperors New Clothes nobody tells the Emperor he is wearing nothing until a little boy informs him. Somebody needs to tell Nolan that he needs to get back to crafting films full of suspense and not a plodding sci-fi full of characters you barely care about.","

"tedg","14 December 2014","The good news that we have the brothers reunited and again working on circular narrative. Again, we have a powerful narrative arc that shifts in unexpected and engages in expected ways.The device is hackneyed: messages from the future, but is handled deftly. Where it is clumsy, we are competently distracted by narrative and visual process. The love story that drives this is novel enough to not fall into one of the three formulas commonly used for 'love,' (despite McConaughey) or two for father-rescues-daughter. We have a chosen child who saves the world by supernatural intervention, but again, this doesn't distract. These accomplishments alone make this worth experiencing because many devices are used to reset our expectations from formulas. Some fail horribly and that keeps this film from my absolute essential viewing list; I'll get to those in a moment. But all that are under the control of the filmmaker are so well considered that they bear mention.Take, for example the visual setting. The story itself is about the folding of time, but in a subtle way. The time of the story is in the future, but the setting is in the past. We refer to the dustbowl. All the cars, buildings, clothes and verbal expressions are vaguely from that era. We never see a brand that would pin down the time.More powerfully, the film itself is made as a science fiction film would be in the 50s-60s, using notions and tropes from that era. The robot is from ""Forbidden Planet."" The notion that a world-saving enterprise rests on the mathematical attempts of one man alone. That a vast enterprise is actually secret and located in one spot, with no suppliers. That construction of a spaceship requires welding sparks. That a heavy lift launch can occur in a building.Look at the computer screens. Nearly all are commandline interfaces. The switches and control panels are from the DEW line era. They haven't managed to use legacy fonts in the signage, but it looks like they avoided the most obvious: helvetica.Even the drone is a currently obsolete model. Underscoring all this is setting the film in Texas. Malick, and before him Bogdanovich, Hooper, Welles exploited the fact that Texas lives in two eras, sucking riches from the present while defining itself in some fictitious and better past.The film is also clearly in a future, after antiscience politicians have written technology out of the textbooks, denying the moon landing and forcing something named NASA underground. The ambiguity of time is conveyed subconsciously and works. I think they used some recorded interviews from the actual dustbowl era.But the flaw, the underlying decay in this film is in who they relied on for the science. They clearly separated the science of the adopted genre (noted above) from the science used in the actual extraterrestrial events. They chose renown physicist Kip Thorne as their authority.The man is an important scientist and reportedly very engaging. But the world of such scientists is divided between those who believe in the primary eminence of geometry and those who believe instead in ordered mechanics. This is a deep divide, highly polarized when the work gets going. Which is better for the problems at hand is irrelevant here. But which is better for cinematic depictions of encounters with the forces of the world well there is no contest and Noland chose unwisely. I may write about this. A good title may be the Carl Sagan effect.On other unrelated matters, some unresolved minor plot threads remain. The finished film exceeded the time budget for story-before-launch as it is, but we'd like to know what the reason for introducing the drone was and why it was important.A bit worse: In the film, we have a very hard won ability to send messages back in time, describing deep science from inside a black hole. I get that. But 'before' all those events, some other souls sent back messages and the physical artifact of the wormhole. Why not use that mechanism, unless the much-mentioned notion of the urges of love are essential to the bridge?","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8 November 2014","With Earth running out of resources, astronauts make a last-ditch attempt at locating other habitable planets within reach. This is possible via a wormhole, of unknown origin. And it *has* to work.At its core, this is about the love between a father, Coop(McConaughey, an everyday man with vital experience and a good team leader), and his daughter, Murph(Chastain, independent and as stubborn as he is). This is simultaneously its greatest strength and weakness. Everything we are excited about rides, to some extent, on us, and them, caring about both of them, and what they share. Thus, we never stop caring, and it enhances all the thrilling space adventures(almost exclusively grounded in reality, and the best theories), where the mastery of movement(or relative stillness) of the camera and the volume of the soundtrack(and sometimes deafening silence) builds tension to its breaking point, and, crucially, never beyond it. And unfortunately, this emotional grounding does eventually lead to some sappy sentimentalism.The ending will divide audiences. This owes a great, and openly acknowledged, debt to Kubrick's 2001, but it isn't a mere tribute to that, and to exploration of the stars and what that can bring, the latter of which it seeks to encourage a return to. It goes different places, and the third act will be long debated, as it deserves. The humor is well-integrated, not distracting and it eases us out of what would otherwise be relentless and unbearable heaviness. All of the effects are amazing, and the technology compelling. Watch this in the theater, it is made very much for that, as far as the visual and audible experience. The 2 hour and 45 minute running time, and that's not counting the closing credits, will scare some off, and it is perhaps too long.There is some disturbing content and a little moderate language in this. I recommend it to everyone who doesn't outright hate Nolan it is very much one of his films, for better as well as worse, however, even with the hokey aspects, this is one you shouldn't miss. 8/10","

"PostingandToasting","8 November 2014","Every generation of movie goers sees one film, maybe two, that changes the game for them. It becomes a signature moment that they remember years to come. They remember where they saw it, who they saw it with, even where they were sitting. Christopher Nolan has proved to be a film maker who works best with a big canvas, and he has never been given a canvas bigger than the one he used for his latest film, ""Interstellar"". I feel I can't even call going to see a Nolan piece a movie but more like an ""event"". For the average movie goer, they most likely aren't familiar with the directors of the films they're seeing but most know Nolan. Most know of Nolan because he has made some of the biggest, thrilling, and thought provoking films of the past decade from the Dark Knight trilogy to Inception.It's almost not worth trying to do a plot synopsis of ""Interstellar"" because it is difficult to try to condense the happenings in a film this huge because I know that I will leave out something big. Anyway, the film takes place in a potentially not-too-distant future where the earth has become unable to produce all but a few crops and it will get to a point where none will be able to grow and man will die out. In comes an engineer/pilot/father Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who is entrusted to be part of a space expedition to venture beyond a newly discovered wormhole to try and find a new planet capable of inhabiting the human race. Astronauts from previous missions have supposedly landed and have been sending signals for them to come.McConaughey has always had that ""movie star"" potential and I think this is the film that puts him in that title. This was a truly star making role due to the size of the film and I honestly believe he is the only man who could have done it. ""Interstellar"" was originally supposed to be done by Steven Spielberg before he dropped out and Nolan stepped in. Nolan, clearly influenced by past Spielberg films like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Jaws"", puts McConaughey in a role in the same vein as Richard Dreyfuss in ""Close Encounters"" or Roy Schneider in ""Jaws"". They needed an actor who could be looked at as an everyday guy who is experiencing incredible circumstances and McConaughey is able to display the emotion required for a man who has to drop everything, including his family whom he knows he may not see again, and try to save the human race. You can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice and your heart breaks and lifts with his simultaneously. This isn't necessarily a role that wins Oscars but it should be.The effects are obviously amazing. This, much like ""Gravity"" last year, is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen, especially in IMAX. This, along with the haunting score of frequent Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer, almost transports you to that necessary place that makes the events happening on screen seem possible. Kind of piggy backing off of that point, there will be those who will trash the film for ""the science isn't accurate"". Those comments are nonsense because no matter what ""science"" tells us, there is just no way for us to actually comprehend what is beyond a wormhole or what would happen if we attempted to go through one. Could we really transcend time and space? Would we discover new worlds and new civilizations? Impossible for us to say at this point, but what makes this film so great is that we are able to see the ideas of ""what can be"". It's the mystery of the unknown that both frightens and enthralls man and few films have been able to capture those feelings like ""Interstellar"" In a time where there are no more explorers, we're fortunate to be put in a position where we can feel what is like to discover and explore new worlds.People will remember ""Interstellar"" for either being a truly great film experience or ""not as good as 2001: A Space Odyssey"". This is one of most popular slights against the film so far as it is the closest thing to ""2001"" and defenders of the Kubrick classic will argue to the death that it doesn't live up to it. This is an argument that no one will win because it is a generational issue. People see these landmark films during their youth and they leave such an impression on them, that it almost becomes blasphemy to hear of another film made years later, rivaling the one they saw. People want to believe that the film from their time was the best and that no film will be able to capture those emotions they first felt and the memories that it created for them. I respect and detest this because I will most likely feel the same way when future space adventures in the same vein as ""Interstellar"" come out and I fear it is something that is out of my control. Much of the film circles around the idea that love is the one true thing that travels purely through time and space because it is that connection we feel with one another that makes us human and that can be applied with our love for certain films. The connection we feel with our favorite films is almost unshakable and those who think they can make us waver from those feelings are exercising in futility.In the end, ""Interstellar"" is one of those landmark films. It's a chance for us to escape reality and feel sense of adventure, hope, and amazement that rarely comes around. Don't miss it.","

"grumpy-3","10 November 2014","His 4th dud in a row, a ridiculous plot, for some reason the earth is reduced to only producing corn, so no animals, birds or fish, even though the scene by a lake the water looked clean and refreshing. Seems like humanity have forgotten that we can grow things in greenhouses and even underground. never mind lets move on, once again Nolan's characters all scientists and supposedly super intelligent do the most stupid things. anne hathaway goes in the water to retrieve a large piece of debris when a large wave appears, she has on hand a robot who could lift this wreckage with one hand but does not instruct him to do so, the beardy scientist is by the spacecraft door urging her to get a move on, the wave gets nearer the robot goes and carries her to the shuttle, the beardy scientist all this while stays put just outside the door and lets the wave carry him away, just one example of quite few.the biggest plot hole is this, for some reason once cooper is past the black hole and in 5 dimensional space, he becomes super intelligient, because he now knows how to solve the problem of gravity and save mankind, how he knows this we do not know, given that he is just an engineer to be able to figure out something the greatest physicists of the last hundred years cannot is unbelievable, he then sends probably the most complicated and long equation in history to his daughter in basic morse code, anyone familiar with morse code will tell you that this would take forever. now to the film making, others have mentioned its look , well to me it looked shabby, endless shots of aircraft wings, no vistas no shots of the galaxy or stars. during both the wormhole sequence and the black hole sequence he stays on the actors in close. in fact thank God i did not see this in imax, would have been a complete waste of time. and now the noise, with hans zimmer's worst and most bombastic score , added onto very loud sound effects, with the actors shouting to be heard we came a away with very bad headaches. the end did not make any sense at all. but we have the usual nolan fan base that cannot see past their noses all going ape over this and the usual batch of critics with no critical faculties whatsover.","

"tigerfish50","5 December 2014","'Memento' and 'Inception' had some problems, but their ideas stretched the imagination. 'Interstellar' only delivers the bombastic silliness one would expect if a puffed-up Batman director thought he could eclipse Kubrick's '2001' with a puerile adventure story. Christopher Nolan's new film begins badly and steadily declines as its long-winded prologue introduces the stereotypical elements of a Steven Spielberg/Norman Rockwell Sci-Fi co-production - a widowed ex-astronaut farmer, his chiseled jaw, a feisty daughter, a crusty grandpa, a dying Earth, dust storms, paranormal activity, baseball, cornfields - and lots of corn.After about an hour - which seems like two - a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity. Once they've journeyed through an intergalactic wormhole, the implausibility dimension expands to cosmic levels. Scientific hocus-pocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis, deranged astronauts, spaceship chases, time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy Hallmark-style climax. The visual effects are above average, but far short of awesome. When all is said and done, the film's self-importance and mawkishness leave one rooting for humanity's extinction.","

"sohylejain","8 November 2014","Bad-ass... is the adjective which I choose to type the first word of this review. As I left the theater I was not only spellbound, but I was also sulking about the fact that the movie had ended.The movie has a slow pace at the beginning, but not really boring. Steady and unique in its nature, I did feel that this movie might end up like last years blockbuster 'Gravity' starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. With every minute that passed, I could feel the importance of time, which let my prejudice drain away. With twists and turns, but not brain-spraining at all, it did make emotions come at par with adventure.Great acting by Matthew McConaughey did overshadow Anne Hathaway. With an epic storyline and Nolan's direction Space, Galaxy and the Universe did reach a whole new level.I would love to rate this movie 10 stars without a second thought because it reached the depth of my heart and left me speechless. This movie is not a movie which is meant to be wasted by watching it at your laptop or TV. It's buck worthy and a must watch for all the people who wait for some new serious, touching, heartwarming, adventurous, Science Fiction and Oscar deserving movies of all time. Hat's off to both the Nolans!","

"chaos-rampant","14 January 2015","The film outright fails for me, because it's about all the vital stuff in life, love, loss and new discovery as each one nested in the capacity of our minds for vision. But Nolan is a logician, a geometer who has to know everything in his narrative world in advance before he can construct it. So he doesn't get any of it in an intuitive way, an allusive way, a fluid way for appearances to suggest things.He cites Zerkalo as influence, next of course to 2001, a masterwork with an elusive logic, not wholly tractable, not complete, not causal, a spontaneous capacity for images and connections between them. But he does the opposite, 2001, something tractable, complete, causal, not spontaneous. Logical.(Cool tidbit. One of the great discoveries of the past century is a limit in formal logic that implies there's more that is true than provable in a given system, something that every aware creative person knows intuitively, axiomatically to be true. I like to think this is why Malick abandoned philosophy for the cinema, proof for expression. Flipped around it means that if you stick to what is strictly provable within your narrative you must miss out on some expressible truth.)This logic screams at me in one particular strand of plot, the ghostlike presence in the girl's bedroom, at first mysterious, but it's actually Nolan's way of creating the explanation of what he's going to do inside the black hole, which is his way of creating the metaphor about love as a powerful force. How? An actual force that transcends spacetime! (Btw, all that fuss about a renowned physicist assisting the production and they go ahead and film all that black hole stuff?)In other words the only way he can create metaphor is by having it be a plot device, so that the profundity of what happens to us must be accompanied by its narrative explanation; it only succeeds in reducing the intuitions we have (about love, connectedness etc). What's left is Nolan's own journey in space towards images that expand understanding. This would be his most ambitious so far. Does he do anything interesting? The Dustbowl interviews show he wanted a more grounded approach, a good idea to start among cornfields. Better action than before. But still unimaginative.A big indication for me was the scene after Coop wakes up from cryosleep and checks his messages from Earth; an entire life has gone by, and among all the possible images that Nolan could have put there to evoke that life, in a time when so much of our vision is mobile and we carry with us cameras everywhere (even more so in that near future), he gives us static monologues before a desk. The same teary tone. What a tragedy of inexpression! The mind at play here is like the spectral Coop trapped in that boxed space behind bookshelves and able to see only loops.Nolan gambled here of course, tried to elevate himself to more than contraptions; failed. It turns out he can only roar about that night which great filmmakers gently recall without explaining. Why this man is held in high esteem in a medium that should celebrate visual ability while a modern calligrapher like Shunji Iwai is an unknown says it.","

"Bento_de_Espinosa","30 January 2015","This is the movie that proves what many people by now have already realized: People are being payed to write 10 stars fake reviews! Let me tell you this: This movie is really NOT that great!First, it's too long. It takes one hour just for the space mission to start.It's slow paced and VERY sentimental, or, in other words, most of it is boring.I'm not an English native speaker, but my English is not bad either. I have no problems watching movies in English, and yet it was very hard for me to understand the main character's mumbling in his farmer accent. All other actors spoke properly, except him, the most important one.The plot is not very logical: Planets just in front of a giant black hole?! Yes, this must be the place to live everybody is dreaming of.Imagine your colleagues in the space station would say to you: ""OK, we're now ready to fly down to that planet. You wait here. Don't worry, we'll come back soon, in... some YEARS!"" You'd probably smile and say: ""Wonderful! OK, go now!"", right? One day they come back and are probably surprised to see you haven't committed suicide because of depression, even though you waited 23 years (!!!) for them. You must be the most patience man in the entire Universe.And again a female ""scientist"" who looks like a model and behaves like an amateur. An obligatory part of every sci-fi movie nowadays.This is just to give you an idea. There is much more, so read the other negative reviews.Good night. And good luck.","

"Mork_the_Borg","14 November 2014","This is weird... I love Science Fiction and I love astrophysics, but disliked everything about this movie. The start was extremely slow and it was hard to stay awake. The second half of the movie was somewhat better but felt like a very cheap rip-off of Space 2001. The movie just didn't do it for me at all and the acting was average. I'm totally flabbergasted that the average rating stands at 9 out of 10. Maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality, story-line, plot, acting, and uniqueness - as this movie doesn't have any of it. Ah well, I guess I'll just have to wait for the next SF movie and hope it will be somewhat better, because I am deeply disappointed by Interstellar as I expected so much more from a movie with an estimated budget of $165 million.","

What Christopher Nolan has done so good with this movie was that he kept the plot simple,but we know that it's Christopher Nolan so it not going to be a simple movie. It's not. The overall plot is that the earth is dying so cooper(Matthew mcconaughey) and a team of scientists must go and find another place to live. The acting is great,what makes it so great is cooper and his daughter. Every time they were together it was WOW. The visuals were on another level. If you can,see it on the biggest screen possible. Some people may not like this movie because it talks a lot about science and many other things but you enjoy that, you will have a blast with this.Overall interstellar is a must see.

"PWNYCNY","20 November 2014","A long, tedious movie. It attempts to be an epic but fails. It attempts to say something profound, but the message is garbled. The movie attempts to mix jumbled pseudo-scientific dialogue with a melodramatic subplot involving a father and daughter, producing a muddled story with little dramatic power. The movie contains elements from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Matrix, with its bombastic musical flourishes and the special effects meant to depict extra-dimensionality, all pure Hollywood. Matthew McConaughey is the principal actor; his character, Cooper, is the central figure of the story; the rest of the cast are supporting characters (their placement in the credits notwithstanding). McConaughey gives an interesting performance, which includes several scenes in which he weeps, which for a leading man is remarkable. The depiction of earth as a doomed planet is unconvincing and the plan to colonize other planets half-baked and one that tests the limits of plausibility. Being a science-fiction movie, stretching the boundaries of science for literary purposes is to be expected, but this movie asks the audience to accept certain premises that just do not make sense (e.g, acceleration of time; relationship of time to gravity; time as a material object). This movie is proof that when Hollywood attempts to deal with time warps, time holes, multi-dimensionality, relativity, and other complex scientific theories, the results can be less than optimum.","

"RIK-22","19 March 2015","As you can probably ascertain from my title sentence, I am not a fan of Mr Nolan. However I don't have any bias prior to watching his films, in fact quite the opposite, I want to like his films, as I really like his ideas and concepts, which is why it's such a shame he never delivers.I also seem to be in a minority with my views as his films seem to have mass appeal, certainly if you look at money they make, but so far, they have all left me cold.Interstellar, TDK and Inception all have similar flaws: On the positive side, they are all really cinematic, stylish and well filmed. They all have really atmospheric music and nice special effects.On the negative side, the plots are terrible and make no sense. The dialog is flat and unrealistic, there is no charisma or charm in the films, they are functional and soulless and they lack any real depth or meaning. The characters tend to be robotic and cold, not warm or humorous.The problem is when you put these two elements together you basically get high expectations that something great is going to happen, but ultimately nothing does, so it becomes a major let down.On to Interstellar specifically (warning spoilers a plenty): The first hour of the film, was very boring, and very silly. The Earth is running out of food, so people still plant huge fields of crops, which they destroy when driving through them for no good reason. They have completely automated the process of farming crops, yet they don't need Scientists or Engineers, they need farmers, which makes no sense.If the Earth was starving then the crop fields would be fenced off, taken away from farmers and it would be a controlled process. Scientists and Engineers would be the most valued members of society. If the crops were so valuable they wouldn't be exposed to the elements and the dust. They would be covered and protected. Everyone is so worried about the food shortages, they don't take any notice of it. Instead they drive around in huge petrol driven SUV's from 2014 (where's the Google cars or electric cars?).Here's an idea. You now have the ability to hibernate on spaceships, so apply that to the population of Earth and reduce the need for food. Anyway let's move on.They go into space, arrive at some place and immediately land in some water. Do they survey the area first, check out the planet and landing area first in detail, nope they just land. Now I know there is time pressure, but why haven't NASA sent numerous robots into space to visit these planets and send back information.Anyway this drags on a bit, they visit another place, which is another disaster and then we get to the point of the film (only after about 2 and a half hours). Cooper flies into a black hole, where he would normally be crushed and killed instantly, but survives in some kind of advanced framework, where he very predictably sends the already sent messages back to his daughter. After this there is a very silly ending. Even though he is outside of time, as it were and he can send messages to any point, he can't for some reason stay in the same time as his daughterAnd how stupid was the 1970's Minecraft designed robot.In the end the visuals and atmospheric music was great, but the plot, soul and charm of the film was completely missing, unfortunately like all Nolan movies.","

"Shilo_R_A","24 June 2023","""Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends time and space.""Void. Then, as the monologue continues, the void is filled with cringe. ""Oh, Nolan"", I think to myself. ""Will you ever be able not to take gigantic resources as means to tell over-complicated, spectacle-centered stories that lack emotion?"". But of course, these thoughts probably won't reach Nolan anytime soon, and my internal monologue will only be shared with you guys. Let's get into it.Interstellar is a 2014 film, directed by the beloved and critically acclaimed Christopher Nolan. The movie follows a group of astronauts on a race against time to save humanity from extinction, looking for a new home planet for our race. Apropos a race against time, time has a lot of meaning in this film - a foreboding, looming presence that you fight against, a sacrifice you make, your one-way ticket to the end of everything you know. At least, this is what the film is trying to communicate.Nolan, who has delivered great material in the past (as of the time I'm writing this review, Memento is in my top 15 films of all time) but also lacking-in-emotion, over-complicated stuff (The Prestige being a prime example of that, and I think I might've been a little soft giving score to this film). I recommend reading my review to The Prestige for more insight about the way Nolan approaches cinema, but in short, I think that Nolan's biggest problem is looking at cinema as if it was a magic trick, as if the only thing that matters is to surprise and amaze. His way of doing that is turning to spectacles, to complicated concepts with cool visuals, but by doing so he often compromises the emotional aspect of the film, and the flow of the story, too.In this case, I feel like most aspects of the film are just okay, just there to support those massive moments regarding time and space. The amount of work going into some of the visuals is truly magnificent, but I feel like I can't be moved by this film, not really. The characters are far from being three dimensional or interesting, only managing to be just a little above the bare minimum needed to sustain the plot. The dialogue is nothing more than okay - decent at its best moments, cringe-worthy at its worst.I mean, the only thing truly working here is the film's way with the most epic moments of the story, the moments that make you feel how powerless, how small humans are in comparison to the universe in general. I'll also admit that the pacing felt much worse on first watch, when so much of the film went on and on about scientific terms and laws of physics (the dialogue felt super forced here) and then tried to push this half-baked philosophy about the importance of love (which was forced, too, and definitely felt like Nolan's poor attempt in finding an excuse to this film's concept) that I felt like it just crawled sometimes. On rewatch you know what to expect, and I could let myself enjoy the more fun moments, the grand moments, easing into the spectacle as much as I could.Still - spectacle doesn't compensate for the dryness of anything else. This is maybe to worst thing about this film - it thinks it's deep or smart when it isn't, not at all. The grandest moments work best, the ""philosophical"" moments or the moments in which the film tries to outsmart the viewer...well, this is Nolan's biggest weakness as a director. It's not horrible, but it's disappointing in its utter mediocrity. I'm feeling a 5.7/10 on this one.","

Interstellar doesn't offer anything new as such.If you put the movie Gravity and the movie Frequency together in 5D, wormhole angle, you have Intersetllar.In fact I found Frequency to be highly underrated movie.Acting/Direction is good but wished the script were much more stronger.","

"aldamayo","4 November 2014","So last night I got the chance to see the early screening of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. The film I've been waiting so much from the early days of the shooting. How did it fare? Here's my take:To avoid any tl;dr risk, let me get this straight from the very beginning, Interstellar is one goddamnedly good film, it gets you to the edge of your seat, it soars, it warps, it rips your brain senseless. It's that good.Interstellar is a story about the earth dying, with its soil no longer able to sustain crops other than corn, and of course, it will lead to the extinction of humanity. Our hero is an ex-NASA test pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a typical ordinary-guy-in-an-extraordinary- situation everyman who's also a dedicated family man, especially toward his daughter Murphy (named after the Murphy's Law). In an all-too-Armageddon style our hero gets invited by the (publicly) defunct NASA to become humanity's last hope in finding a new home, for they have found a wormhole near Saturn (2001, anyone?) which will warp the astronauts to another galaxy in quest of a habitable planet. Solid and compact premise, although it's been used before.For seasoned filmgoers, there are many similar elements (although it's understandable) with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). In a sense that this is not a bang-bang-shoot-shoot-blow-em-up sci-fi, but more of a slow-burning, metaphysical sci-fi which gets you to think about your place in the universe and your exact place in time.Similarity with 2001 and Contact is never a bad thing, but it becomes a wee bit too predictable, although Nolan is a smart enough director in providing the final (a very sentimental one, I should say) twist in the story. The visuals in this film is majestic, everything is shot to a meticulously calculated level, Nolan-style. The space scenes are serenely suspenseful just like Cuaron's Gravity, but unlike the documentary feel of Gravity, there's a real gusto and pace to these scenes. You should also be prepared for the (for some, maybe) unexpected third act, it is Nolan's most sentimental and humane moment to date. And this is why Interstellar is more than just a science-fiction, it is a human drama intertwined in space and time loop.One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released.After watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown.Because sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us.","

"BA_Harrison","10 November 2014","As directed by Christopher Nolan, he of the pretentious, derivative, mind-bending crap-fest that was Inception and the vastly over-rated Dark Knight trilogy, I fully expected Interstellar to have plot holes you could pilot a space station through—and, with a whopping running time of 169 minutes, I figured staying awake would be a task almost as gargantuan as the film's black hole (which is actually called Gargantua—that's just how gargantuan it is!!!).Sure enough, the preposterous pseudo-scientific plot can be picked apart with ease, but the film itself is something of an anomaly: although it is a grossly indulgent pile of pretentious hooey that stretches plausibility to breaking point, I found myself entertained throughout. Interstellar is so far up itself that it actually transcends all the laws of cinema and proves to be a rather enjoyable piece of big-budget baloney as a result.For starters, we get Matthew McConaughey's farmer Cooper, who is chosen to pilot NASA's only spacecraft, despite having spent the last decade or so growing corn. Then we get two of science-fiction's most aesthetically awkward robots in the form of A.I. units TARS and CASE. After flying through a worm-hole, Cooper lands his spacecraft in several inches of water and then surfs a massive tidal wave. We see a planet so cold that its clouds are solid ice. We have a mad scientist who rants about the human instinct for survival while head butting Cooper with his space helmet. Although Michael Caine's character spans 23 years, he doesn't look a day older than when we first see him (his voice just gets a bit hoarse, but not Batman hoarse). And Cooper enters a black hole where he ends up behind a 5-dimensional bookcase that allows him to manipulate gravity to send a message to his daughter via wristwatch!!!And that's just the stuff I can recall right now (it's waaay past my bed-time and I'm very tired).If only there had been a few ninjas, some gratuitous female nudity (perhaps a race of insatiable, sexy alien maidens with over-sized breasts), a planet of space zombies, and a laser battle, this would have been the perfect so-bad-it's-good movie.7/10: it's too wonderfully silly for me too hate on it as much as I really should.","

"craig-340-777546","20 May 2015","You would think the story is adventurous, exciting, beautiful! Its not at all what I had hoped. It is slow, dark as a black hole, loud as an old Barton Theater Organ playing Fugue in D Minor interesting as a litter box. The story is thin.....I can't blame the actors, the entire plot is pretty simple. Can't inhabit earth, find somewhere else to live. Interstellar is a repeat of time continuum stories you have heard or seen before, I wont spoil it, but it's all been told before. Dialog is dreary, slow, ponderous. The comparison to 2001 is preposterous. The wonder and awe of 2001 and other movies before it was it had never been done it was the first. 2001 was all done without the advanced technology we have in computer imagery we have today. 2001 was a pioneering effort. This is not at all pioneering, inventive or surprising if you read science fiction at all. The imagery is not all that unique or impressive. The constant thumping and droning of background music was mind numbing. Most of the show I was trying to nod off, but for the LOUD THEATER ORGAN playing in the background I probably would have. I have to agree with some of the reviewers who thought the whole show was ridiculous and in some ways they are right. Somehow science has advanced enough to create interstellar space travel but not far enough to build power cells, clean power, they are still burning fossil fuels. The robots are Lego like, silly looking clunks of stainless steel....it is all so ridiculous. I would not call this HORRIBLE or AWFUL I have seen some real stinkers over the years. Interstellar is not so ridiculous it is a parody of a good movie it is just not a great movie some had hoped it to be.","

"AlsExGal","12 August 2018","This is a good sci-fi tale, if you can manage to sit for almost 3 hours, about a mission to save the planet from some disaster (either global warming, dust bowls, or whoever wins the next presidential election). Matthew McConaughey heads the mission, along with Anne Hathaway and a few others I hadn't seen before. They also have a neat robot named TARS. They fly off to find some previous scientists, who have entered a black hole and settled on several worlds possible for human habitation. Matt Damon plays one of the scientists.You have to like black holes, relativity, and the fifth dimension (not the pop group) to appreciate this. I didn't know a thing about this film beforehand, so it was a nice surprise to see Michael Caine pop up. And when William Devane showed up, I instinctively blurted out ""What's in your safe?""The special effects are fine, but the characters are more interesting, and you do want to see how the situations get resolved. McConaughey is good, but he mumbles on occasion, which drives me nuts. I liked the music score, but at times it drowned out the actors.","

"greebo-01548","20 March 2022","The premise here is relativity. Time vs gravity. The story, if there is one, is pointless. Christopher Nolan has surpassed Stanley Kubrick in making a visually stunning but ultimately pointless piece of Sci Fi nonsense. Nobody can give me a convincing explanation of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but in 1968 it was jaw dropping. Interstellar's problem is we've seen it all before, and Nolan is not Kubrick.Perhaps there is an analogy of the futility of life here, but it's spurious at best.This ranks with Prometheus as an incredibly beautiful waste of my time.","

"BlokeWithABrainUK","21 November 2014","OK, I'll keep this brief, but I'll also nail my credentials to the mast first. I know science, cosmology, sci-fi and film-making pretty well. I have, in the past taught film studies at degree level, and worked on the production of more than one major Hollywood sci-fi film. I read Stephen Baxter and I like space stuff a lot. More than a lot. And why am I telling you this? Because I should have loved ""Interstellar"", but I didn't for one simple reason: It is a truly dreadful piece of film-making.I won't even bother with dissecting the ""science"" in the film, because that isn't really the issue (it is wrong on pretty much every level). I'm not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix. And I'll ignore the sub-standard special effects - because FX don't a great movie make.The issues I have with Interstellar are essentially these: The film is an arse-numbing three hours long, and feels far longer. The pace is stunningly poorly judged - the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost.The characters are paper-thin, and I didn't care about any of them. The plot is entirely derivative (mostly of the vastly superior ""Contact""). The special effects aren't special at all and the editing (or lack of) is so self-indulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity. The result is a plodding, flabby, and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact.I won't go on, but special mention must be made of the planets - Paddling World and Coldworld. You see virtually nothing of either, and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor CGI painfully inferior to ""A Perfect Storm"" and a location less dramatic than your own back garden.I've probably not been a brief as I intended, but as I write this I feel the disappointment and actual anger I felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again. It was a total let-down and a waste of more than three hours of my life. The gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd, and I am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me, or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by. I am fairly confident I didn't doze off, although I desperately wanted to.So in conclusion, ""Contact"" did all of this far, far better, fifteen years ago. In Contact the characters are human, believable, beautifully realised and you care what happens to them. The relationship between Father and Daughter is deeply moving and inspiring. But then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway, dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life, the science is accurate and entirely plausible (it was written by Carl Sagan after all), the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle, and it has something very profound to say.Contact is everything Interstellar is not, and it has a considerably shorter running time. Contact brought tears to my eyes, Interstellar bored me to tears.","

"deschreiber","21 November 2014","First, about the pain, which is mostly due to the sound. I don't know how many times we're in a rocket ship blasting off somewhere with everything shaking, the cameras jiggling, the astronauts grimacing, and the sound track roaring, screeching, thundering, blasting the eardrums—I really did have to plug my ears by the end of the movie. Add to that the so- called music, which consisted mostly of even higher mountains of noise, mostly produced by a big pipe organ pumping out its gargantuan decibels in the form of a few simple chords—hardly music, merely a musical instrument adding to the overall accumulation of noise. I don't think anybody should be credited with creating ""music"" for this film.As for the stupidity, I was lured into the theatre by publicity claiming that the film had got the science right, or at least the graphic representation of a wormhole and black hole. Well, the graphics may have been right, but they were pretty standard stuff as far as eye candy goes, hardly worth the price of the ticket. What about the science? Maybe it was correct on every point, or on most points, or only on a few points—who knows? Only someone with degrees in quantum mechanics and astrophysics would be able to judge. For the general audience (obviously, the audience the film was aimed at), the science talk came across as sheer gobbledygook. There was no effort to explain the ideas for the public. The jargon was just spat out here and there with the purpose of raising a smokescreen for the current plot point. Very annoying.I wanted to enjoy this film. I hated not liking it, knowing how much money and effort went into making it. But by the time we got to the last 20 minutes or so, I'd had enough and had to fight the urge to walk out. In fact, I did get out of my seat and watched the last 10 minutes or so from the back of the auditorium near the exit door.","

If you did not;then rent or buy 2001 and avoid this piece of crap.""INTERSTELLAR"" is a dumb and lazy written cash cow disguised as a philosophical statement. ""INCEPTION"" was the same thing (but less stupid and more entertaining or at least had more action and violence ) Do not be fooled by the concept; there are just one or two interested statements in this movie but taking three hours for that is excessive.The whole things must make sense in Nolan's depressing mind; the world is ending but people is still selfish enough to make matters worse. The movie has zero humor and the positive or hopeful message is as fake as the special effects.In fact; this is a movie about God; but Nolan's refuse to even refer about religion; so the movie is about ""something"" that is never clear and makes absolutely no sense. ***SPOILER AHEAD*** Without saying too much about the first ending (there is a second happy ending to ensure better box office receipts and is even more absurd ) why whoever could create such a device just pass the message and solve the problem ?. ***END OF SPOILER***McConaughey is talk is almost incomprehensible. Anne Hathaway is always good; but his character is under written. Jessica Chastain has to deal a completely absurd and unbelievable and over dramatized situations (and she does not succeed).In brief; do not commit the same error I made. Save your money for a better and more sincere money; this one is just a scam.","

It's not a simple movie, maybe that was already clear, is a Nolan's film.Matthew McConaughey does a great job by portraying Cooper. The most touching scenes are those between his character and Mackenzie Foy, who plays the younger version of Murph, Jessica Chastain character. Either it seems to be an ""Outer Space Film"" is more about human relations and how important is for us to be linked with others. Even it's a long movie, 169 minutes, I didn't felt it that long or tedious. The director managed to keep us engaged through the whole film. The experience on IMAX in 70mm film. The image quality perceived was superb, now I get why Christopher Nolan and other directors are fighting to keep film alive. I had the opportunity to watch it at the Chinese theatre and was a great experience, my first time in that theatre. The staff from the theatre even told us that Nolan himself watched several scenes of the movie in that theatre to ""calibrate"" the experience. Which is very cool. Well, I encourage you to go and watch Interstellar to see of you love or hate it.","

"voyou-703-655350","17 November 2014","The plot is pretty standard, nothing new at all if you've read enough SF classics. The male cast is good, the adult female cast is awful, a small number of scenes are impressive, the so-called music reminisces of chalk on a blackboard, but all that doesn't matter because...YOU CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING WHEN PEOPLE TALK. Hum, sorry, I was saying that the sound department was run by either a deaf or retarded person. And so is Mr Nolan, who possibly didn't bother checking his final product. The thing that passes for music is that loud. Reading lips sometimes help, but half the talking is through radio anyway, so good luck with that.That's when I realise that Nolan can't actually tell a story through pictures. In many scenes, what is shown is severely shifted from what should be seen, and I would really need the dialogue to explain what is happening, but I can't decipher it because, you know, idiots at the helm. In the same vein, there are quite a lot of inconsistencies and silly concepts. And maybe the writer did come up with acceptable vocal explanations, but I'll never know, because a monkey spilled the background soundtrack all over the track I wanted to hear, and nobody cleaned it up.During the projection, I was seriously and increasingly getting angry at the technical lousiness. That's a first. Hollowood has reached new levels of incompetence.Save your time and money for something made by caring professionals.","

This is by no means 2001: A Space Odyssey just as Nolan is no Kubrick, but the movie is ambitious and does have strong points. There are a lot of things that make no sense however, first, the nature of the Apocalypse on Earth is completely nonsensical, but on the other side, the oft criticized ending by the scientifically illi terate, makes much more sense than a lot of otherwise blindly accepted parts, especially if you take into account that once you go speculative, you cannot be that wrong. There is some sound strong sci-fi along the way, but a lot of nonsense points have to be given too, though many are saved by the (almost) brilliantly consistent ending, and a lot of sci-fi themes are nicely incorporated and shown, to stimulate imagination in some capable kids.There is also a strong extra point given for respect of the father, as single fatherhood is vastly underappreciated in the wok esick culture of nowaday. The daughter ""scientist"" is celebrated despite of the fact that she entirely plagiarizes work of future generations transmitted by her daddy, which is taken as her modest denial in a culture desperate but unable to obtain wok ef reindly heroines of disciplines for which for many centuries including decades of ins ane positive dis krimination they are proven to be a bit too soft in the head for, a touche, if subtle punch that irritated the ""critics"". Extra point for Matt Damon playing a nas ty man he always seemed to me to be.Overall, a flawed but inspiring piece that can stimulate imagination and scientific curiosity in those who have it, and some emotional roller coaster for the dimw it majority.","

However, all the science leading up to the adventure of going to different galaxies seemed to be a lot of mumbo-jumbo...lots of theories and big words to confuse the audience so that we think it could be possible.The last thirty minutes almost was incomprehensible...the explanations of what happened in the earlier part of the film didn't make sense...but because it was explained with a serious voice talking and serious music behind it, people who don't understand quantum physics (which are most of us) will think it does.Plese Hollywood, reign in Christopher Nolen a bit.","

"MorpheusOne","24 July 2021","This movie had such an expansive amount of hype behind it...how could anything go wrong?!(Cue the Blair Witch Project soundtrack...)By no means was this was the worst movie that I have ever seen, that's definitive; there were, however, a few things about the film that don't make much sense! Perhaps the most obvious among them was WTF was Mann trying to accomplish in his apparent death spiral desire to condemn all life on Earth?! He knew that the mathematics behind 'Plan A' was a fraud; so, he...obviously...believed that returning to Earth was no option. This means that it was his understanding that finding a planet suitable for life, from 'an Earth perspective', was the only viable option. Yet, he knew\believed that the ice planet that he landed on was not suitable for life, faking the data. So, why fake the data?? Would doing so enhance the likelihood of him being rescued? Presumably, yes, since he was transmitting the fake favorable data in hopes that someone would arrive & save him. Yet, he prevented them from doing anything on his world...obviously...because he knew they would uncover his deception. So, given that, what was the plan!? To condemn all life on Earth?! Granted, maybe that's the whole point of that story arc; he was insane. Which is, I believe, rather ironic; that 'death spiral', specifically due to the action of that scene, was, I think, the best scene in the entire film.Something overlooked by, at least, virtually everyone that saw this film, no doubt about it, is: Did the scientists on Earth see the blackhole, ""Gargantuan"", on the Earth-side of the wormhole, obviously, 'before' sending the astronauts through the wormhole, including the 12 sent through initially? It is implied that they did; but, ..& someone, please, correct me if I am wrong, ..no where throughout the first hour, or so, of the film did they bother to mention that blackhole that's on the other side of the wormhole, in that 'galaxy far, far away...' They talked about the 'wormhole'; not the blackhole! If they knew about the blackhole early enough, this, reasonably, may have changed their game-plan. Further, why go down to that planet, in orbit around the blackhole, when the risk of failure is so high, let alone actually retrieving data that is worth the risk of going down to that planet is so excruciatingly, 'astronomically' and exponentially low¿? Especially given the reality that said planet is completely inhospitable...given its close proximity to a blackhole¡!¡ For cryin' out loud, they'd be better off sending down a probe, at least at first, on the same quicker trajectory that they took to get to the planet, to determine if the data can be retrieved; & the data could reasonably be retrieved with just a probe, anyway! And if the time dilation makes all of that not viable, then, it is damn sure not worth sending people down there! It is a story arc that, in theory, sounds great 'script-wise'; because, it adds emotional turmoil for the characters to go through & experience &, therefore, tension & drama for the viewer - yet, it just doesn't honestly work. You see this as a person just watching the movie.I actually feel sorry for Getty, from ""That 70's Show""; while the character is not useless, it is a weak character, entirely because of how the character was introduced, & Topher Grace, as an accomplished actor, deserves better than that. It actually made sense for that character to be a doctor working for/at NASA/NORAD, at the compound, perhaps as the physician working directly with Professor Brand...File that under "" *Duh!* ""; seriously, put that into the '"" *Duh!* "" File'!Obviously, this was a much better way to introduce that character. And, obviously, they chose to not do this; they introduced the character in, pretty much, the worst way possible; dropping him in out of no where, like he fell out of the sky - literally, ..as an after-thought! This was an absolute hatchet job and, undeniably, is the worst thing about the entire film. And, of course, there's the gratuitously predictable 'Tom', a character as devoid of a legitimate reason to exist as any such character has ever existed in the history of cinema! I am actually surprised that they didn't make him an addict of some sort; why not just poor on the vulgar borishness like it's pancake syrup!¿?!And, finally, (astronaut) Brand had a much greater chance of getting back to ""Sol""/""Terra"", our Solar System, than Cooper 'the guy who fell into a black hole...'... But, they can't allow the hero to FAIL; so, they have them accomplish the completely impossible. And the 'Tesseract Scene' is awesome; it looks very cool. However, it only made sense in a 'goofy romanticized sort of way', i.e., 'script-wise', that Cooper was 'the ghost' who started it all... And although there may have been no truly good way, at least none that they were able to think of (Although, did they even try!?), to depict it cinematically, I would love to have seen something of the 5th Dimension beings who made it all possible. When Cooper said that 'we' were them, i.e., ""...they're not beings, they're us."", i.e., that humans are the 5th Dimension beings, that's just more romanticized BS.Overall, the worst thing about this movie is the directing, by far! This movie actually made me lose some degree of respect for Christopher Nolan.","

"ghost_dog86","13 November 2014","There are moments during ""Interstellar"" which may be compared to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (a better movie). There are moments during ""Interstellar"" which may be compared to ""Prometheus"" (also, a better movie). There are even moments and storytelling techniques within ""Interstellar"" that are completely ripped off from ""Inception"" (a much better movie, from Christopher Nolan himself). That said, ""Interstellar"" should still be touted as the most ambitious film of the year so far, and in the same breath, should ultimately go down as one of director Christopher Nolan's worst films to date.This highly anticipated Nolan project depicts a future riddled with dust storms, where the world's food supply is nearly depleted (or at least 40 to 60 years out from being depleted, but that doesn't sound nearly as dire) where astronauts are working as farmers and children are taught that the Apollo space missions were faked. During this time, an underground government institution called NASA commissions a group of astronauts (including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway) for a top secret space mission. This mission will have them traveling through a newly discovered wormhole, with the promise of finding another inhabitable world.OK, let's get right to it. Any praise I heap upon this movie will be directed at the final 90 minutes of this two hour and 49 minute long film, since the first 80 or so minutes of ""Interstellar"" (while absolutely gorgeous at times to behold) is drenched in sequences of McConaughey seemingly reenacting moments from those pretentious Lincoln car ads, caught in a continuous and almost finger wagging diatribe about how the human race was never meant to die on earth, which nearly put me to sleep. In other words, the first half of this is as slow and lifeless as watching a dead astronaut drift through space. Anyway, this is Intersellar's fatal flaw, since the latter half is ripe with big budget yet very symbolic action sequences, stunning cinematography and fascinating talking points dealing with the nature of human survival in the face of an unsympathetic universe, due to some really insightful slabs of dialogue from a script written by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan. Even the literal rocket science lingo becomes more and more palatable as the ""gravity"" of this plot begins to set in, near the midpoint of Act 2.Final Thought/The Ending: Allow me to take a quick spoiler free moment to discuss this ending. During the final act of ""Interstellar"", for most film nerds, Nolan's story will be encroaching on the hallowed grounds of Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Some will admire the sheer ballsyness of what he does in this pivotal moment and others will find it in bad taste. Though this is not a huge issue, since I don't believe this niche group will have much effect on ticket sales, the problem is that for the millions who didn't see ""Interstellar"" for any film school aesthetic reason, Nolan's ending will simply come off as so strange and obnoxiously far-fetched, that many may leave the theater angry that the punch-line wasn't worth the nearly three hour set up.","

"grantss","24 November 2014","An epic science fiction movie. Not just epic due to its running time - about 2 3/4 hours - but also due to its physical scale and the boldness of its concepts. Christopher Nolan has shaped a movie that tackles some fairly complex astrophysical issues, and carried it off with aplomb.Fantastic special effects, a clever plot and decent performances by an all-star cast.Not perfect though. The sci fi parts are great but the relationship / human drama stuff seems clumsy at times. The scene setting at the beginning seems to take forever. We all know the really good stuff - the space scenes - are coming at some stage but Nolan draws out the more mundane earth stuff. Plus, there are scenes and plot detours which feel unnecessary, and periods where the movie seems to drift. The Matt Damon sub-plot just felt like padding. Some of the seemingly unnecessary, overly contrived or implausible things do ultimately have a purpose.

"vincent-27","31 December 2018","Some directors can pull of the feat of writing and directing, Tarantino comes to mind. PT Anderson is another. Even though this was co-written between Christopher Nolan and his brother, the Coens they are not!This movies is a perfect example of how making a movie (as my amateur film maker friend put it) is like building a cathedral. Being good at making stain glass does not make you a good brick layer, and that task is best left to ones who know what they are doing. To whit, we have this monstrous piece of pretentious drivel which attempts, as so many big hollywood movies do, to gloss over hastily written sequences with flash and bombast. This is another movie that feels like it was written by a committee of executives who were barely aware of the history of film and watched a couple of youtube videos on The Grand Unified Theory and tried to write something all smart-like. This movie is so scattered and convoluted it's hard to begin, and many other reviewers have pointed a lot of the plot elements that are glossed over with yet another ""yeah, that happened, deal with it"". Here are some of the things that I audibly groaned over:Why not explain what happened to Earth when every other part of this movie is explained like the audience is 5 years old?If the technology is available to build spacecraft with cryogen chambers, how about producing new forms of food? Lab grown meat for example? Hydroponic greenhouses etc?Why are the robots basically mechanical jenga pieces? How does that design make sense? The robot REALLY bothered me, especially how there was absolutely no effort to actually make it sound like a robot, it basically sounded like exactly what it was, which most of the time was just a guy inside a cheap plastic box. His voice didn't even sound like it was coming out of a speaker. HAL sounded like a person, but still had a creepy quality to him that sounded vaguely artificial (""what a moment, wait a moment"").And then there is the idea that you could actually get anywhere near a black hole (let alone wormhole) with relatively recent technology and survive. I have a rudimentary understanding of physics, but even I know that the radiation would turn you into goo pretty fast, space suit or no space suit.And a guy waits in a spaceship for 23 years by himself and doesn't go insane and looks basically the same except for a few grey hairs in his beard? I could go on and on....This movie tries really, really hard, there is a lot of balling actors showing off their chops and trusting that they are making a masterpiece, which I imagine every actor must do, but alas there is no saving this movie. It tried too hard to be all things, part 2001: A Space Odyssey, part Armageddon, part Inception and fails on all counts. Everything about this movies hints at greatness, the effects, the Phillip Glass like score written by Hans Zimmer, the tears swelling up at climactic scenes, but it is all empty packing around a bad story. This movie is a shiny car with hamsters on a wheel as the engine.One positive outcome of this movie is that it has reminded me to read about physics out of interest, but not to discuss them like I know anything, as I will come across as pretentious as this movie.I suggest everyone watches 2001 to cleanse their pallet and to be reminded of what truly great film making is about.","

"bryno92","3 November 2015","Was this movie terrible? No, but for as much praise as it got, I'm astounded. The plot was ridiculous and unbelievable. That isn't what killed the movie however, it was the acting! Maybe the director wanted the actors to act that way, but every time they did something amazing, they barely acted surprised. It was as if it was all in a days work. This is the sole reason why I can't get myself to re- watch this movie. The visuals were amazing, but I'm more interested in plot lines and character development than pretty effects (call me old school, even though I'm in my 20's). The movie tries to be like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but falls short. 2 months after watching Interstellar, not much is retained in my memory (I had to re-read the ridiculous plot and re-watch a trailer to bring my memory back). Whereas 2001 I watched 6 or so months ago and remember most of it. It may seem like I'm calling this movie terrible, it's not. It's just highly overrated and I need to point out the flaws that keep this from being a masterpiece. Maybe I've seen too many programs about space (Cosmos, The Universe, 2001, etc) that keep this movie from stunning me with the visuals, but if you're a person that has not seen too many space programs, you'd probably like it. And just an FYI, this is coming from a guy that hated Gravity and Inception. If you like those, you may like this movie.","

"baberchik","13 November 2014","I am wondering if the people who write ""intertstellar"" 10-star reviews are actually sane, or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely deprived of everything that is sci-fi. Basically if the sic-fi component - most of which does not really happen until the end - is removed from the plot the movie by and large is a classic Hollywood soap opera. The worn-out rag of cliché family relations, all- American-dad, ""complicated"" love affair, unruly and a classic tomboy-girl, co-workers (more like co-idiots) who rebel and despite all common sense act irrationally, you know, to ""up the ante""... it really makes up 90% of this movie. Up until half- way trough I honestly considered walking away from this boring tragedy which is the lack of creative talent on the part of the script writers and director. There are also very obvious holes in the plot, and not just irregularities but direct contradictions that even the most obnoxious sic-fi movies at least try to amend somehow.I can not help but think that after watching Automata which was a breath of fresh air in many regards, this movie is like walking into a small toilet where someone just took a huge dump. It is literally that bad. What saves this movie by the skin of its teeth is the ending. So just watch that instead, because until then you could have just as well been watching an episode of Santa Barbara.Spolers about ridiculous plot holes (as if the soap part of the movie is not stressed enough): 1) The stupid Dust Bowl recycled. Seriously? I am not even going to try to explain this because I'd need to re-post have of Wikipedia here, but it does not work that way. Not in the past - not in the future. 2) The moment NASA abducts the main character and daughter and questions them. Seriously? Maybe they should also have shot them on sight? 3) NASA's facility is top secret! Right... in the age supposedly after the present, when there are drones and google maps, they manage to hide a huge facility in some old James Bond villain fashion. 4) ""LET'S GO TO ANOTHER GALAXY!"". OK if the movie shows a fairly conventional rocket, carrying a futuristic ""shuttle"", WHY for the love of all holy would anyone risk going there - instead of looking in our own? What, they really expected to have better luck there - than in our own? They already searched the entire Milky Way? And what's even better - it ""just so happens"" there is a planet like a stone's throw away from the black hole and is NOT being consumed by it, and somehow a black hole which is now proved to be a collapsed star is anything BUT a collapsed star? Why... let's just start diving down toilets, because you know, they are not full of s*** but are actual doorways to different dimensions! Like dimensions of dementia perhaps! 5) Saving the best for last - I did like the ending. Despite its absurdity I did like it. Almost cried - if I were a 14 year old girl with especially fragile psychology, but I digress. The ""machine"" that allows the main character to conviniently contact his daughter in the future- past, is built by... the very humanity he is trying to save, that survived, and built the machine in the future. Lord have mercy, I will try to explain this... So basically if we consider all major theories about time travel, in order to change the future one must go there and change it, right? But here the future changes the past, and that past is what changed the future with the help of the future that is changed in the past with the changed future's help. Mind >>> blown!","

"Deathstryke","10 November 2014","""Interstellar"" pretends to be more intelligent than Alfonso Cuarón's audio-visual roller coaster, ""Gravity"", but ironically its best moments are those which, like Gravity, rely purely on thrill and spectacle.For the rest of the film we are crammed into a tiny shuttle with McConaughey and his crew, or back on earth with the desperate remnants of human civilization as they attempt to solve the problem of starvation. Most of the dialogue consists of reams and reams of contrived quantum-physics babble, which, if you're like me, will whoosh straight over your head like those exposition sequences in CSI, with brief moments of levity provided by the two -weirdly cubic looking- robots TARS and CASE.Their journey to find another habitable planet is marred by a sequence of seemingly insurmountable problems that become progressively so ludicrous, it ends up impossible to take them seriously, albeit exciting to watch.We already have to stretch our disbelief past the opening premise that the world is dying because of crop blight, yet they've managed to build robots that have human intelligence and can adapt a variety of shapes to achieve a wide range of tasks. One wonders why humans at this level of technological advancement couldn't have found a solution to curbing this unexplained blight other than blasting off into a foreign galaxy to try and populate a mysterious planet neighboring a black hole.Glaring plot issues aside (and there are many), the film is at its best when in full space simulator mode and the audience is being catapulted into the roaring white light of a black hole, accompanied by Hans Zimmer's electrifying score (props to Zimmer for once NOT composing something that sounded exactly like Pirates of The Caribbean), making full use of the IMAX experience.Performances are fairly solid, in particular Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph, and there is enough raw emotion on show to push some of the more logically questionable moments past your cynic meter and give a sense of weight and importance to what is happening, even if you can't quite understand it.Definitely worth watching on the big screen, but would I give it a 9/10? No way. This is a film that you will enjoy on face value, but once you leave the cinema you will start picking it to shreds. There are just too many inconsistencies, contrivances and blatant stupidity in the plot to call this a masterpiece, but I'd give it a solid 7 for blockbuster entertainment value.","

"Vishnu_nair","14 November 2014","Interstellar, Another feather in Nolan's cap, This movie is surely one of the Nolan's finest blend, it had everything that makes you glued to the seats and those nail biting moments I can watch it again and have the same feeling as watching it for the first time, and don't be fooled by some idiots claiming that the movie is way too technical and you need to brush up your Physics before watching the movie, don't fall for this bullshit, the movie is clear and concise and well not to mention but just like any other Nolan movie this one also leaves much to your interpretation and I believe that's what makes the movies of Nolan stand out from others, it's all about IMAGINATION with a good bit of science and what could very well be a reality, I don't want to spoil it for you by revealing any interesting parts of the movie, I would recommend the movie to anyone who loves watching fiction movies that makes you believe in the fiction they portray, yes we are far from the reality, but when you are in there watching this movie, those 3 hours you become a part of the movie and it becomes the reality, few movies have given me such experience in the past, and this one definitely tops the chart!","

"vikascoder","7 November 2014","SPOILER FREE BEGINS *********I had a sneaking feeling that Christopher Nolan was a director who wasn't particularly good at staging emotional sequences, nor had a special skill in staging action sequences nor has consistency in his screen writing which may range from mediocre (The Dark Knight Rises and overall logical setup of the Batman series) or sublime (Memento, Inception). What always worked for Nolan was that his movies were always interesting and always intriguing and if the script was any good, he made classics.Interstellar represents a colossal failure of Nolan on every front imaginable. Let's start with the plot which is the most looked forward thing in his movies. The plot involving the World's end and the attempt to save it via Interstellar travel is so hokey that you may think you are watching a Michael Bay movie. If you could complain about ""Gravity""s leaps of logic, then you will realize there is absolutely no physical logic in this script. The story is a Galaxy sized plot hole. The sad part is that it isn't even original which you would come to expect from the Nolan Brothers. It's a bad mishmash of Gravity, Coherence, 2001 a Space Odyssey and Contact book ended by a cringe inducing emotional thread that it will compel you to flay your hands in the air over the inept acting, dialogues, staging, and poor editing, story and what not. If you were expecting an ""Inception"" than don't, Interstellar has the most contrived sci- fi plot in existence coupled with bad acting. It's Armageddon with a sense of higher purpose. At least I enjoyed Armageddon.SPOILER FREE ENDS ********Now back to the plot points. Lets talk about the plot. The world is ending, and I could not fathom why, nor could Nolan show us the World in a broad sense apart from one single corn field farm in the middle of nowhere which conveniently houses an ultra secret project by NASA. If the world is ending, who will save it? Of course the ""Aliens"" or ""They"" (insert oooooooooooh). I thought the movie would involve humans discovering Interstellar travel.I never went into the movie thinking that a huge big ass Worm Hole was conveniently placed by 5- Dimensional unexplained aliens as a convenient plot device to jump into the whole space travel thingy. How hokey is that? And the hokum continues with supremely bad exposition ever committed on screen with fellow astronauts explaining how worm holes work (""Ah it's shaped like a sphere!) or how time dilation works in relativity theory. It seems like none of Johnathan or Christopher could truly grasp how these concepts should work in the context of the film and hence these appear as contrived elements in the service of producing cheap thrills (""oh we lost so many years"").And talking about cheap thrills, can anyone possibly out there condone how stupid the middle reveal was with our famous cameo from a famous actor? Okay let's talk about the ending. One can apparently fly into a black hole, make contact with 5-Dimensional entities who will present you a menu of quantum states of possibilities in order to save the world by how? How? By transmitting some mumbo-jumbo data via Morse Code through a ticking hand of a watch to a woman on the other side of the space time continuum so that she can umm fit it into the equation? or was it a constant? what is a 5 pager formula? How did it work? Hokey as hell.And the visuals? Oh the problem is since Gravity came out and took the crown of the best space visuals in the last 5 years, what could Instellar do? Well lets have some obviously fake looking CGI dust clouds. Have your space ship fly over a Windows wallpaper of Saturn. How was any of it ""Original""? Let's look at the planet. One has Water with a fake wall of waves, one has simply ice. That's it. Water and Ice. Where did you spend your money on Mr Nolan? Oh the Robots were hilarious but you would cringe in your seats thinking how a rectangular block of moving pillar was a good Robot Design and how the poor chap was managing to run on flat ground.And the acting? Cringeworthy Mumblecore.I don't think even the fanboys can save this one.","

"marbl-1","26 September 2017","Although the idea is simple and written 100 times in SF novels and short stories, it could make a quite good space opera. It could be deep and wise. It could make people think. But no. It had to be wasted. The weakest point is not poor acting (by the way: McConaughey really can't speak? I am not the best in the world in English, but I know many native speakers who couldn't understand him talking), awful music. Even the dumbest possible design of a robot is not the worst part of the movie. It is a forced, painful solemness and pretended adherence to science and logic combined with funny, childish errors and a mile wide gaps in logic.It would take to much time and space to write down all stupid ideas, so just a few of them. Some of them are partially explained in the movie or e.g. in IMDb FAQ, but the explanations are even more naive than the goofs themselves. I start with a biggest problem: - In R. E. Raspe's ""Baron Munchausen"", the baron drowns in the mud and saves his life by pulling himself out, on his own hair. The Earthmen in the movie do the same: the humans from the future save their ancestors. But if the present people perish, there are no future people to save them... The most simple paradox, and yet they included it in the ""serious"" movie. And no naive explanations (branches, interpretations, non-linear timelines etc) can make it wiser, no matter how many times they use the word ""fractal"". And if the future people exist, they don't need to do anything, do they? - The best plan from the future humans is to put (in a past) a wormhole, 2 years flight from Earth, making it almost impossible to find and reach. Then the Earthmen would have to build spaceships for billions of people to travel to a new world. I would simply help the Earthmen get a decent crops...A catastrophic climate change destroys all the crops. How? During just several years? And all plants are dead? All animals? But humans survived? How? Isn't it possible e.g. to grow some algae in oceans? Why nobody even tries to do anything? - Why an anti-science education? A science never does any harm. Only the politics and businessmen do, using science. So it is not the science to be ostracized.A farmer drives his children to anti-science school fully equipped to bring a military drone down (has a specially programmed computer, antennas, means to establish a connection, etc.) - A ""ghost"" communication is very implausible. Does it really depend on gravity? Even some waves, oscillations would create observed effects on books/dust, the gravity hardly could.Barely legal NASA base, hidden in a barn, building a spaceship... Funny. Unsuccessfully looking for it's best pilot in the world, year after year... Funny. The pilot accidentally finds them, and is captured and interrogated like a war prisoner by scientists - funny. The scientists are pilot's old friends. And they just finished building a rocket. He has never seen this ship, he is a farmer for 20 years now, so will he fly it, the only hope for humanity, please? FUNNY! - Plan A and B. Science and technology so advanced that can keep human embryos alive during a space journey, and rise them to get humans, can not rise a radish on Earth (nor perform a MRI scan).Please, stop the stupid ""expert's presentation how it works"" (the imbecile with a pencil demonstrating wormholes, just like the similar imbecile in ""The Martian"" explaining the trivial maneuver around Earth). What makes it even more pathetic, the ""expert"" addresses his childish show to a engineer and best NASA pilot....and so on... I don't understand the physics that stands beside the unusual phenomena in the alien solar system, on its planets (the hundred miles high waves on an ocean two feet deep, the frozen, solid clouds in the air, the anti-logic movements of the ships, the anti-logic decisions of the crew... and so on...and at the end I (and all the nearby watchers) couldn't believe the stupidity of the falling to the black hole behind the main character daughter's bookshelves. It was... it was... unspoken. And the Future Men felt that the best way of communication with Present People is to shake the books in some girls' bedroom. If you can move the book, or a hand of the watch - that means, you can move objects - you can take a pen and write as well. It is the same action, using the same forces. Yes, I fully understand the meanings, metaphors, 11 dimensions of continuum, and so on. Doesn't help.To sum up: Interstellar is just another pseudoscience-fiction movie. It is intended to be deep and serious, but is just funny (including it's makers argumentation why it is not). It is not easy to think out a GOOD SF story. You can easily make a non-science fiction story which is very good and nice to read or watch (like Star Wars), but it cannot pretend it is serious and science-based. The most depressing thing about that movie is, however, it's huge overrating on IMDb. Are the young people so easy to control? If they see something that makes the first impression of having some value (slow, grave, pseudo-intellectual) they give 9 and 10 points just to show they are serious and deep-thinking? Is that why poor SF movies get such a high notes? Passengers, the last few Aliens and so on?My ""4"" rating is a real one, not lowered to balance the general overrating.","

"mowasteph","18 November 2014","Here's its 2 stars...I saw it in IMAX so I enjoyed going through the wormhole. Other than that? Well, let's get started...It's so typical - almost clichéd! - the way billions of dollars are spent on the visuals of movies these days and zero dinero on the script. Interstellar is a prime example of this. It just might be the definitive example.I'm not going to go into the science much because I'm a tad science- and space-illiterate but even I could see glaring holes in this tripe. For one thing, what kind of impossible tidal forces create a mile- high tidal wave out of 2 feet of water? Why weren't drones sent into the wormhole instead of people? That corn looked pretty green to me, didn't you think so? What's going on in London or Montreal or Buenos Aires or anywhere other than Kansas? Is Kansas the last place anyone is? Can't the black guy just once make it to the end of the movie? Why is NASA housed inside the Bonaventure Hotel? (okay sorry, I'm from LA and recognized it right away)Did Matt Damon owe someone a role and that's why he's in this tripe giving the worst performance of his career? Why weren't Matthew M's grandchildren and great grandchildren the slightest bit interested in him? Who the hell cast Matthew M in this? How was it possible to relay ""tapes from loved ones at home"" across those distances but nobody could relay anything back? What was up with that stupid robot?Okay, forgetting science and crazy-ass tesseracts for a moment...the human element of the script was incredibly eye-rolling. Remember that notoriously stupid moment in Armageddon when Liv Tyler screams ""That my father up there!""? Well the entire ""human"" aspect of this story and all the dialogue seemed to be written by whomever wrote that classic line. What was so wrong with treating the audience like intelligent people and giving then a straight, highly scientific, awe-at-the-majesty-of-the-universe, harsh reality sci-fi film that didn't insult you at every turn instead of this z-grade soap opera with neat-o visuals?","

"dhruvbehl24","10 November 2014","One of the best sci-fi movies.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater. Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see. And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade. Just go for it, without a second thought.","

There is a gravity to their work and they each show it well.My favorite genre us sci fi. This is plausible scifi, which is my favorite subset of scifi. McConnahey is amazing as usual. The young actress who plays his daughter seems like a break out star who we will def see again.The music is so good I'm learning a guitar transcription of some of the songs on the finger style guitar we site.I've seen Interstellar 7 or 8 times.

It seemed to me that used actual rocket launch footage? The time element is misused and the special effects are not that great. I thought Elysium knocked socks off this film.

"inframan","12 December 2015","I resent its cynically shallow pessimism disguised as apple pie sentimentalism, its artistic laziness & its technical sloppiness. I resent its condescending attitude towards its audience. By virtue of its sheer popularity on IMDb it's a testament to the colossal, continuing dumbing down of movie audiences.Where to start on specifics? The premise of a world-wide drought (a major blooper mentioned on this site) with tall green stalks of healthy looking corn. Okra grown as a major food crop (or was that supposed to be a joke)? Cut & paste interviews from a Ken Burns documentary abut the real dust bowl. The tiresome cheapie ""homages"" to Kubrick's 2001. The pedantic Astrophysics for Dummies lectures.The soap opera characters. The one dimensional acting. The utter predictability of every single plot twist. I'd get more specific, but then I'd be blacklisted for including spoilers. You want to see imaginative mind-blowing science-fiction/fantasy film making? Let me make 2 suggestions: Stalker and Solaris. Both Russian films directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. Far lower budgets than Hollywood blockbusters but works of pure genius. Avoid the American version of Solaris. It's a travesty, though not quite as awful as Interstellar. In summary the sheer numbing dullness & stupidity of Interstellar (& its concomitant popularity) managed to knock me into the worst state of depression I've experienced from a movie in years.","

"preppy-3","13 November 2014","A simple farm guy named Copper (Matthew McConaughey) and a few other experts go into outer space to explore other worlds that might sustain human life. It seems that that life on Earth might not survive due to to some unexplained environmental disaster. Naturally nothing goes right.WAY overpraised and terrible sci-fi movie. When I heard the plot from this I expected the worst. Writer/director Christopher Nolan has never been a favorite for me--I HATE what he did to Batman in his movie trilogy. I thought that he as trying to imitate Stanley Kubrick (""2001"") here but it's far worse--he's doing Steven Spielberg! The movie runs WAY too long (165 minutes) and they're constantly pushing family friendly values in your face. Cooper's non-stop yammering about his daughter got on my nerves instantly. Also that stupid fake southern accent he adopts is immediately annoying. The story is very slow and all the characters are cardboard cutouts you've seen in other movies. The special effects are flawless and there's some beautiful cinematography here but the extreme length and boring story really weigh it down. Any sort of statement they're trying to make on time and life is completely deadened by the script. Also this movie is very manipulative and way too sentimental. They go out of their way to make the audience cry--like at a Spielberg movie. Well I did cry--tears of joy at the end that this was over! Also the gaps in logic and plot holes here are very annoying. I lost track of how many times I rolled my eyes at the dubious ""logic"" served up here. The acting was as good as it could be (I guess) but, at the end, they throw in a surprise guest star (who I won't name). It didn't help because I think he's a terrible actor and this didn't change my mind. I was bored and looked at my watch MANY times while this played. It's boring, obvious and manipulative. Why is this getting so much praise? Skip it.","

"moviexclusive","4 November 2014","How do we begin to describe 'Interstellar', Christopher Nolan's most ambitious film to date? There will probably be no doubt, once you've seen it, that it reaches for the stars; whether it manages to get there is quite something else altogether. Whereas 'Inception' showed the filmmaker's refusal to be restrained by physical dimension, his latest sees him attempt to take an even bigger leap across space and time, envisioning our three-dimensional reality as part of a larger five-dimensional whole, and employing some of the very best technical wizards to create such wondrously dazzling visuals that you cannot help but be mesmerised.By imagery alone, it is flawless. A dying dust-choked planet Earth in the near future is depicted in a somewhat familiar yet eerily unsettling landscape of agrarian society. A single spacecraft is seen as a gleaming spark against Saturn's giant gaseous rings. Bright flashes alternate with pitch darkness as the same spacecraft enters a wormhole to emerge in a different galaxy. Each planet we explore in this brand new world is a sight to marvel in itself - one an endless expanse of water where waves rise higher than the eye can see; another is pure ice, where even the clouds are snow chunks. And amidst such surreal beauty, the one scene that will probably stay in your head for a while is that of different moments in time as a binary puzzle, meant to illustrate a key relationship in the film about gravity and time.Since his breakthrough hit 'Memento', Christopher has displayed a fascination with twisting time, and 'Interstellar' is no different. It may unfold in a largely linear fashion, but it plays with time more than you realise. On one hand, time is relative, such that one hour on a foreign planet counts for seven Earth years passed - so much so that while Matthew McConaughey's NASA test pilot named Cooper looks the same throughout the film, Timothee Chalamet and Mackenzie Foy as his 15- year son Tom and 10-year old daughter Murphy are replaced midway by Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain respectively. That is the easier part - and then there is the scientific mumbo-jumbo that sees time in the context of black holes, gravitational singularities and the possibility of extra-dimensional space.Another hallmark of Christopher's films has been their cerebral aspirations, but 'Interstellar' surpasses all his previous works by (over)reaching into an unnecessarily convoluted labyrinth of hokey quantum physics. To be sure, it is very serious about being serious, throwing about plenty of technical dialogue and making no apologies for assuming that its audience for smart intelligent beings. A lot of that will undoubtedly whiz by on the first viewing, but by trying to engage on such an intellectual level, it ultimately becomes the cause of its undoing with a logic-defying second half that cross- cuts furiously between Cooper in a race-against-time up in space and Murphy in a similar position back on Earth. Even without thinking too much into it, one already gets the nagging sense that it violates its very own relativity principle of one hour versus seven years.Yet ironically, that is also the most entertaining segment of the film, which otherwise spends too much time (in Earth years, we may add) on melodramatic partings and monotonous stretches in space. With his brother, Johnathan, Christopher wraps the heady interstellar voyage around the bond between parent and child, or more specifically, that between Cooper and Murphy, who takes the parting especially badly; but these supposedly heart-rending scenes at the start are overwrought, and no thanks to Hans Zimmer's incessantly intrusive score, terribly manipulative. In contrast, a simple scene where the camera is simply trained on Cooper as he cries his eyes out watching years and years of backlogged video messages left by his son back on Earth is much more poignant - and without a soundtrack that instructs you how to feel.Much as Christopher tries to ground the movie in the humanity between Cooper and Murphy, 'Interstellar' is better appreciated as an exposition on big ideas - and there are many bandied about here. Mankind's place in space is encapsulated in McConaughey's lament that ""we used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars; now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt"". Much later on, Matt Damon pops up to make an emphatic point about survival as the primal instinct, and by that, we mean survivial of the individual, not the human race. That is nicely contrasted against the motivation behind Cooper's mission itself, which his mentor Professor Brand (Michael Caine) reveals on his deathbed to be much more selfless - or selfish, depending on your perspective - than what he had initially told Cooper.Similarly, 'Interstellar' is a film of many contradictions. It wants so desperately to be intellectual, so it grounds its science in the theories of renowned CalTech physicist Kip Thorne, but it violates these principles in favour of building a more thrilling (and complex) narrative. It wants to be moving, but it under-develops the relationships between its characters and then tries to wring emotion out of every intimate scene. And at the heart of it is an unblinking motivation to be important, to be significant, to be monumental, to matter like Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece did, and to be both science and fiction at the same time. Indeed, there is no doubt it reaches for the stars, but 'Interstellar' remains right where we are - gazing up at these constellations, and never quite getting any closer to them.","

"stahlrattede","2 October 2023","The father-daughter relationship of Interstellar is often overseen, yet Nolan did an extraordinary job in this domain with Matthew McConaughey perfectly executing it. As a father who has a daughter, I'm deeply impressed how Nolan touched on this subject every time I rewatch it. It's so deep, it almost gives an ideal blueprint of how to connect with your kids on an emotional and intellectual level, and how to be the right parent for them. Any father, especially with a daughter, would understand what I mean! :) It's pure gold.I have a very close relationship with my little daughter, we are best friends, in some way similar to that of Interstellar, and I've always tried to prioritize it, but I find myself always learning something new from Cooper and Murph.As a huge sci-fi fan, I'll even completely ignore the sci-fi part in this review! :))","

"indiedavid","7 November 2014","""Interstellar"" was an above average film and I have no regrets spending a Friday night checking it out. Unsophisticated audiences may enjoy it if they don't analyze it too deeply. However, if you are one who understands the world of physics, aviation, or space travel, this one is hard to watch. There are a plethora of continuity issues as well as plot holes. It seems like Chris Nolan watched ""Gravity"" and decided he could make a really terrible film into something worth watching. He added the ""Contact"" premise and inserted some Physics theories and some expanded back story to create a mediocre film. I was hopeful that I would be impressed by the obviously inflated reviews but I wasn't. The guy next to me actually fell asleep during the first hour which was very grueling. Of our group, there were three thumbs down and one thumbs up.","

"arnieiam","14 November 2014","Look this is still a good film and my rating system has no actual weight here. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant film maker but lately you start noticing that he is not without his shortcomings.His films are laden with the same tropes especially the massive plot holes. And that was the reason I wanted to see this film, to see what plot hole he had this time and yes they are a plenty.I will still give credit to where it's due. He really wanted to make a head scratcher and this time with the laws of general relativity which the film does closely follow. Basically the emotional device here is that Matthew Mahogany traveling at a fraction of the speed of light through space makes him age slower than his kids and basically its a race against time.However the Nolan-isms come full circle with not-so-subtle foreshadowing, overly pretentious unnatural dialogue, heavy-handed symbolism, a really ear-ringing Hans Zimmer score which make the Inception horns sound like and an unnecessarily long run time.I can see that this is a script he didn't really have time to think through but you can see he tried and its still pretty entertaining. However it's no 2001 A Space Odyssey. He should stick to thrillers. Sorry.","

"majoreasy","11 November 2014","Firstly, I quite like the movie in terms of visuals and the sound track. About 10 minutes in though, I find myself wishing for sub-titles as the actors' voices are inaudible. (I like MM but where is Clooney when we need him?) Now, the story idea is not half bad except Nolan misunderstood the meaning of Sci-Fi...the fiction part of 'Science Fiction' refers to the science portion of a narrative, not the human story. Leaps of faith can be justified with stretching science, especially in areas not fully understood/known by people. The human part of the story has to be true for the audience to relate to (unless there is a setting in the story for human evolution that makes them different to what we are now.) Too many illogical human behaviours are just strung together to move this along and I believe Nolan hoped that the great visuals will distract us from thinking about what is going on. I will highlight a few that ruined the movie for me, even though plenty more were present. Watch out...spoilers below!1)Murph had experienced the 'ghost' from a young age yet didn't know who it might be; yet, when we find out that the 'ghost' is Cooper, she suddenly comes to the same realisation?!? That is of course essential to the story or otherwise she will not take what he transmits seriously, yet there is no reason for her to link the 'ghost' to her father. He could have easily added a message of 'This is your dad' to her, but he never did; and even if he had, it wouldn't work with the younger Murph...if he had located the older Murph (when she was retrieving her stuff), then maybe it will make more sense...very lazy story telling here as it could have been easy to add (maybe 20 seconds of screen time?). This one thing is key to the later part of the movie and without it; the movie couldn't go along the lines it did.2)Assuming we accept that Tor and Cooper did work out the mystery of the black hole that relates to their calculation and he transmitted all the data through her watch. Even if she did figure out that it's a message from her dad (or from someone important), she wasn't paying attention to the message. It is like tuning in to a radio talk show (on serious maths no less) mid-way through a program, there is no way for her to decipher the full message if she missed the first large chunk of what was sent.3)He knew that the message 'Stay' wouldn't work to keep him on the ground. Shouldn't he try a different message? Of course, that would change history and likely Nolan didn't want to go near this paradox...but this is Sci-Fi and I'd welcome the debate that would bring...instead, he rehashes the same old, knowing it wouldn't work.4)Young Murph was understandably upset with her dad when he left...but she becomes part of mission control? Hang on...she has firsthand knowledge of what her father is up to... she knows about plan A, Plan B and the importance of the mission...yet, she wouldn't send him a message? If she became someone outside the scientific field, I can at least accept her continued anger, but putting her in mission control makes it unacceptable. (She should at least be so upset that she wants no part of a mission control which sent her dad away. Otherwise, she should understand why he had to go. ) 5) Murph has a space station named after her so she has some cloud on 'her' space station. When she suggested that Coop goes to Brand, she could help with getting him a spacecraft. Instead, he had to steal one...really? Security is not a concern in the future? A guy who has been out of the loop for almost a century just walks into and starts up a craft, knows all the correct codes to open air locks and even the way out?? (Maybe unlike now, aerospace technology does not improve in a century?) The above really killed the movie for me.Sidenotes:A) If according to their plan, skimming just outside the gravity field to go into the water planet quickly, they surely didn't spend 3+ hours there. How did it translate to 23 years? (Well, I spent almost 3 hours watching this nonsense, so maybe it is possible. Not in the way it was shown though.) B) If all of Cooper's electronics failed on entering the black hole, how did TOR survive? TOR is fully electronics! Poor story telling as this could be explained under sci-fi rules yet wasn't done.C) Why would Murph travel 2 years to the space station, with all her family in tow, to visit her father...yet on seeing him, sends him away?D) Dr Mann and Cooper walked to the edge of the cliff...yet Brand takes a few minutes on a spacecraft to reach there? She took so long that Dr Mann had the time to WALK back to the station to board the other spacecraft, before they FLY back. Ridiculous! (Nolan, this is not a commercial flight... flying cannot be so much slower than walking by any stretch of the imagination.) Overall, without a logical human story, Interstellar is just a decent visual and sound show...its almost 3 hours play time is too long when audience is not absorbed into the tale.I gave it a 5 because I did enjoy some part of the movie (the effects and sound), otherwise, it would get a 3.5 out of 10. Almost 3 hours in a cinema is way too much for this lazily told story. (Plus, there's a chance you'll age 23 years.) I sure wouldn't watch it again.","

"DarkVulcan29","13 November 2014","It manages to be a science fiction tale, and at the same time stay grounded in realism, Is what Transcendence tried to do, but didn't quite get there. The performances where very Oscar worthy, and none the characters never for once seemed annoyingly one noted, when anybody was happy or sad in the film you where feeling it with them.Cooper(Matthew McConaughey) a widowed farmer, and former air force pilot, raising two kids, is chosen by NASA to help another place to live for human race, cause the earth is slowly dying. With the heartbreak of having to leave his family. Will Cooper and his launch team succeed before it's too late? I'm sure the filmmakers did there homework on space travel, cause I don't think there just trying to make another sci-fi adventure, they wanted this to feel grounded in reality has possible. Christopher Nolan never ceases to amaze me as a director, with all his films so far, I'm hoping he never slips up. There are some nods to 2001 a Space Odyssey, but this really stands on its own. This effects are beyond incredible. And great performances by Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and Jessica Chastain.","

"madhav-notty","13 November 2014","""Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day."" that was one hell of a dialog from the movie #INTERSTELLAR even though it was inspired from a poem. Chris Nolan made a film which make's even science freaks also don't know some of 'em which he implied in the film. It is evidently clear that he doesn't like this 3-D world which instead he created 5-D world and made 'Time' as a physical quantity in his world. Literally there is no words to explain the ingenuity of Chris. The way he crafted the characters and effectively using technical expertise and screen writing definitely make us to taste 'Transcendence'. once again he proved that he is not a contemporary director but a director who evolved from unrealistic future.Matt did a splendid job by portraying 'cooper' and express his emotions as a destitute and grief-stricken father was incomparable. Hans zimmer, he is at his best. Anne and Jess made justice to their roles. Matt Damon and Michael Caine played a pivotal role as well. Chris also made 'India' as part of his film because of 'M.O.M' i think, even though it is little about India i think. overall film is astoundingly superb with intense screenplay unless you detest physics or you lack keenness but its better to study a Lil'bit before 'bon appetite'. Remember ""do not go gentle into that good movie"".#INTERSTELLAR and #INCEPTION are the best sci-fi masterpieces i've ever seen in this decade. Take a bow Chris Nolan and ""orgoglioso DI es sere UN fan DI Christopher Nolan''","

"max_tout","18 November 2014","This is without exception one of the dumbest films I have ever sat through. Or perhaps it's a masterpiece and I'm too dumb to understand it? Anyway .....Here are some of the things (the list is not exhaustive) that I could not get my head around.There is a catastrophic failure in most of the crops of the world. And the entire scientific community simply shrugs and says, 'Oh well. Dem's the breaks' and does nothing. Seriously? Apart from that one dude in the 'super secret' NASA compound? Okay then.A super intelligent, super advanced alien civilization has been watching us. They see that the planet is in peril. That more than six thousand million people will die from starvation. So they offer a solution. Not by curing the blight mind. No, that would be far too easy.They construct a wormhole (they being five dimensional creatures 'n' all) close to Saturn ('cos Kubrick had already used Jupiter in 2001). The film makes a big deal about corn being the only viable crop still resisting the blight (cornmash beer anybody) but it's only a matter of time before that too succumbs. So It's a matter of great urgency that the astro-heroes get to the ol' wormhole as quickly as possible. So the far side of the Moon would be a handy place to put it. No, no, noooo.They place the wormhole beside Saturn. So distant from Earth that it takes two years just to fly there. And all the while any poor kids unfortunate enough to be called Dusty are getting the crap beaten out of them at Pharming College. Anybody for cornflakes? Now NASA have already explored the wormhole. They know that it opens into another galaxy, beside a black hole and an assortment of potential new worlds. Because of the proximity of the planets to the black hole, time will be distorted and a couple of hours exploring these new worlds will translate to decades back on Earth. While back on ol' Planet earth the corn crops fail and the dust storms gather pace. So this was the plan?By the super intelligent aliens? Is someone taking the p*ss? There were no planets anywhere that were ... um ... NOT right beside a black hole? Super intelligent? Doh! And so finally, after a number of silly subplots, our hero finally descends onto the event horizon of the black hole (My God! It's full of stars?). And experiences time as a physical construct. But is he shown the origin of the blight that is wiping out the planet so that he might alert the scientific community? Hell no. He is shown his daughter's bedroom on the day that he left on his 'weekend getaway.' We see him getting really upset that his daughter isn't picking up on his STAY ...... STAY! gravity assisted message, even though he should remember that she shouted STAY .... STAY! to him on that day, and he left anyway. Sheesh! And Zimmer's soundtrack? I hadn't heard about the soundtrack request came to him via email, without him ever seeing the movie. Explains a lot really. Presumably the email went something like 'If you produce anything orchestral like Kubrick, you're off the project.' So the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of ponderous bass heavy synth driven (in the cinema where I watched it) piercingly loud quasi classical discordance. Bear in mind that Kubrick chose the pieces by Strauss, etc., to assist him in editing the movie,and then realised that they actually fit perfectly, and so discarded the original soundtrack that he had commissioned.Not Nolan.NoSirreeBob! Email it in, Hans.Who listens to the music anyway? Deeply, deeply disappointing.And I loved Inception!","

The emotional layer is as great as it gets. You may very well find yourself crying possibly more than once. Finally the imagination was mind blowing rolling around the edges of the things you are yet willing to accept as possible.

"SvetoslavGrigorov","16 November 2014","Interstellar by Christopher NollanReviewed by Svetoslav GrigorovFirst, I had to look at the score on www.IMDb.com to confirm that all the rumors were true (9 out of 10): me and Paul were the only ones who didn't like this movie and left 45 minutes before it had finished. Whatever that means I can assure you that I was/am still sober and I am not a zombie like the rest of the crowd in the Kettering Odeon cinema. Secondly, I would like to ask how all these critics made the comparison(s) with Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and thirdly, please you who now read this review tell me that I am not the only one in my dullest disappointment for the year. Tell me that I haven't lost my marbles, tell me that you were enthralled from this copy of a House On The Prairie and if you think that this is the best movie of your life (or at least 2014), the only answer I can think of is: that's why so many rubbish movies have been released lately. Because the level of the quality has fallen drastically and the conveyor belt of the movie industry is catastrophic for the senses. OK, so straight to the point. First 45 minutes we are introduced to the farming, dust and the coming famine problems, nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere, Earth is doomed, father and daughter found a super-secret location that NASA strategically placed for their eyes only. We see a lot of corn and even the nineties Children of The Corn was a better shallow slasher while this one turns out to be an American clichéd space marmalade, and my best fitting comparison for it is Armageddon which is not really a movie, but a joke. Wormholes, saving of the human kind, bringing resources, planting/replanting, Plan A /Plan B, frozen embryos to colonize a distant world, overcoming gravity, scientists and even a quantum physics and so much camera- philosophy that Kubrick will turn in his grave, daddy-please-don't-go-to-space-cause –I'm- gonna-cry, bam the watch on the floor (I don't wanna see you anymore), counting while going into the stratosphere, Lego-robot which somehow was better acting than the rest of the actors or at least was more fun. Wait, wait, did I say actors? Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine (The rest of them are not worth mentioning apart from the crying daughter Murph who did her best job).Matthew McConaughey has one of the most annoying twangs ever and his jaundiced bad- version-face of Paul Newman cannot contribute to any script lately (let's not forget that without the help of Jared Leto and his masterful transformation in The Dallas Buyers Club his Oscar was going to hell). His mumbling could be understood only from the villagers in Kentucky and what he is on aboutSeriously, I needed subtitles to comprehend his actor's efforts in such a ""serious"" movie. How serious this movie was! I pushed myself to read couple of the 'serious' critical reviews and they had the audacity to call it ""scientific""??? Oh man, poor Anne Hathaway who looked sometimes at the camera and was likely apologizing for the mess she was in. I felt sorry for her.The script was the hell of the hells. Such nonsense with no credibility and no creativity at all. Total zero or even below the zero. As I said we left long before the end because my time is precious. I will open Isaac Asimov's (or Stanislaw Lem's) short stories and will be engulfed in characters and situations, so my brain will be given food for thought while all these poor people are going to see Interbol..cks and will be exposed on the radiation of a mediocrity (yes, I felt cheated like someone was trying to insult me). Well, if you who now read this review respect yourself and really like Kubrick, Moon, Gravity (and even Contact) and other good sci-fi don't waste your time and save your money. Today we wasted £40 including the drinks, the popcorn and the tickets and the only thing that I was inspired for was my generated anger for this text. My verdict on the scale from 1 to 10 is to give ONE for the director Christopher Nolan who needs a little encouragement and I am hoping he will not slip into the shoes of M. Night Shyamalan who have crafted a lot of rubbish lately as you know. God forbid that never happens.P.S.Don't tell me that I have sat there for 2 (it's actually 169 minutes) hours of a film and it had a great ending cause I don't want know.","

"tabuno","15 January 2019","8 November 2014. Interstellar (2014). What stands out in this movie is the role of emotion and how the script introduces a fascinating ""long-distance"" relational component of parent-child interaction unlike those movies with a similar powerful, intense, and emotive impact found in the horror movies of Jennifer Connelly's performance in Dark Water (2005), Radha Mitchell's performance in Silent Hill (2006) or John Cusack's performance in 1408 (2007). Interstellar is today's version of the 1950s sci fi classic Forbidden Planet (1956) in storytelling, big scale, and special effects, perhaps rivaling 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) of the sixties, or the sci fi monster thriller hit of the1970s Alien (1979) in its scale and authenticity or the inspirational, newly presented idea film of the last decade of the super hit Avatar (2009). The interweaving of two story lines in this movie was also a huge editing and script challenge that was well handled and presented on screen. Interstellar is solid story telling with its dramatic but not overly stylish Hollywood gloss and glamour as of say Avatar or Forbidden Planet. Even Ann Hathaway's under-stated surprisingly diminutive performance stands out as a directorial and acting highlight considering Hathaway's bigger than life screen presence and public popularity of the past that enhancing the impact of the movie.The overall direction and performances in this movie are introspective and authentic in their approach much like that found in the sci fi drama Stranded (2001) or Apollo 18 (2011) that don't rely on big screen stereotypical theatrics to wow its audiences. Somehow this supposedly epic sci fi adventure is as intimate as Cloud Atlas (2012) was as large spanning literally hundreds of years. Unlike a number of other review references comparing Interstellar to the visual style of sci fi action thriller Inception (2010) or some brief resemblance to Gravity (2013), Interstellar seems to take more from the sci fi relational drama Upside Down (2013) and the sci fi space drama Elysium (2013). As for plot outline, one can argue that Interstellar has more in common with the sci fi mystery of Oblivion (2013) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968 ) especially with noted theoretical leading astrophysicist Kip Thorne as scientific consultant and executive producer. And in contrast, the minimalist music score is in departure to A Space Odyssey's dominating and sometimes haunting musical score. This mind twisting experience includes pieces of the emotion and twisting, off balance characteristics of Déjà vu (2006).Some might complain about the extended dialogue, there really is a more satisfying exchange of relevant thoughtful ideas during this movie that are interspersed among amazing special effects that are leading edge for our literal time and space. When it comes to cerebral and emotive impact, Interstellar does so in a more narrative, mystery drama fashion as Ender's Game (2013) hit the similar points using a war action, adventure motif. The sci fi television mini-series The Triangle (2005) brought many of the intriguing and suspense aspects in a lower budgeted, popular mass audience approach, but also indicating how Interstellar was presented in a quality, big budget, high definition big screen format with a corresponding mesmerizing impact. What makes Interstellar so markedly ground breaking is director's Christopher Nolan's leap with this movie in its freshness and significantly different visual presentation, its tight editing and retention of the human relational importance while also presenting to dual track story outline in seamless and meaningful power way. Interstellar recalls the similar breathing mind-bending experiences in Brainstorm (1983) with Natalie Wood and Christopher Walken. Contact (1997) with Jodie Foster and also co-starring Matthew McConaughey, the children's version of A Wrinkle In Time (2002), the otherworldly time altering classic of Slaughter-House Five (1972), the haunting alien ambiance of Solaris (2002).","

"sylvain-14","9 November 2014","A good friend of mine, the writer Mark Shulman, once pointed out that our standards are being gradually eroded, so that sadly, we are left with less and less in lieu of a threshold of acceptability, finding ourselves not unlike frogs in a pan being brought to a slow, imperceptible boil.Christopher Nolan and some of his cast are telling the press that Interstellar is a love story. I will take them at their word and assume that whatever else I picked up on was left there unwittingly, for the rest of us to parse through. Considering how much pain is involved in traveling to and from a crowded movie theater on a Saturday night, I feel like it's my prerogative, when I have paid good money, to take a film apart if I am still hungry for substance at the end of it; and I WILL get my nourishment from something or other, if not from the movie's plot itself.The first thing that strikes me, when I think back to the experience of Interstellar, is that it leaves me with nothing, emotionally - no takeaway. I did not care about any of its characters, or believe they were real, and I did not really worry about the fate of humanity (any more than the film itself actually does, beyond paying it casual lip-service). I wasn't awed like I may have been by other wondrous space movies that Interstellar measures itself against (or steals from), and I am not compelled to go back and see any part of it ever again. (I suspect most viewers won't either, once the collective neophile contact high has passed.)For starters, I do not like the moral core of the story: Interstellar is a film about ""saving humanity"" but it is unclear who will pay for humanity's failures. The film offers a great debate over where to repopulate, but none about what we have learned from having to leave our home in the first place. There is no therapy, no penance, no sacrifice. In a way, this represents a subconscious confession about our culture's moral failures: when we run out of spaces to consume, and out of fertile ground to slash an burn, we will have to look for new worlds to expand out into, since we cannot show self control and learn to care for what we have...But enough psychobabble. A dysfunctional moral compass is not the worst thing about Interstellar.The worst thing about the film is that, to quote my girlfriend, ""It's OK to for characters to talk in pseudo-scientific gobbledygook when the show is Star Trek, because in Star Trek, they all have pointy ears.""Interstellar may be worth a glance, certainly for the photography and exciting visuals, but it is a buffet of messy ideas that fire in all directions. Clearly the script is not written by career screenwriters, but by a director who has freed himself from gravity and has achieved his own artificial self-sufficiency amid the vast nothingness. The result is an often far-fetched and unintelligible, outlandish tale which takes an awfully long time to suspend the viewer's disbelief (and cringing), to finally arrive at a tepid plot after about an hour or so.In hindsight, it makes perfect sense that Nolan's 'tightest' film is Memento, a dis-cognitive story told from the point of view of a man who is unable to string two events together, or to remember where he started.Interstellar is not an intelligent picture, but a pseudo-intelligent one. It seems designed to appeal to the sort of audience who loves to be flattered with cheap shots - a sort of space odyssey version of ""who wants to be a millionaire?"" Its success resting entirely on the fact that every member of the audience gets to feel superior. To whom? No one knows. This technique seems to be trending within the Nolan's filmography.For the rest, the picture is a narrative mess that trivializes space travel on a galactic scale, (black hole, wormhole, same difference,) and is often plagued by ridiculous star-studded cameos that shatter the viewer's concentration by landing in the middle of tense emotional scenes like a cockroach in your soup. The film is oddly timed with elliptical cuts that compress the action into some often confusing edits, and only leave in lieu of dialog some awful scenes of trite, contrived exposition, filled with emetic pseudo physics, sure to give an immature modern audience raised on Batman a sense that they are building their cultural ego by agreeing with this farce. Worst of all, it feels long and never ending.Sadly, good science fiction is hard to come by, harder than a good ordinary film even, and although this picture is somewhat entertaining, it fades away from the heart and mind, like the flickering green of the traffic light we just passed, as we head home from the cinema, once more.","

The ones that inspire you to want to change your life after a mere two and a half hours.I watched this movie the first time over a month and a half ago and it still crops up in my mind. The thought of space travel excites me along with countless others and this movie has literally made me rethink my life choices and pushed me into wanting to become an astronaut. As childish as it sounds, its true, because its one of those movies. Interstellar has become my new favourite movie by far.Bravo Nolan what a great human bean","

I couldn't believe when it ended that it was already finished; time appeared to go away quickly when watching this in the theater and remember when it ended, I wished there was more of this epic movie.Great directing, great performances, the effects/sets could have been better (I like my detail which unfortunately some scenes/effects lacked) and you got to take a big leap of faith to ignore the obvious paradox. If you do the latter, you will enjoy a Nolan's masterpiece.One of my top ten movies of all time and most likely the best sci-fi I have ever watched.","

"namashi_1","8 November 2014","Christopher Nolan's much awaited 'Interstellar' is Stellar, Indeed! Nolan takes us to space & beyond, delivering a film that's both, astounding & futuristic. Made unfathomable ambition & force, this Sci-Fi/Family-Drama, deserves a watch for the experience it gives you as a viewer & also a human being.'Interstellar' Synopsis: A group of explorers make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the limitations on human space travel and conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage.'Interstellar' raises questions on the future & on what maybe the fate of mankind after all. Jonathan & Chris Nolan's Screenplay fills in all the scientific punches to lead it in, that eventually, is more a tale of a father & his daughter. 'Interstellar' proudly captures the strong bond of family-bond, that we all experience & relate too in our lives. The portions back home on earth are wonderfully executed. The Sci-Fit bit, however, is stunning & equally captivating. The twist & turns in the narrative, featuring a surprise cameo Matt Damon, only keep you guessing on what's gonna happen next. Its purely edge-of-the-seat rush.Chris Nolan's Direction is gargantuan, just like the film's scale. Nolan handles this important story with care & style. Each & Every Visual has been filmed amazingly by Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema. You can't look away from the Screen for a single moment! Lee Smith's Editing is pretty crisp, despite the film's mammoth length, which goes on for more than 168-minutes. Hans Zimmer's Score is exhilarating. Visual Effects are Oscar-Worthy. Performance-Wise: Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, delivers a heartfelt performance. The Oscar-Winning Actor is the soul of this epically structured film. Anne Hathaway as Amelia, is perfect in her portrayal. Jessica Chastain as Murphy, Cooper's long suffering daughter, is splendid. Her emotional breakdowns tear you apart. Wes Bentley as Doyle, is effective. Casey Affleck as Tom, is nicely restrained. John Lithgow as Donald, is subtly funny. Michael Caine as Professor Brand, is dignified, as ever. On the whole, 'Interstellar' is not merely a film, its an Experience. Heavily Recommended!","

"j889","2 June 2019","I believe this movie should be rated 5-6 stars.
Cooper had the ability to communicate with the past, he just can't tell NASA or his daughter the destination???
If Cooper gave the right information, they could avoid all the death and sacrifice.Mankind from the future could control gravity, and space time, and they failed to gave solution to blight????When Cooper returned to the space station, he could share all his adventure stories, so future generations learnt his adventure, and in time, when they have the scientific ability, they could pass this information to Cooper in the first place or even people from even earlier. It's a paradox.Nolan tried to be scientifically correct. Cooper gave his daughter a mechanical Hamilton watch. I believe everyone knows how a mechanical watch, it is driven by springs and gears. A mechanical watch's movement direction won't be changed permanently by gravity. Gravity would slow down the watch, but when gravitational influence were gone, the movement should go back to normal, so there is no way, Cooper could use gravitational force to ""encode"" a message into the mechanical watch because the hand of the watch wouldn't stay ""jumpy"": moving back and foreth. He would have better luck using gravity to leave message on the floor. The whole ""watch"" narrative was a big mistake.Cooper loved his daughter, okay, but what about the other kid? He acted as if he only had one kid. That's just weird.It is a good movie, black hole, wormhole stuff are easy to understand, but when you really put your brain to it, you see plot holes. Entertaining but this movie is actually quite stupid.","

How could any professional actor read the script for this movie and not be able to tell that it will be a terrible movie?I really would like to say something positive about the film since it has many of my favorite actors in it.

"brucecsnow","3 April 2023","A decent movie with a lot of production values and star power but at the end is just too surrealistic. You'll hear all the usual imdb rants: magnificent, a triumph, a masterpiece but its all overblown. Slowing a movie down making it mysterious and putting the stakes so high only gets you so far.The movies starts well and who can't get enough of Anne Hathaway's gorgeous face but like the heralded soundtrack after a while it is overhelming.Not every Christopher Nolan movie is a masterpiece from frame to frame. Not every action or lack of action has earth shattering consequence. Sometime its just a highly produced and directed movie that should of had a fresh pair of eyes look at the script before it went into production.","

"redcrystal","5 November 2014","This movie felt like it tried to accomplish two simultaneous and somewhat incompatible endeavors.First, it was thought-provoking. Many questions were raised. What would life on earth be like if our climate runs amok? What happens to government when we all have to live hand-to-mouth? Are ""they"" out there communicating with us? Is it the essence of humanity to survive, or is it to pioneer, and, by extension, evolve? Second, it was also an adventure. I watched this in a full IMAX theater, with eighty bajillion watts of Super Thunder-Round Sound, or whatever the kids call it now. The visual effects definitely shine on the IMAX screen. The format switches occasionally, and usually imperceptibly, between 70mm for the scenes with dialogue, to IMAX format for that full-on dose of retina-overload spectacle. This movie is a wonderfully fun ride through a strangely familiar extra-galactic world. There are also plenty of tense moments, after which you realize you've been holding your breath.I'm glad I went to watch this. That said, I think the film suffers a little from trying to be both an adventure thrill about the dangers of space travel, let alone an actual confrontation with a nemesis, and also a multi-layered allegory involving the dimensional tangle of time, gravity, love, and what it means to survive.It asks more questions than it explores. While it fills in for the missing answers with white-knuckled brushes with death, it wasn't as intellectually satisfying as I hoped. I spent an hour discussing the thoughtful components with a friend. In the end, we were grasping to find symbolism, metaphors, or other messages about humanity. We never coalesced ""the message"" of the movie.But did we need to? It was, as I said, also a thrill ride. The adventurous climax was a little less than terrifyingly dramatic; I can't say I had the same post-climactic cathartic experience as I've had for other movies. But it was a definite end, closing most of the open plot points. I certainly felt moved by the characters' resolutions.I was suspicious that Matthew McConaughey could convince me that he was a space-ready engineer; it turns out that he didn't need to, because he did convince me that he was a dad that loved his children as much as any dad could. I think all the leads delivered solidly: Caine, Lithgow, Hathaway, Damon, Chastain, Affleck... I connected with the characters and felt their pain and happiness.Hans Zimmer played up the drama in the music a little heavily, I thought, and unnecessarily. It wound up creating the opposite of the effect I think he intended. Many of the scenes could have used a lighter touch, musically. Some of them worked brilliantly.Although I had my quibbles, the final analysis is that I would definitely choose to watch the movie a second time, but I'm not making plans to, for now.","

"dplowsav","9 November 2014","Interstellar is not a bad film. Lets get that out of the way... Nor is it a great film either.It straddles the fence of imperfection ever so well. There are some great moments and then there are some very long drawn out moments that make you shout at the screen and say, ""Shut up already and get on with it!"" Once such scene came when Anne Hathaway was talking about love... a lot. Yes, there was a lot of talk about love and analyzing what love means. That moment sucked me out of the film, because I found it hard to be dragged into the immersive experience that Interstellar should be, when it is coupled up with such bad writing that doesn't blend in a scene well.Such out of context reality smashing moments happen a lot in Interstellar that makes you wonder if the writers were tripping out on their own interstellar experience. Another scene comes at the revealing of a betrayal, of sorts, from a certain character. Without going into too much, all I'll say is that the scene felt hammy, rushed and again, didn't blend in what was going on. While I 'get it', as in the reasons for the betrayal, I didn't 'get it' in terms of why it had to happen, and it just felt... strange.By the time the film matures in the middle, it goes downhill and your left on a spiraling out of control adventure that is the result of some new age writing gone bad.If that wasn't bad enough, I had to put up with the endless scenes of key dialogue that I could hardly hear, because Nolan likes to blare his music up over important dialogue. Maybe it was just the Cinema sound system being extra enthusiastic, or maybe once again, a criticism that I've aimed at Nolan before, is that he really needs to edit his movies better and get an editor that doesn't make it hard for the viewer to hear what's being said. It is blatantly criminal in the sheer bad editing that this film suffers from.The film does have its good moments, although I would have to call them rare, but again the visual effects are splendid and is possibly the only reason why this film is a 6 for me, and not a 5 or lower. There literally some scenes in the film that made me go 'wow...' and look on with delight. It's for these scenes that you need to go and watch Interstellar, but be warned, that the rest of the film performs below its expectation.Major Gripe: Time for a major gripe, and I thought it would be the editing of the film, but no. It comes down to design. Now, I've read that there are those that liked the robots, TARS, and CASE. That's fine, and I'll admit the design is unusual and somewhat funky. Yet the positive reviewers probably don't or won't, look at the faults in design. Well I saw the fault in the design all too clear; In one particular scene, just after getting out of the shuttle after landing on a new planet, TARS is scene 'walking' for want of a better word, onto the planet. Yet I caught that moment when it awkwardly tried to maintain its balance. What was it doing with its left leg? I wondered to myself... And ever since I saw that strange fault, I couldn't let it go. The more I looked at its wobbly movements and its rather awkward looking design and its very human personality with its very human non-robotic voice, I just couldn't get into it that this was a robot. I kept on imagining a guy in a suit... and that's the problem.When you design a robot for a film, you need to get it across to the audiences that this is a robot. Not some strange puppet on a string or anything else, but a robot. Sadly Nolan failed in getting this across because of the voice being used, because of the very human personality and because of the rather awkward looking way it just went about. There was nothing about the robot that I honestly liked, it just didn't feel like one, and at no time in the film is it explained where the tech came from, impressive tech at that, yet it just didn't translate well onto the screen.Interstellar is a decent film. Is it worth the prestigious rating of 9.0 that most reviewers give it? I personally don't think so, and I think in a lot of cases such positive reviews come from the reviewer being dazzled with special effects and in a lot of cases that is the case. It happened with Gravity; people were so amazed at the effects they just threw 9's at it all day. Interstellar is not about any of that, it's about the story, and sadly, it lacks a decent one.","

"holloway-sarahjane","9 November 2014","Special effects are the real winner in this movie, not the plot, not the acting. Most of the story makes little sense and the characters are annoying, except for the ever charming Michael Caine. The plausibility factor was as poor as some 1950's sci-fi and less fun. Back to the Future was and is more interesting. I would have to say it was not a boring movie, but too much talking and teen angst out of adult scientists. Ann Hathaway has no place playing anyone with a PhD. The ""Dust Bowl"" effect was not terribly convincing, they could have made it seem a lot grimmer. There were too many ""that wouldn't happen"" moments for me, I couldn't suspend reality because they would keep mixing facts in and then do stuff that was pointless and unrealistic. The noise of the background was so loud often I couldn't understand the dialog, low bass organ music and rocket engine noise so loud my chair vibrated. The characters were doing things that didn't add to the story and just seemed immature, you almost couldn't root for the human race to survive.","

"Cinnyaste","10 November 2014","Somewhere on the path to juxtaposing the story of the imminent death by starvation of humanity on Earth against a desperate search for a new planetary home (hopefully to not similarly despoil), the authors of ""Interstellar"" forgot to consider the audience and instead created a far too long, far too arcane and far too pet film. ""Interstellar"" is a kissin' cousin to the equally pet, pseudo mind-blowing, con man sleight-of-hand ""Inception.""A bitter taste is left in the mouth by a self-satisfied script constantly trumpeting a specialness that, alas, is not at all special.Audiences have been beat to death by the tropes, plot elements and dialogue seen so many times before. For example, the ""Pursued By Demons Retired ______ Forced Back Into Service"" trope.Women, as in most films, are relegated to the back of the bus. When will writers and filmmakers wake up to the richness in woman's hearts and minds - even a cold scientist's ticker and noggin?Face-down-death awaits the character with the fewest lines and closeup. (Much like the Bic 'Red Shirts' in ""Star Trek"" you knew would never make it to the end credits.)An intelligent young woman becomes hysterical because Daddy's leaving, yet her intellect does not grasp his mission is important: To save her and the rest of the world. Beside, Daddy didn't explain, at least not on camera.Matt Damon resurrects from hypersleep to wreak havoc as in the hackneyed ""Don't Astronauts on ""The Twilight Zone"" Pass Basic Psych Tests?"" plot element.Don't forget the Dead Wife and Wise Grandpa tropes.Wonder is non-existent. That's quite a feat as few films have led us through a wormhole. ""Black Hole"" did a better job. At least the mysterious passage in Disney's opus didn't suggest injection into a globule borrowed from the coda of ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" (Also cobbed from Kubrick's masterpiece are the more human than humans (articulated) computers.)Cinematic corn served warm with a schmear of butter is quite delicious. Corn served cold by trying-too-hard actors sittin' on the porch waxin' philosophical is a dish best passed to the person sitting on your right.There are nonsensical interviews of dust storm survivors who describe what the special effects department has just shown. There's no lack of understanding why the run time is 169 minutes. The dogged determination to not self-edit and lose script pages underscores either Nolan's lack of being a good audience or not caring about audiences - the latter a quality indicative of too many contemporary filmmakers.The ending leads to head scratching that, in another film, would elicit laughs from the audience. Poltergeists my patootie!""Interstellar"" veers uncomfortably close to complete train wreck, but there are a few nice touches. While derivative, the articulated computers are cool. That mankind can solve mankind's problems without an advanced alien intelligence, God or other deus ex machina is the one original idea - and it's a good one.Save very few elements to recommend it, ""Interstellar"" is a really, really long bore pretending importance. There's nothing worse than films of that ilk.","

"james1844","8 November 2014","The problem is... Stellar is so complex and confusing you are at the mercy of tying together so many scientific issues you get bogged down in the constant slow dialog and the dragging delivery of the twists and turns of what has got to be the most complex multi-plotted movie I've seen in years. I sensed ""overkill"" of some scenes that seemed constantly drawn out that if I had a remote I would have fast forwarded through many parts. I am a big Sci-Fi movie lover and as such I will bring huge praise to the writers and producers of well made movies of this kind. Before going to see this much anticipated film that was given spectacular and high praise from several cites such as IMDb, I was dumbfounded by what appeared to be a movie almost impossible to find fault with in those reviews. Whats more this film was much too long (2 hrs 55 minutes) including previews of trailers. No human bladder should be put to such an ungodly test. Lastly I want to again point out that many reviews are suspect in this world of questionable truths of opinion.","

"aharmas","5 November 2014","Nolan does it again. He gives us a thought-provoking adventure with basis on the past, present, and possible future of humankind. It makes us ponder about how we came about, where and why we are experiencing the current state of affairs, and the possible outcome. Who is responsible for humankind's future? Who do we relate to and why? Are there any ""they"" out there to guide, help, protect us, or send us to our ultimate fate.""Interstellar"" follows the journey of a man who is selected to find a possible solution to our dying environment. He stumbles upon a secret, scientific project that might take him to another galaxy where he can find a suitable answer to our problems. What he is told, what happens, and what the others do is what makes the tale so interesting and exciting. However, this is not ""Star Wars"" or ""Close Encounters"". It is a original idea that goes beyond what others have hinted at before. What if we dared crossed that border? What if we pushed ourselves a little more? Where does the spiritual and the scientific intersect? Of course, there will be questions about theology, though we hardly hear the characters make any direct references to such entities, but we have a wonderful score that certainly reminds us of what is not being said.In order to get our interests, the outline is laid out, and Cooper (Matthew) is soon on his way to Saturn and the wormhole that will serve as a conduit to the other galaxy where there will be more choices and answers to our questions. Unfortunately, there might not be enough time to deal with the possibilities, and that is where the problem lies. On top of that, there are always surprises along the way, and both nature itself and human nature have a way of coming up with more variables than we care to deal with.Soon the pilot and scientists see themselves in worlds where both gravity, time, and energy take on different manifestations from what we are used to. Some storms are just much bigger and powerful than what we are accustomed to, and there is always hidden agendas, unexpected twists to the story, and our ability to try our hardest when things become really complicated.I truly enjoyed the way some natural events and emotions are explained in very detailed scientific lingo, which might prove fresh to some and too challenging to other members of the audience. What strikes me, too is that though the film appears to slow down for some of these exchanges, it never becomes boring. There is always the lure of mystery, of knowledge, and how the mind is thirsty for some sort of stimulation, and in this film, knowledge is power and salvation, and I found it invigorating and hopeful that books are prominently displayed here.We can see how technology allows Nolan to create a new series of visual and sound effects, which play an important part here, and it is very satisfying to see that space looks ""real"", and by the time we are taken through the wildest moments of the ride, we are not disappointed. In fact, the climax of the film is even more complex than expected because here is where technology, faith, and the will to survive blend quite nicely. Nolan keeps his characters real, even when it becomes more challenging to believe there is the possibility of another level to the way we understand the word ""dimension"".All of the performers do excellent work here, with Jessica and Matthew leading the pack. Caine, Burstyn, Hathaway and Damon do very good supporting work, and each one does his/her best to make the story's difficult parts believable and relatable. There is not going to be anyone in the audience who will not believe the way the laws of physics and biology are pushed to the limit because the structure of the film is very intelligent, never going beyond what we understand, and if still a bit incomprehensible, at least it lays the foundations for what might be a more concrete possibility in the future.""Interstellar"" will have you thinking, believing, and loving every minute those people are on the screen. We have a little bit of everything, and the balances are just right because even a power emotion like love is somehow explained in a logical way that will have skeptics believing that it is as real anything that scientists can fabricate in a lab. ""Interstellar"" shows another side of Science Fiction, making it more tangible, more real, more heartfelt, and way different from what we have seen before.","

"Pavan_Daggupati","7 November 2014","Interstellar is a jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring, beautiful, complex and thrilling adventure.The film is a mix of Spielberg's warmth, Kubrick's brain and Malick's beauty.Visually it is one of the best film ever made if not the best. Totally, is it the best film ever made? i don't know. A film of this scope and ambition is sure to have some narrative flaws here and there but it is beyond my ability to judge a film like this and find flaws in first viewing. May be i need to see it again to find any flaws, hell why should i find flaws while enjoyed it immensely. Performances were great. Hans Zimmer music was terrific and loud at times. Endurance docking and ghost subplot gave me chills. Some of the stuff is hard to understand like the Gravitational singularity, Relativity and 5 Dimensional space. But Nolan connected the dots between them very efficiently and mixed them with love and humanity. If you are a sucker for these things, the film will transcend you into it or else it feels overly sentimental. Don't miss it. I recommend you to watch it in IMAX if possible.","

"lasttimeisaw","22 November 2014","By no means I am a scientific geek, my days of tackling with science has been fortuitously truncated years ago, so putting aside all these heatedly discussed astrological concepts, to be specific, wormhole, black hole, tesseract, the fifth dimension and time travel relativity (thanks to the enormous contribution of Dr. Kip Thorne), INTERSTELLAR is a potent analogue of Nolan's previous stunning visual and conceptual extravaganza INCEPTION (2010, 9/10), which looks deep into the bizarre inner activity within one's dream realm, but this time, Nolan's scope is going the opposite direction, extended outwardly to the unknown universe and based on a more perceivable future of the earth's imminent doom (we are all the culprits of various degrees in this scenario), it is not just an awe-inspiring outer-space odyssey, in its dual storyline, the life on earth is phenomenally linked by human's primitive force - love. I didn't watch the film on an IMAX screen, which in Cairo is quite scarce, and Cairo is a big city, but I have no gripe to watch it on a normal 2D screen since it is fantastically overwhelming just the same. In the pre-space trip , ex-pilot-turned-farmer Cooper (McConaughey) is staying with his two children, Murph, short for Murphy (Foy) and Tom (Chalamet) with his father-in-law Donald (Lithgow), while their world is experiencing extreme weather catastrophe such as sand storms, the father-and-daughter bond between Cooper and Murph has been intensified through their similar attitude towards science and the supernatural episodes happened in Murph's room, where she claims there is a ""phantom"" using gravity to send her messages, which is such an ingenuous yet inconspicuous maneuver to foreshadows the mind-blowing twist in the black hole, and unthinkably it becomes the key to save all the humanity on earth. The emotional crunches are prepped with incredible performance, again, McConaughey is unbelievably trans-formative as the loving father who decide to reunite with Murph and keep his promises against all odds, his supreme reaction shots when reading messages for the past 23 years from Tom and Murph on earth are his Oscar-baiting moments, it seems the McConaussance has not been slowing down and one Oscar statue seems not enough at all. Mackenzie Foy plays the young Murph, Chastain is her adult version and Burstyn gives the final happy ending as the senior one. Chastain is a relentless fireball, formidably interprets the most arcane part (the telepathic revelation of who is the phantom?) which sometimes even challenges its own credibility, it is not a showy role for Chastain's caliber, nevertheless she is excellent in it, take one example, the minute facial nuances when Prof. Brand (Michael Caine) telling her the disturbing truth in his deathbed are handled with almost undetectable forbearance yet viewers can maximally sense the repercussions since it shakes all her belief in one second. Foy is equally brilliant as the young Murph, she sets a solidified base with Cooper, which sustains the mainstay of the film's critical emotional core and guides us through the transcendent experiences with Cooper, and a new child star is officially born. Hathaway's Brand, although second billed, surprisingly doesn't have too much to offer as the co-pilot, sometimes even becomes a corny nuisance (poor Wes Bentley!), there is another type of father-daughter undercurrent (she and Caine) which the film largely dodges. During Cooper's expedition to find suitable planet for earthlings, there is the punned ""Murphy's Law"" effect subsequently occurs, Matt Damon's classified cameo is well-kept from the trailer and his appearance further cements his recent string of involvement with Sci-Fi genre (after THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU 2011, 6/10, ELYSIUM, 2013, 7/10 and Terry Gilliam's THE ZERO THEOREM 2013, next year he will be in Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN with Chastain), his Dr. Mann is the revered pioneer in the project, however it is through him, Nolan builds the only real villain (arguably Caine the big fat liar is condemnable as well), who succumbs to human frailties under the extreme condition, his motive is understandable, any of us could make the same move under his condition, that's why the film is so precious, one has to overcome all the innate barriers to achieve something extraordinary, say without this commitment with Murph, without the uninhibited love for her daughter (poor Tom, his father never even mention him at all), maybe Plan B is the future for human race, and the cruelty is freshly in our face. After GRAVITY (2013, 9/10), we reach a new monumental peak for the cosmic cinematography, pairing with a new DP Hoyte Van Hoytema (from HER 2013, 8/10; TINKER TAILER SOLIDER SPY 2011, 6/10, THE FIGHTER 2010, 8/10 and LET THE RIGHT ONE IN 2008, 9/10), Nolan's galactic wonders are sufficiently groundbreaking, the three planets they visit bear simplistic topography grafted with inconceivable excesses, and the final homeland, the distorted proportion, all evokes the striking variations in INCEPTION. And if Alfonso Cuarón can win BEST DIRECTOR for GRAVITY, Nolan is much more deserving, I am firmly standing behind Nolan's back this, it is a cinema-goer's ultimate luck to have filmmakers like Nolan dares to make these ""impossible and grand venture"" to enlighten our imagination and edify our own consciousness as a human being in this imperfect world, with the prowess of love we all possess, however small we are individually, there is hope always beckoning, eternally.","

"paulclaassen","15 December 2021","The film's logline sounds so simple, yet this is the type of movie one can ponder over and analyze for hours. Earth - and Humanity - is reaching a stage when resources are depleted, and the ozone layer is damaged. With technology rapidly advancing the way it does, they might indeed start looking for alternatives to Earth. 'Interstellar' explores this to perfection.Matthew McConaughey stars as Cooper, a farmer who is also a trained NASA pilot and engineer. Without realizing it, he has been trained for the biggest mission of his life - and humanity's. His character is well set-up as a caring, loving father - a man on the verge of making the greatest decision he could ever make. 'Interstellar' is a deeply emotional film spanning several years, and will have yourself ask what you would have done under similar circumstances.The film features some stunning visuals, and a great score. It also offers great character development. Despite the film running almost three hours long, it is never boring and captivated me from beginning to end. This is completely and utterly fascinating, and food for thought.The ending will leave you with a lot of questions, but definitely worth sitting through. This is a masterpiece I'd watch again and again.","

"mnoble1-2","21 January 2015","Science Fiction is not an excuse for lazy writing and sloppy direction.Starts off showing flowing fields of thriving green vegetation – constantly bombarded by massive dust storms and yet continues to grow and thrive. Then, we are supposed to believe that a drone – one that can fit in the back of a pickup truck has enough solar cells to power 'an entire farm.'After that, Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan (Screenplay) expect us to believe that a retired NASA pilot, who never left Earth orbit and survived crashing his orbital spacecraft, is more experienced to go on an interstellar voyage than the astronauts that have studied and prepared for the voyage. Okay, I'll admit this one is possible, but not likely.The first planet they decide to visit – the one so close to a black hole it has significant time dilation – the one covered in water and deluged with huge waves every hour, (one of which destroyed the original exploration spacecraft and killed the pilot – not detected by the spacecraft instruments, by the way) is a prime candidate for colonization.Then, when the next huge wave arrives, Christopher Nolan (Director) makes us watch as one of the astronauts stands by the spacecraft door for several seconds (plenty of time to get in the spacecraft) watching the wave approach and is washed away. Why did he stand around waiting outside the spacecraft in the first place! Nonsensical!The next thing the Nolan brothers expect us to believe is that an astronaut who volunteered for what was probably a one-way mission suddenly goes crazy, becomes a coward, falsifies data, and turns into a murderer! Were his rescuers going to leave him on the planet to die after they found out the planet was uninhabitable! Don't think so!Later, this same coward astronaut decides to take a chance and risk his life opening the spacecraft hatch after warnings that doing so would cause a blowout. I guess we supposed to believe he is that crazy!","

"benjaminburt","24 August 2017","Interstellar is both loved and hated among audiences. It interests me. How can the same film be both praised and derided so intensely? Is it a masterpiece with some obvious flaws, or is it a mediocre film that is propped up by fanboy-ism and bandwagon-ing? For starters, I would just like to say my opinion. I think the movie is fine. It's a little too drawn-out and has bizarre elements, and I think that the message of love is way out of place in such a film.Some people have pointed out glaring flaws in the story and characters, and for them, they are confused and angry that such a film could be considered one of the greatest of all time.So, how did Nolan do it? Well, I believe he tapped into Zeitgeist, or the 'spirit of the times.' He made a perfect storm of a movie, using elements that, on their own are not very special, but combined, they reflect the values of this age.Let's break it down. First off: space. The works of Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye have fired up new interest in space, and people loved the realistic take on the genre. Second: the message of love. Western Culture almost pivots now around the fulcrum of love, and hate crimes are now considered the most abominable atrocity one could commit.Layer on top of this the cinematography, direction, and style of Nolan, which fanboys have been eating up since Memento. And while I like almost all Nolan films, I think Interstellar is his worst, featuring Nolan-isms dialed up to 11, with philosophical stances on love, life, time, destiny, and humanity's position in the universe.Everyone has a right to like this film if they so choose, and there are reasons to like it. Just please, don't deny the fact that it's pretentious, overly long, and contrived. Recognize that but say that that didn't stop you from enjoying it.","

I left theatre shaking violently, crying and having I think 150 BPM. Every single piece of the movie from the story itself, visuals, music and acting is a perfect combination and perfection. I even can't find right word to give you proper review (partly because English is not my native)and summarization won't give the movie justice. The only thing I regret that I watched it dubbed (though in my country dubbing is really good) I advice t go see the movie alone on yourself as I did and it will pull you in from the first frame to this epic journey!P.S.

"RevRonster","10 November 2014","I'm a big fan of Christopher Nolan's work and was really excited to see ""Interstellar."" While the film started very strong and was loaded with emotional promise, the story just lost me and I quickly found myself growing bored with it.Yes, the film is visually stunning, Matthew McConaughey is awesome in his role, and the film has some very entertaining robots that provide some light-hearted and cool moments, the story's emotional impact was lost due to Nolan showing off how much he knew about science and time. While what we are presented with is interesting and neat to learn, they weren't presented in a way I felt was meshing with the story. They felt more like intermissions where the story is stopped and the audience is forced to pull out their textbooks to learn about what is going to happen. It felt like Nolan was stopping the emotional course of the story to show you all how hard he knows science.And while I loved McConaughey in the film, I felt a lot of the performances weren't coming close to what he was brining. Heck, even some of the characters come off as superfluous as they lack any real depth and feel tacked on in order to achieve the next plot device—for example, the surprise addition of a well known actor comes off as a needless villain that did little to really create tension and felt like something that was thrown in at the last minute.I still really enjoy Nolan's work and will forever admit that the visuals were gorgeous and McConaughey was very enjoyable in the film—and yes, I will say that all the science Nolan drops on us is very intriguing and cool but, in the end, I just couldn't invest myself in the story. It starts very strong but once the story took to the stars and traveling through black holes, the emphasis went from deep emotion to deep thought and that hurt the overall presentation for me. Science is pretty awesome but I just didn't see a balance of getting the human factor and the academic factor right. They didn't seem to gel and that kept me from getting fully invested in the journey to save the human race.Hello! The name is Rev.

"sydmwswy","7 January 2023","The story of the film is very touching. If we remove the music from the movie, it will still be a good movie, even a better movie, maybe even a weak point. Well now if we remove the music we see that it is longer. And maybe it will be boring for the audience who likes this big movie several times. The final sequence of the film turns into a package full of long shots. Such a show is repeated in different parts of the film. Even in the views we have from space.Nolan sprinkles a silver and gold color on these shots. Men in spacesuits look much bigger than normal. Matt Damon is not believable enough. But it is good. The sequences size are too long. Nolan tries to make it bearable with music, but he doesn't succeed. I am not against this. But this work also requires a slower rhythm. The pictures are very beautiful. And they often don't look like promotional teasers...","

"frezeframe","7 November 2014","""Insomnia"" is one of the top 200 films ever made. ""Inception"" is one of the top 100 films ever made.""Interstellar"" is one of the top 25 films ever made. All of Nolan's films are great. But this is better. This is something else. Granted, Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is one of the top 10 comic book films ever made, but Interstellar takes Nolan's career to a level few have achieved. This film forever cements Christopher Nolan's place in cinema history as it will no doubt be one of the highest Academy Award nominated films in history (we shall see this upcoming March). I feel sorry for the film ""Gravity."" That film was so ground breaking in the Sci Fi/Space genre... but it only held the torch for less than a year. Interstellar blows Gravity away, like the '91 Bulls would have overpowered and embarrassed any class B college basketball team. Gravity is amateur hour compared to Interstellar- it's not even the same sport. Bold statements, I know but anyone reading this will eventually see the film, and you'll understand what I mean. Interstellar is truly a masterpiece for any generation and will be considered a pillar of achievement a century from now, much like Star Wars, Jaws, 2001 and Lord of the Rings are permanent pillars of cinema achievement. This is one of those films that changes the conversation. There has never been any movie like it, and there will never be another one like it- only imitators. Having said all that, do I really feel like Interstellar is a 10 out of 10? No, of course not. I'd say it's a 9.5. So for IMDb, that means 10. It's not the best film ever made, but it's in the same conversation as The Matrix, Star Wars, Blade Runner, E.T., T2, Avatar, 2001, etc. From this point forward, you can't have a conversation about ground breaking visual effects films, or ground breaking space dramas without mentioning Interstellar. It's that innovative. It's so innovative, in fact, that the slow start, cliché elements and improbable story set up have absolutely no effect on the film once it's over. That is rare my friends. That is a film worth seeing! Interstellar starts out slow and is overly sentimental as you'll read in a lot of reviews. You'll read that because it's true. Some of the dialog is off and the initial premise is not believable. Matthew McConaughey is one of our finest actors, but it's just not probable that an old NASA test pilot turned farmer would be seeked out by the now ""secret"" NASA who was looking for him but didn't know where to find him, and once he happens upon them by a supernatural premonition, they put him on a rocket ship a few days later with no exercise, conditioning, or up to date training. Oh and he only lives an hour drive away from NASA's secret facility. Usually a film with those kind of strikes in the first 20 minutes... you're heading for trouble. But Interstellar starts slow and keeps getting better, and better, and better, and better... until the entire audience's jaw is on the floor (To see what I mean, give a glance at the audience during the act 3 climax and you'll see something you don't see very often. Total immersion. And if you don't watch this in front of an audience on IMAX, you've missed the point.) By the time Act 2 begins, it's so powerful that none of Act 1 matters. Again, that is so rare. Only a master filmmaker can design a film in such a way. Act 3 is where cinema history is made. It wouldn't be proper to give any spoilers here, as this is a must see film. I will only say that Act 1 is good, but partially flawed... and Act 3 is so strong that it makes the plot holes of Act 1 totally irrelevant. That never happens. Don't miss Interstellar if you have a chance to see it on IMAX! But regardless of how you see it, or when; it's worth your time and money and you'll be hard pressed to find a better new movie, over the next few years- especially with the all time low quality of Hollywood blockbusters and special effects showcases. Few directors have a command of the craft of filmmaking like Christoper Nolan does. In fact, I don't think you could say there is anyone better than Christopher Nolan working right now. He may not have the body of work Spielberg, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, Fincher or Soderberg have... but in the sci fi genre, Nolan is currently the best filmmaker in the world. Or you could say he's second to only James Cameron. Interstellar is a gift to us all on the same level as Avatar. Enjoy!","

"wellthatswhatithinkanyway","6 September 2015","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the future, Earth has become a pretty sad, desolate place, where resources have run scarce and machines have taken over much. A space time continuum in outer space is discovered, around the planet of Saturn, that humanity can ascend to in order to begin a new life away from the rapidly diminishing Earth. Cooper (a continually, frustratingly mumbling Matthew McConaughey) a simple farmer, is chosen to man the space craft that will save Earth, along with co pilots Romilly (David Gyasi) and Brand (Anne Hathaway) and a talking robot thing that looks like a fridge, by the name of TARS (Bill Irwin.) But as the mission unfolds, they discover secrets and lies that threaten to plunge them into conflict amongst each other, I guess. They're possibly meant to do something else, and something else happens, but by the end (which, given the length, I'm surprised I stuck around till), the whole film had just so gone over my head I might have missed it.At the start of the new century, a young, promising director called Christopher Nolan emerged, an eager and hungry young mind that delivered Memento, an intelligent and original thriller that took a far flung concept and played with your mind and demanded your full attention to the end. He followed this with Insomnia, not only one of my all time favourite thrillers, but also one of my favourite films, that I still love to this day. After these two relatively independent offerings, he established himself as one of the top new names, and possibly Hollywood was happy to throw a lot of cash at him, and let him run wild and indulge his darkest, most inner most relentless cerebral musings, and from here on in, he went and delivered increasingly lengthy productions that bombarded the minds of his audience with so much anomaly and detail, even turning Batman into a challenging and complex ride three times. Even his comparatively short 2006 effort The Prestige seemed lost in it's own mystery and aggrandisement. But with Interstellar, he's just completely surpassed himself.Clocking up at nearly three hours, the film, in the time you spend with it (and you really do have to make quite a commitment) truly rakes up every last second of it's stated running time, and that would mean there's a lot to be taken in, and much you might have to describe and re-live about it afterwards. It could be quite difficult, but actually you can sum the film Interstellar up with one word: over. It's over ambitious, over indulgent, over bloody long!, over bearing, over cerebral over complicated and, just over whelming. And by the end, after grudging with it for so long, you'll be glad it's 'over.' Seriously, if you manage to get through it with out getting up to stretch your legs at least once while it's still on, you should get a telegram from the queen! I can't believe it took me so long to see it, but I'm certainly glad I missed it in the cinema.An intelligent concept is fine, but it can't give the audience no room to breathe like this. It's a shame, because if Nolan had delivered something a little more condensed, the intricate plot the film had to explore and any intelligent message it had to deliver could have been better absorbed by the viewer, instead of being lost in a sea of bafflement. Sadly, the best praise I can end up giving it is some fabulous cinematography, in space and at sea that sticks in the mind.Inception was too much, really, but I took it as the most intellectual film ever made and kind of have a soft spot for it, but this is just too much. Nolan can be thankful his films haven['t lost their spark and edge like fellow contemporary M Night Shyamalan, but he really needs to stop being so ruthlessly anti-mainstream and pelting his audience with such lengthy, cerebral exposition, or he might lose them forever. And stop least stop making them so dour and humourless to boot. In terms of a modern, space bound adventure, it goes without saying Alfonso Couran's much trimmer Gravity does a better job of being smart and in orbit. **","

"851222","9 November 2014","Greetings from Lithuania.""Interstellar"" to simply put, is a magnificent motion picture. It is a close call masterpiece (surely a classic). The whole hype wasn't just a hype, it's true, and you have to witness it on the big screen to truly appreciate it. It has everything a true sci- fi movie should have and everything that a truly great motion picture must have. Everything here works on the highest level. The music (without doubts, a locked Oscar nomination), sound / sound effects (two possible Oscar winners), acting, directing, script special effects (a sure nominee) are a top notch, and combined with realistic sci-fi ideas, this movie is must see. It has to go down as one of (if not THE) very best science fiction movies off all times.Overall, ""Interstellar"" is as good as movies goes. It has everything to held you glued to the screen for almost 3 hours, but trust me, watching ""Interstellar"" you will be delivered to a movie magic without a wormhole help.","

"cineastFGD","27 August 2015","OK, as a start I'm not a scientist, I don't know much about astrophysics or physics in general, so you can imagine if someone like me is disturbed by the scientific level of this movie, it might mean something. I don't know whether the farmers' association of Iowa sponsored the movie, but the starting point is that due to some mysterious circumstances, sand storms and droughts plague humanity. And of all possible crops, corn, one of the least drought resistant crops, is the one to survive? This is laughable. Also, the nitrogen level in the air increases mysteriously, although we never learn why and what might cause it. The only hint we get is that our appetite for electronic gadgets might have caused this situation. OK, right! Strange enough there is nothing scientists can do about it, or they all have given up hope and now believe in Ronald Reagan playing Neil Armstrong in 'Moonlanding II'. Except for a top-secret NASA project that seeks to find a new world humanity can destroy, and that can make space rockets start unnoticed by anybody in the middle of the US. This group is apparently so short on personnel that they immediately recruit a guy, who just accidentally stumbles into their headquarter, as an astronaut. The mere fact that he once used to be a pilot out matters all missing training that astronauts usually go through before going into space. Although the crew starts out on a pretty standard 20th century space rocket, they magically transfer into a hyper-modern long distance space ship, that somehow hangs around unmanned in earth's orbit. The newly recruited pilot - having worked as a farmer for years - neatly fits into the hyper-modern apparatus without the need of any training or upgrading - some people are just gifted and act on pure instinct. We are then explained the concept of a wormhole with a piece of paper, before we, after some turmoil - caused by primitive human sentiments, such as love and aggression -, somehow end up in a black hole. At this point, my patience was drawing thin and I only occasionally took a glimpse at the film. The hero-pilot/instinct-astronaut can enter the black hole unprotected and even get out of it unharmed. Inside the black hole - which strangely enough is not black at all, but resembles a kaleidoscope on LSD - he quickly solves the formula for gravity with the help of a fellow astronaut- who happened to be dead, before he reemerges as a friend of some mysterious 5-dimensional creatures (who, by the way, remain completely mysterious all over the film). The hero- pilot/instinct-astronaut then transmits the gravity formula to his daughter on earth via Morse code (heaven forbid, if you think how long it takes just to Morse S O S, then imagine to Morse the expression ""Double integral from minus infinity to one hundred""). The genius daughter of the hero-astronaut immediately decodes the information by throwing paper sheets around and saves humanity by creating a 5 dimensional room in space (that looks pretty three dimensional) as a copy of the earth, except that there is grass on the sky (to give us an idea of the 5th dimension) ... well, if you have lost track by now don't worry, watching the movie will leave you equally puzzled. By NOT watching it, you'll save yourself the extended boring scenes of rocket wings that inflate this unedited masterpiece to nearly 3! hours, the emotional drama, and Anne Hathaway's monologue about Love, the misunderstood force that breaks all boundaries and overcomes all spaces, cringe worthy. All in all, most probably the worst sci-fi movie I've ever watched. Compared to the pseudo-science and illogic of this movie, the guys from Star Trek really appear quite believable.","

"briancham1994","25 May 2020","MY BACKGROUND:
Considering all the intense feelings around Christopher Nolan that often rear their enraged heads through online amateur reviews, I must profess where I stand from the outset. I am neither a ""fanboy"" nor a ""hater"" of the Nolan brand. I prefer his work up to and including The Prestige, but not much of his work afterwards, so any overall attachment balances out. I don't feel as if I have something to prove when watching or discussing his films.That said, I am a science fiction fan (""fan"" with a lowercase ""f"" if you know what I mean; don't expect me at the next Comic-Con) so I thought this might make for interesting viewing. Lately I did some layman reading on cosmology for an unrelated project, so either I knew enough to grasp the scientific concepts in the film or I was delusional enough to believe so.THOUGHTS:
Not impressed.We start off with a dry, dusty, dismal, dying future where the protagonist (played by a perpetually bored Matthew McConaughey) struggles to keep up harvests on his family farm. We are shown (i.e. beaten on the head by) suggestions that a ""ghost"" is pushing books off his daughter's bookshelf. At that point I hoped that the climax would not involve the typical sci-fi transcendence of space and time, with the protagonist becoming this ""ghost"" and using his new-found cosmic powers to push some books around. But more on this later.From that point the film reveals two of its biggest flaws - bad pacing and bad characters. The family spends a long time going through exposition, bonding, baseball, education issues and hacking an Indian drone but never build much of a substantial relationship in the viewer's mind. It just serves to repeatedly hammer in the superficial point that the protagonist is an all-American family man who loves his daughter, but not much else.After a very long time we finally get to something related to space and the premise when the protagonist stumbles upon a top secret NASA base. The scientists all unquestioningly conclude that his finding of the base must constitute advice from magical gravity beings (what a scientific deduction) and hire him as a space pilot for a world-saving mission almost on-the-spot. Yet even after launch, the film still drags on to a degree I haven't seen since The Lord of the Rings trilogy. What follows is more plodding filler scenes in orbit, near Saturn, in a lab and so on. Due to the effects of relativity, each hour passing on a watery planet they encounter is the same as seven years passing on Earth; due to the effects of slow pacing, each hour watching this movie certainly felt like seven years too. And this is coming from someone who could tolerate the pacing of Solaris!At some point on the water planet a crew member dies, but I don't remember his name, appearance or role since they were all interchangeable humans. At no point did I care about these bland, personality-deprived non-characters. This extended to the maudlin moments where the protagonist would mope over his daughter or vice versa, which just felt like shoehorned emotion without any real heart or connection. Instead of experiencing the stakes of aging, absence or the fate of the human species, I just wished for the plot to get somewhere.The gravity of the mission never really weighs in on the audience (excuse the puns) as the characters always find ways to subsume it with their personal concerns. The protagonist never shuts up about his family and never fails to base his mission decisions on their fate only. Okay, we get it, you care about your family. Can we move on now? The primary plan of Anne Hathaway's character turns out to be chasing THE POWER OF LOVE™. A stranded scientist played by Matt Damon jeopardises the mission and attempts to murder the protagonist to find a way off the planet. This may be intentional but it's hard to hold any hope for humanity when these expeditions seem to be staffed by the least professional personnel available.Near the end, the protagonist decides that he must hurl himself and a robot into the nearest black hole and send the recorded data back to Earth. He is convinced that this will work even though they establish that nothing can escape a black hole and their craft has had no success in communicating back. If the plan succeeds, the protagonist's daughter can save humanity by using the data to reconcile General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. Apparently Loop Quantum Gravity doesn't already do that (did the science advisor believe LQG to be less plausible than five-dimensional bulk gravity ghosts?). Besides, if one end of a wormhole is a black hole, shouldn't they have this data already?So he executes this plan and we get the non-twist that he becomes the ""ghost"" from the beginning of the film, which should surprise nobody. Well, who else would it be? The daughter herself? (which was my backup prediction). Using THE POWER OF LOVE™ which transcends space and time (groan), he sends the data back to his daughter and she saves humanity. There's an epilogue with a cheap reunion but it just fills up time.Lest anyone think that I hate this film through and through, it does have its good moments. Even if the opening scenes dragged on for too long, they worked well to establish a dreary world where human civilisation is stagnating painfully rather than the usual sci-fi apocalypse which happens in an instant. The CGI sequences of the wormhole travel and tesseract were gorgeous and unique with interesting visual concepts like light distortion and higher dimensions. Unlike many others I found the soundtrack to be rousing and powerful rather than needlessly bombastic. It's a shame that none of it accompanied scenes with emotion of equal intensity.WHAT WOULD I DO?
Hypothetically, if I could change anything about Interstellar, what would it be?As I'm sure anyone can infer by now, my biggest problem with the movie is the pacing. There is not enough content to last for 169 minutes; cutting down to a typical runtime of 90-120 minutes would suffice. The beginning spent too long lingering on Earth introducing the setting and characters without setting up the premise. I would have majorly restructured the film so it immediately starts out in space (like Sunshine) and builds up the characters and backstory through regular, well-timed flashbacks (like Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours or LOST). These would cover all of the crew members, not just the protagonist, who would have their own distinct personalities, motivations, roles and backgrounds (more than just ""I miss my father"" and ""I am a family man""). This would give context to their behaviour and interactions in the ""present"". We should care more about these characters, who they are and whether they succeed.At the start of the third act, the cutaways would stop going to the past and start showing the time period when the children have grown up. Until this point the messages from Earth don't get through, so we don't get pointless teary moments until the relationships have been properly built up for the audience.The missions should be more coherent and less improvised. There is a proper briefing. Nobody is hired on-the-spot. The previous exploration through the wormhole used orbital and aerial robots like in Alien Planet. Who is trying to find what, where, and report it back to whom, before what deadline? Stick to one thing. Cut out the time-wasting scenario with Matt Damon's scientist.The general concept behind the tesseract climax is fine, though it is executed as a predictable deus ex machina. Don't bring in ghosts, gravity messages and trans-dimensional wormhole benefactors at the beginning. That sort of mystery is on-the-nose and the audience expects it to be explained eventually, negating any potential surprise. A good plot twist should be completely unexpected. I would make any climactic time travel explain events that the audience never realised needed an explanation, but make sense in hindsight.The time travelling actions should be more interesting than pushing books and sending data. Maybe the protagonist interacts directly with the future, or interacts with the past of a hitherto unrelated character, or something of the sort. Maybe the actions of the protagonist directly lead to human civilisation transcending space-time, so the tesseract construction concept doesn't just come out of nowhere. It also needs to feel justified thematically. The rest of the film had a strong emphasis on physics concepts and mentioned relativity a lot, which jars with the sudden revelation of infinite cosmic bookshelves inside a survivable black hole. Starting with the same fantasy tone would make the film consistent and make the climax more palatable.The epilogue is unnecessary. The protagonist already reunited with his daughter through all the time travel ghost stuff, which was cathartic enough. His actions have more meaning if they culminate in an ultimate sacrifice, so he should die in the black hole's singularity.Some other minor changes I would have made:Show alien landscapes that actually look alien, not just the ocean and Iceland.Cut out the Disney-esque, New Age, hippie nonsense about THE POWER OF LOVE™.Stop repeating that poem so many damn times.Make the robot less annoying.FINAL VERDICT:
Pretty sights and a booming soundtrack can't make up for dull pacing, flat characters, a predictable plot and contrived cheese.4.5/10","

"ivanmessimilos","9 November 2014","I will not lie. If you had one year ago asked me ,personally, what is the most anticipated movie of 2014, the answer would be this film. About this film we did not know much, which says a lot about trailers that are now recorded as they have revealed almost the entire movie. In short, our planet Earth is dying and we can save it only through special mission that travels far into space. What is interesting is that the film is based on the theory of relativity and black holes and on film worked physicist Kip Thorne as a producer which gives a weight. The film lasts 169 minutes, which is practically three hours, but not a single minute was not boring. With this film Nolan did what Kubrick done with 2001 Odyssey 1968, he was ahead of his time. I know some will say that the problem is a big difference in technology and budget, but I find it incomparably. Clearly, there are numerous references to Odyssey during the movie and I was pleased when I saw the link, however, Nolan brings something new, something of his own and therefore I consider him a genius. Visually, the film is perfect. When watching it, then you do not see the CGI effects, you actually viewing space! Of course, in this film there is a turnover that perhaps many will not like but I am absolutely thrilled with a twist and the end of the film. It's very ambitious, I admit, it causes you to think and use our gray cells, but is it not that the goal of the film (or should be)? Why do we like movies? Why do we go to the cinemas? I am absolutely delighted with all aspects of the film, starting with the lead actor, story, visual effects, music, plot and ending. I'm not even a little bit disappointed despite great anticipation and so pure a ten from me.","

"petra_ste","5 June 2015","When it comes to endings and general philosophy of storytelling, you can distinguish between two kinds of fiction.The first is soothing, consolatory: characters may face dangers but at the end order is restored. The second is more problematic and offers no easy resolution; by the time the story is over, events have taken a major toll on those involved - maybe they have lost what they wanted, or their achievement is implied to be short-lived. Maybe they wonder if it was even worth it at all.The first kind of fiction is Spielberg, the other Kubrick; the first is Nolan of Memento, the other Nolan of Interstellar.Now, both kinds have their place and there is nothing wrong with more lighthearted fare; in fact, most of the time I'd rather watch a crackling popcorn flick like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars than a fine but bleak film like, say, The Deer Hunter. The trouble is when you try to mix these two kinds: the result will have major tonal problems.See Interstellar: in a story about entropy and loss, the kind of conclusion this film dishes out just feels wrong after the somber 150 minutes preceding it. It's fluffy and tone-deaf.Pity, because I was enjoying the movie. Acting is effective, with a solid McConaughey and an unusual supporting role for Damon; special mention to young Mackenzie Foy, who is fine as the protagonist's daughter.At its best, Interstellar provides moment of awe (the oceanic planet), compelling dilemmas, tension and pathos (the scene with Cooper leaving in bad terms with his daughter is moving); exposition is clunky-but-interesting in an Inception kind of way. But the movie lost me with its last act.When Hathaway's character (an astronaut) states, unironically, that in our universe love is a force stronger than time and space and then she turns out to be right... well, I'm both religious and a big softie so I should be on board with that... it is, however, both too bluntly expressed and turns into an ending which feels similar to the maudlin Nolan provided in The Dark Knight Rises, only it's even more inappropriate here.6,5/10","

"asda-man","18 November 2014","children I shall be talking about Interstellar. But before I do, I think I better give you a little context, just to show how high my expectations were for this film. I love Christopher Nolan. I am a Nolanite, or Nolanoid, or whatever people who like Christopher Nolan are called. I've pretty much loved every film he's ever done. It confuses me when people slag him off because he's clearly the best writer/director to be working on mainstream blockbuster films since Steven Spielberg, only I think that his films are much better than Steven's.His films are only so thrilling because of the intimacy he creates between the audience and the characters. As soon as I heard Christopher Nolan's next film was a sci-fi film called, Interstellar, I was excited. I was so excited that I only treated myself to one viewing of the teaser trailer and first trailer. It was enough, I was sold and I didn't want to see any other trailer, because I wanted to know and see as little as possible.I decided that Interstellar needed to be seen in IMAX, so I booked my ticket to see Interstellar on the biggest screen in the UK. Even though the film had garnered some mixed reviews (I was hoping for full-on rave ones, like when The Dark Knight and Inception came out) I still put my trust into Christopher to deliver me something extraordinary. I don't know if it's the gigantic screen talking, but Interstellar absolutely delivered.This was the best experience I've ever had at the cinema. The huge screen and ear-popping sound made the experience incredibly intense and by the end of it, I felt like I had been for a little trip out in space. I'm not sure if this will translate quite so well on your TV screen at home, however the film is unmissable whatever you choose to see it on. Whilst a lot of the film does rely on extraordinary visuals and heart-stopping set-pieces, at its heart it's an intimate family drama which suggests that your children are your one and only important universe.I was absolutely sucked into the film from the moment it started. The stuff before Matthew goes into space is probably some of the best stuff in the film. We learn so much about Coop and he becomes a worthy character to invest three hours into (three hours which fly by, I might add). There's a strong focus on the relationship between Coop and his daughter, and it's this relationship which drives the film right up to, and including, its jaw-dropping conclusion. The first hour is also quite funny too, which was a nice surprise as Nolan doesn't normally dabble in too much humour.There's a really emotional scene where Coop wants to say goodbye to his daughter, who he doesn't know when he's going to see again, before his space travels. It's beautifully acted by both Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy and is at the powerful centre of the whole film. After this the film adopts an entirely new setting. Literally. We're blasted off into space and the fun really begins. The less you know about the space scenes, the better, as it's a lot of fun to try and work out just where the film is going! Suffice to say that Interstellar is jam-packed with eye-popping visuals and intense thrills which dwarf last year's Gravity into a speck of space dust by comparison.With The Dark Knight Rises, Christopher proved that he could direct on a big scale and Interstellar is his biggest yet. He has an ambition which most directors lack and instead of kicking him down for it, we should be nurturing it! Interstellar presents us with new and exciting ideas which colossally blow other mainstream films out of the water. The action is also elevated to unreachable new heights thanks to Hans Zimmer's astonishing score. It's a haunting piece of music that will be ringing in your head for hours after the film has finished. He's left the big drums and strings behind and re-invented himself with a bizarre church organ which perfectly matches the dark atmosphere of the film.A lot of people have expressed a strong disliking to the final 40 minutes of Interstellar. I can see why as up until then the film is more or less possible to understand. It's complex, but it's still easy enough to follow. However, Christopher completely rips up the rule book and Interstellar goes seriously barmy in the last 40 minutes. Personally, I loved the third act and it just goes to show the sheer creativity and ambition which Christopher Nolan has going inside his head. I found it all very interesting both on a visual and intellectual level. I don't understand it all, but I have my theories and I'm sure that there will be a mountain of theories cropping up on the interweb.Interstellar is a truly remarkable experience. It boasts awesome ideas and visuals, but it never forgets its heart. I'm a tough cookie to make cry, but I'm not going to lie (ooh poetry!) there were three occasions when I had tears filling up in my eyes. There are some astonishingly powerful and moving scenes in there which reminds me why I go to the cinema. I don't just want crazy visuals and excitement, I want to be moved and I want to be invested in characters so that I care what happens to them at the end. Interstellar more than achieves that.I'll need to give it another watch to work out where I'd put it on Christopher Nolan's mesmerising filmography, but he hasn't let me down. I hope that Interstellar is seen as a sci-fi classic in years to come because it really does deserve that accolade.Read more weird, dazzling and uncut reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com","

"bosporan","20 March 2022","Unfortunately it is protracted and drawn out. Kudos for 'showing-not-telling', but there are so many stretches of uninteresting dialogue. Everybody plays their part well - the whole is less than the sum of the parts. Not sure why this is - the cast is strong with good actors I have enjoyed before. Perhaps it is the pretension of becoming the new 2001 overriding the need to make a compelling movie.","

"jaimemedina-36288","7 June 2021","There's so much going on in this movie. There are so many great performances; there's a beautiful moral, and a lesson or two we can all take to heart. Please forgive the pun if I observe that this is a multi dimensional achievement.I'll not analyze the physics as Thorne has done that sufficiently. And to a person EVERYONE in the cast turns in a great performance.There are so many ways I love this movie: as a movie buff, as a lover of science, as a thinker and a dreamer, as someone concerned about our world, and as a father...I just don't know what more I could ask from a movie. The only thing that comes to mind... a sequel.","

"DareDevilKid","16 November 2014","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 5/5 starsChristopher Nolan has reached deep into the stars to tell a story about mankind's demise and refusal to go quietly into the night. Here is a director whose name has, quite literally, become synonymous with realism. The Nolanisation of cinema, which made the gloomy streets of Gotham a bridge between the fantastical and the commonplace, now grounds countless fancies within the mud of our reality. With ""Interstellar"", Nolan inverts expectation once again, with a film rooted in the regularity of mathematics homework but spliced with the fantastic. The film charts a course in the latest theories in quantum physics and other space-related sciences to tell a story that engages and entertains viewers. It also goes to exacting lengths to meticulously depict the theory of relativity — vetted by executive producer and renowned astrophysicist, Kip Thorne.Opening, on a dusty model of the shuttle Atlantis, the film's near- future setting sees humanity starving and devoid of hope. Eking out an existence in a post-millennial Dust Bowl, Matthew McConaughey's Cooper and his two children lead a life of agrarian survivalism. But in Cooper we find a new man cut from old cloth - an all-American hero. Played with a drawling, Texan swagger underpinned by startling emotional depth, he is Nolan's most traditional lead to date, embodying the wide-eyed wonder of the Director's youth; a man for whom we are ""explorers and pioneers, not caretakers"", who casts his lot among the stars as the human race's last, best hope.With the ailing Blue Planet left behind, Interstellar shifts smoothly into second gear. According to ""Interstellar's"" on-board astrophysicist, Kip Thorne, the spherical wormhole (it's three- dimensional, obviously) and the spinning event horizon of the film's black hole (named Gargantua) are mathematically modeled and true to life. Sitting before a 100-foot screen, though, you won't give a toss about equations because Nolan's starscape is the most mesmerizing visual of the year. Gargantua is as captivating as it is terrible: an undulating maelstrom of darkness and light; this is space imagined with a dizzying immensity.Nolan grounds his epic tale through the relationship between humans. There is a scene in the movie that shifts from deep space back to Earth, from a father (McConaughey) who hasn't aged much physically to a daughter(Chastain) all grown up. The difference captured in this moment was everything Cooper feared about leaving his heartland farm, son and daughter, for a last-gasp mission to find an inhabitable planet for Earth's population.Thankfully, Nolan's helped no end by his lead, the charismatic McConaughey cementing his A-list comeback with a powerful performance that helps ground the grand proceedings and provides the film with its emotional core. Among all the space phenomena and alien terrains, it's his quieter moments that provides the film's small-scale highlights. It's also his back-and-forth banter with TARS – a former military droid with a fiercely caustic artificial intelligence (voiced by comedian Bill Irwin) – that lends the film some much needed humor amidst the solemnity of the mission at hand. Meanwhile, Nolan newbie, Chastain, and regular collaborator, Caine, provide solid Earthbound support with only fairly limited screen- time, and Hathaway adds a refreshingly down-to-earth presence to the outer-space adventure.For Nolan faithfuls, all his signature notes are also present: Michael Caine imparts wisdom in front of a blackboard, the story skips through time without a fade to black, Hans Zimmer provides a haunting score, and multiple action sequences are cut together in a frenetic crescendo. If there's one area that Nolan is visibly more comfortable with, it's tense, super-sized set pieces – and he more than delivers here. From a race against a giant, skyscraper-sized wave to some frosty fisticuffs atop a herculean glacier (meticulously shot to frame the combatants as tiny ants compared to the enormity of the icy mass they're traversing), ""Interstellar"" contains its fair share of heart-in-mouth moments.The production design is more ""Alien"" than ""Star Trek"", with a grimy, functional spacecraft reaching murky, yet beautifully conceived new worlds. New cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytemer, more than ably replaces Nolan's regular DOP, Wally Pfister. The plot may be higher-than-high concept, but Nolan keeps the world of ""Interstellar"" admirably and charmingly low-key. Location shoots in Iceland lend a stunning natural edge to the film's alien landscapes, while the film's tech – taking cues from films like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Alien"" – has a tangible, old-school quality to it, from the embryonic, sous-vide-style hyper-sleep chambers to McConaughey's clunky, faceless robot sidekick TARS. Even in the depths of new galaxies, characters still write out their trajectories on white boards and explain scientific theories using pen and paper. Ditto the movie itself, shot on film in good old- fashioned 2D. It's to Nolan and his visual effects team's credit, though, that he's still able to push boundaries despite this traditional approach: ""Interstellar"" contains without doubt some of the most inventive, immersive, and abstract outer-space visuals ever put up on the big screen.""Interstellar"" poses all the right questions and provides some highly cerebral answers to most of them, while leaving the others rightfully unanswered. This is Nolan at his highest-functioning but also his least accessible; a film that eschews conflict for exploration, action for meditation and reflection. For the first time, Nolan opens his heart as well as his mind. Never hitherto a comfortably emotional filmmaker, here he demonstrates a depth of feeling not present in his earlier work. ""Interstellar"" is a wish to re-instill the wonder of the heavens in a generation for whom the only space is cyber. Anchored in the bottomless depths of paternal love, it's a story about feeling as much as thinking.As a light-year-spanning quest to save the human race, this is the director's broadest canvas by far, but also his most intimate. And against the alien backdrop of black holes, wormholes, and strange new worlds, ""Interstellar"" stands as Nolan's most human film to date.","

"foxtrot-21","9 November 2014","This year is not very good for the sci-fi cinematography. Besides multiple unintentional parodies of the genre (like X-Men: Days of Future Past), there was actually only one big-budget movie worth watching: On the Edge of Tomorrow. It seems like Tom Cruise is one of the few Hollywood stars able to wisely pick roles. His recent achievements leave little to desire: Valkyrie, or Knight and Day are good at worst, with the high pitch of Oblivion. Are we able to say the same about Matthew McConaughey? Unfortunately, not. Although his recent movies are above average (True Detective or Dallas Buyers Club), the latest picture he plays in, Interstellar (directed by Christopher Nolan and written by him and his brother), is a huge letdown and misunderstanding. I don't think anyone being fond of ""hard"" science-fiction stories will like it. Here is why.Firstly, the story. It is in general similar to Mission to Mars or The Red Planet, where the handful of daredevils are put in the spaceship to venture on a mission, which result will impact the whole human race. Unfortunately, which is the usual problem in this case, the whole plot is neither engaging, nor entertaining. We have a bunch of uninteresting people making uninteresting things in space. Maybe because of the long time span of the picture, the viewer quickly gets bored and does not care about the main characters. Besides, the space adventure is mixed with the very personal story of the father trying to save his children (which is also a time-consuming thread here). Anyway, the main conclusion of Interstellar is the banal statement that ""love is the most important thing in the world"". Do we really need to sit for almost three hours in the cinema to get this? By coincidence, the second problem is the length of the movie. Currently, when the the picture is recorded not on the tape, but in the digital medium, every director tries to surpass his rivals by creating as long movie as possible. Maybe it is supposed to be the emblem of his might, skills or wisdom? I have no idea, but the fact is that the contemporary blockbusters are difficult to watch especially because they last for three or more hours, having the plot for only half of this time. This is exactly the case with Interstellar. The presented story is far from complex, and could easily fit in two hours. In fact, the first forty minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the rest of the story and could be recapitulated by the narrator in two sentences...This film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously. Unfortunately, some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy, while others are just stupid. This mixture makes the suspension of disbelief, necessary to enjoy such movie, impossible to attain. On one side we have wormholes, black holes, higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void. On the other hand, there is totally unconvincing reality of the XXI century, where farmers are more valuable than engineers (guys, really?) and tomography is (mysteriously) gone. In one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole (by the way, this scene is IDENTICAL to the one from the far better Event Horizon). In another, we see the mission robot TARS, being the member of the crew. I know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today (like the one from The Day The Earth Stood Still), but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in Interstellar. It is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture! It's almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of Alien 3...The number of errors and non-logical events is just amazing. Anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in Prometheus (which was also much better than this one) will have the real hunting ground here. In fact, the more time passes after seeing the movie, the more nonsenses are detected. Don't think about this too much, anyway, its not worthy...The Nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story, where the word ""magic"" (interchangeable with ""nonsense"") comes to mind. As the result, the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters... Please recall the infamous Black Hole, and You will have the impression of what is going on here...The music is of course the extremely important part of every picture. If the composer knows his craft, the soundtrack complements the images, creating the flawless combo (as was in Terminator, Starship Troopers, Aliens, etc.). Here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere, but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting, therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise, making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him.Unfortunately, it seems like making a good movie about the interstellar travel is extremely difficult. People like to go to the movies and see a good story. There are multiple requirements for the entertaining movie: the mystery, the convincing scenery, the real characters we could care about, finally, the emotional strain, often related to the dangers our protagonists are exposed to. Interstellar does not offer anything of these. It is a long and boring sermon about the future of Mankind in the universe, pretending to be the science-fiction movie. With this picture Christopher Nolan proved his only memorable work was Prestige and the Batman trilogy was not the accident, but the clear sign that his main achievements in Hollywood will be too long, boring and utterly disappointing pictures, initially rising hopes for a good time spent in the cinema, but leaving in a complete, sad disillusion after all.","

"jaskunwar993","7 November 2014","It's exceedingly rare for a film to make me forget it's a film - but Interstellar managed to knock me out of my senses in a way I had never imagined. Here's the thing about films like Interstellar: the experience of these films starts way before their release, and lingers on in your bodies as a wonderful sensation way after they are over. Christopher Nolan, god bless that genius, announced Interstellar a week after the release of TDKR, and since then, we his fans have driven ourselves mad trying to figure out what Nolan would do with Black Holes and Time Travel and such alike - and what he does is not only brilliant, but beautiful in unthinkable ways.I really need a second viewing to fully be able to appreciate the technical elements of the film, because after a point, really, I was too immersed in the whole experience of it to bother paying attention. But the cinematography, editing, visual effects, set design, the score (Oh, Hans Zimmer!), Nolan's direction, the performances, all combined into a powerful 3 hours that transports you to another universe for the whole time. They did their jobs perfectly so honestly I wouldn't be able to find a flaw. Some have criticized the sound design but I disagree: it was all just so beautiful. So perfect. Nolan raises so many questions in our minds and answers them so beautifully as time goes. I loved this. I absolutely loved this and I implore you to go and watch it and experience and understand what cinema is really, really about.For those who have not seen it, please do not read on. Just go watch it.A solid 12/10 - because yes, it dares to go beyond.***SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT***Let me shrug off the criticism against it: the emotional quotient - 'Love'. ""Love is the one thing that transcends time and space."" It's been said by many that the emotional quotient of this film takes away from the 'other' parts of it, however, the 'many' may not have fully understood what Nolan was trying to say. Think of love as a physical being - an actual something that literally 'transcends' time and space - think of love itself as the fifth dimension beyond time! This whole wonderful journey is the process of understanding this truth, told through the stranded relationship of a daughter and father. Being a student of philosophy myself, this whole concept visualized with scientific rationality is a kind of dream-come-true for me. It is not a film for the pleasure of viewing the film - it raises and answers in its own logic the questions that humankind is yet to find answers to in real life. This film is a realization in the purest sense - this film goes beyond itself, beyond the concept of being just a film. Nolan does the unthinkable: in the never-ending debate between religion and science about the ultimate source of energy for the world, Nolan finds a middle ground.This film is Revelation. Wow. Just wow.","

"jakebunker","10 December 2021","Oh my goodness! What an incredible film! I am a pretty big fan of Nolan's works; this is probably my favorite one (yes, better than Inception and Dark Knight). I enjoyed just about everything in this movie: the characters, the plot, the filming, the intensity, the emotion, the score and the visuals were all absolutely stellar. They were all very spectacularly made. It was just a movie that I could just sit back relax and watch and not search for every incorrect miniscule detail. Now it probably isn't the most interesting thing for kids, and the ending makes a perfect storyline go a little wonky. A small understanding of space time goes a long way into understanding this movie so I get where some people are coming from. But seriously please go watch this movie it is definitely one of the best ever made.","

"twominds79","12 March 2019","I find it hard to articulate how powerful this film is and how it effects me. Chris Nolan has set the bar higher than he did on 'Inception'. The story is based on probable science , with help from Kip Thorne. The cast is perfect. Matthew McConaughy as the former pilot and everyman' who is battling a desire to do what he is destined to do . Fly an outerspace mission or stay on a dying world and looking after his kids. Nolan regular Michael Caine , Jessica Chastain , Timothee Chalamet and Anne Hathaway round out the main cast. The surprise packet is young Mackenzie Foy who's daughter /father relationship drives the emotional side of the film. The robot TARS was my favourite character in the film. He was the humour and he shows human quality when all seems lost.
Hans Zimmer's score maybe the best he's EVER done! Pulsating and driving and plays on the heart strings like no other score I can remember.
Through the nearly 3 hours I was on the edge of my seat following the crews every move and all the while following the seemingly doomed mankind on earth. It's hard to go into specific parts of the film without spoilers.
I laughed , Cried and cheered with jubilation throughout. An instant 10/10 that gets better on viewing. I can't stress how much I recommend this film. Drop what you're doing!!","

"soupster1","21 January 2015","It starts off with a farmer (Independence Day style), and then we are quickly transported into a world where the planet is doomed because... well... we're not really sure why, but it involves a lot of wind.Then NASA gets involved and our heroes get sent into a kind of 'space' that comes complete with bad paintings of old 'hubble' pictures, lots of 'space' type language... and gravity. The gravity is ever present. Nothing ever floats about, and they get 'skipped' off the orbit around Mars before whizzing past Saturn (it has rings) and arriving at a black hole. They get through the black hole (like that's possible), by looking slightly concerned and talking like cowboys.The robots look and act like corn flake boxes, the humans (mostly well known), look bemused... and at that point... I had to stop watching. I was hoping it was all going to turn out to be a joke... but it wasn't.I don't like ranting, so I won't.

"blufrog49","7 November 2014","First, I did NOT see this in IMAX.If the director's goal was to make us (me, at least) feel ignorant because all the mumbo-jumbo is over our heads, he succeeded. Visually, it's pretty good, but not nearly as good as last year's ""Gravity"" and tries to duplicate the emotions of that movie, unsuccessfully.The movie is way too long and overwrought. The acting is good, but the storyline is so convoluted that you don't really care about most of the characters.And of course (SPOILER!), the Black guy has to die.This might be worth seeing in an IMAX theater, if your ticket is discounted--otherwise wait for Netflix.","

"krzysiektom","11 November 2014","I give it a 5 only because it is an overly sentimental at times, ludicrous in its storyline, bloated sci-fi attempt at landing the Nolans some Oscars. A manipulative almost-dross. Chris Nolan is simply too ambitious for his own good. The comparisons with Kubrick's 2001: Space Odyssey are demeaning to Kubrick, they are not in the same league as film directors. Kubrick pandered to the intellect and treated viewers with respect, Nolan panders to the American Film Academy and the box office, and treats viewers with disrespect. Kubrick was a film artist, Nolan is a film craftsman and a businessman, nothing more. Interstellar contains too much talking, too much exposition. One astronaut explains to another the basics of how black holes work, like to a little child and just moments before they are to enter one? Pleeease. And what's with this father-daughter love and bond, crazy and all? The crying and weeping, she breaks into a crying fit more than 20 years later (kid you not) at the thought that daddy might have deceived her?? The underlining thesis of the film is that ""love is the only thing (a ""thing""??) which overcomes time and space"". Corny and retarded, and so very Hollywood. Emotional and family-oriented string-pulling is at the core of Hollywood filmmaking business, that's what makes them mega bucks, so they go on manipulating. Chris Nolan is either emotionally infantile or a manipulative hack, a film artist he is not. Basically the only element in the film that I liked very much was the music score, I found it very pleasing and strangely not overbearing, though there is a lot of it in almost every scene. Even the much-praised special effects and shots of the cosmos do not impress, for me there is not a single scene that gives a feeling of enormous vastness of space and how the Earth is but a tiny, little speck like a grain of sand on an ocean beach. I guess the film will be nominated at least for special effects and musical score, but it is far from a masterpiece.","

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","27 December 2014","Interstellar was an absolutely breathtaking experience for me. I thought the writing, the direction, the score and especially the acting (Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy both gave equally phenomenal performances) were all top notch. The film had the feeling of space films from the past, like 2001: A Space Odyssey (as many have said before), but I thought it also had elements of other space adventures, namely Apollo 13 and Planet of the Apes (the original 1968 film).Another thing that truly resonated with me was Hans Zimmer's gorgeous film score, that I swear he took (musical) notes on what made John Williams film music so moving, and he gave an equally immersive soundtrack to the film that adds another emotional dimension to Christopher Nolan's latest blockbuster epic. Never was the music out of place; it always fit in perfectly with what was going on. It can be its own thing from the film, and it truly tells its own story through sound, something that not many movies have accomplished in quite sometime.The space scenes in particular, have music played to that shows it very much is, and feels like this great expanse of the unknown, an infinite vacuum of an ocean that is full of many beauties and terrors. Hans Zimmer basically added to the already sweeping story of space and time, with an equally overwhelming score that I did not expect to be impacted by it in such a way.Christopher Nolan takes the audience to where they've never truly gone to before until now, through wormholes and the time distortion that black holes can make to nearby planets. It is a big yet beautifully done self-contained adventure. It is not only a fully fledged space epic, but also a cautionary environmental warning for what will happen if we don't leave the Earth when it is a desolate, dust-coated wasteland.I don't know for sure if Interstellar will get the Oscar glory like some were predicting before, but either way, I'm happy that I saw such an ambitious film that has left an impact on quite a lot of people already. It would be nice if it got a Best Picture, Best Actor or Best Screenplay nomination but I don't know for sure; however its music, cinematography and special effects will surely get rightful Academy Awards recognition in 2015.If you want a true space opera that encompasses the wonders of the galaxy, time travel and completely believable characters that need to save humanity, Interstellar is the film for you.Thank you Christopher Nolan. You are such a wonderfully talented filmmaker. Interstellar was such a wonderful gift.P.S. See the film in IMAX 70mm whenever you can, or at the usual cineplex; just see it when you can, folks!","

"atlasmb","17 December 2014","Great music. An extremely talented cast. Amazing special effects. Captivating issues to contemplate. So why do I think I will not ponder this film long after I have viewed it? The story is convoluted, though interesting. All the drama and mystery and intrigue leads to a finale that tells us what? Well, not really much. But it's a fun trip getting there.I liked many of the characters. And I was invested in their problems and tragedies. But the final ""explanation"" of the film's phenomena has a ""Sixth Sense"" feeling to it. I say see this film for its good points, but don't expect the groundbreaking impact of Kubrick's ""2001"" or the atmospherics of ""Blade Runner"" or the thrilling ride of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".","

"pontificator","11 November 2014","reading the other reviews here its hard to conceive that I watched the same movie everyone is gushing about. the central premise is hardly noble although perhaps quite the likely selfish outcome i.e. after trashing this planet lets go trash some others. the black hole visualizations were quite lame. this is not a great sci-fi film even remotely in the league of 2001 although a cursory superficial viewing might suggest so to an unthinking non-sci-fi buff. a great scifi film would naturally start by 1st adapting a great scifi story. these are yet to be made such as ringworld, dyson spheres and fleet of worlds concepts. to think that all these mind boggling stories exist yet this rather old and tired story concept is chosen to lavish money on is strange, although it is somewhat understandable as the afore-mentioned stories would be much greater challenges all around and so its best that they are ignored rather than poorly realized as this primarily propaganda piece.","

"The_Film_Cricket","11 November 2014","If we learned anything last year from Gravity it is that when dealing with movies based on science fact, less is more. Christopher Nolan might have taken some of that to heart with his new space adventure Interstellar. Here is a movie with infinite science and infinite filmmaking skill, but it weighs so heavily on an over-melodramatic bid for the soul of humanity that after three hours we find ourselves too exhausted to care.The story, at its core, is a good one. We're sometime in the near-future when the planet Earth is essentially on life-support (Al Gore will love this movie), suffering a resurgence of the dustbowl as our crops are drying up and humanity has regressed into an agrarian state. Amid this breakdown we meet Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a good-hearted former aeronautical engineer-turned-farmer who is raising a son named Tom, and a daughter named Murphy (if you forget that name, rest assured that Cooper will repeat it at least 300 times before the movie is over).During a massive dust storm, Cooper and Murphy find themselves the recipients of a sign in binary that is either a message from ghosts, God or space aliens. In doing the math, Cooper finds himself among officials at the remains of NASA, and quickly assigned to travel into space, navigate through a worm hole and find another habitable planet to sustain mankind. His crew includes a mournful co-pilot named Brand (Anne Hathaway), a physicist named Romilly (David Dyasi); and a geographer named Doyle (Wes Bentley). Also, two robots named CASE and TARS, who look like monoliths and move like spiders. Actually CASE and TARS are the best things in the movie. They look like the kiosk that you buy your movie tickets from, but they break into smaller parts to perform rudimentary functions –they're really quite impressive.Through a plot that gets way too complicated, the crew find themselves on the other side of the galaxy where they realize that one hour on the new planet equals seven years on Earth. That leads to emotional crises on Cooper's part because he's the one member of the crew with kids back home. Time and relative space begin to spin and bend and twist until neither the crew nor the audience can figure what the heck is going on. This is a very complex story, one that I admit I struggled to follow (and I was able to follow Inception).You find yourself having to look amid large chunks of story to find the main narrative. When you get there you find that through all the gargantuan special effects, music and sound effects, Intersteller is really the story of the disconnection between Cooper and Murphy. Cooper knows that when he gets back home that his daughter will be all grown up (and played by Jessica Chastain) so his mission is really just an effort to make things right. That leads to a long, VERY long scenes in which Cooper mourns the fact that he'll never get to watch his little girl grow up. That would be fine except that the movie belabors the point for nearly three hours, playing the same overemotional notes over and over. Not to be heartless, but when traveling to the other side of the universe, I really could care less about a weepy little girl back home.Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite filmmakers. He is the one director working right now who really wants to put his vision on screen rather than pander to popular taste. We've seen in Inception , and the Batman pictures that he knows how to tell a grand story using logic and good screen writing. He has a grand vision for what he wants to put on screen, but in Intersteller he goes over the edge. His overbearing emotional output becomes too much for the audience to carry.","

"sanjay219","4 November 2014","Just watched Interstellar in imax 70mm. Science Fiction fans can read on, everyone else can skip. Movie is a visual masterpiece. Like his earlier movies, Christopher Nolan once again proved, how big a movie can be! There were some shots,which made audience go crazy..Some scenes were as epic as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Do not go into the theatre expecting an action packed cerebral thriller. This one is not for action fans. At times, movie go highly sentimental( Matthew McConaughey does what he is best in and supposed to). I recommend this movie to all the Sci-Fi fans out there, make sure you go in group of sci-fi nuts!! Do not go with the hype..Go, sit back and enjoy. Just like Inception, this movie will be known as great after few months(I know people who said Inception was a crap when it released, and after few months rating it 10/10 in IMDb :D). I don't wanna spoil anything(If you want PM me). Also, make sure you go to the best theatre close to you. (If you loved Donnie Darko, 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is the one for you, Get ready to get mind blown!!) Interstellar Movie is EPIC in all sense!!","

And here in 2014 IMDb is giving Interstellar an 8.6 rating . I found this latest film over the top unbelievable! And incredibly silly. The top cast did give a good performance, but felt the acting of both Michael Cain and Matt Dillon not worthy of this script. The entire third act was choreographed wonderfully but again unbelievable and extremely hard to follow.168 minutes was also much too long ., could have been edited to 2 hours . I do give creedance to Christopher Nolan his eye to detail, and didn't include audio to outside space travel, just as Stanley Kubrick did for his Space Opera 50 years before, but the overall audience didn't buy that film eithe.Sorry. I give a 6 rating .","

"secondtake","13 November 2014","Interstallar (2014)This is a Christopher Nolan movie. So when it does what he does best—shake you out of your seat with cinematic brilliance—it's terrific. I mean terrific. There are effects, like the black hole, or the various spacecraft maneuvers, and even a few wild dashes through cornfields, that work so well you don't need to think about why they are happening. You are immersed, and impressed, and wowed.But Nolan is more clever than deep it seems. A movie like ""Memento"" takes the slimmest of terrific ideas (a reordering of time in the brain) and make it amazing to watch. Movies like his Batman trilogy avoid even cleverness and work with pure energy and mythology. But in all of these there is no sense of what you would call ""meaning."" They are entertainments. ""Interstellar"" is purely horrible science—it's the butt of endless jokes on the web. But behind all the liberties and mistakes there, the movie is trying to say something ""deep"" about being human in an inhuman universe. About the special qualities humans have to be innovative, to procreate, and most of all to love. This is a bowing down to the power of love. Love conquers all, that kind of thing.Maybe it's the brother, Jonathan Nolan, who is responsible here as the co-writer. The grandiose ideas the two of them present in ""Batman Rises"" are wonderfully impossible and almost laughable if you take them out of context. (In context they're part of the whole great success of the movie.) But ""Interstallar"" takes itself seriously. Way too seriously for this kind of material and with no grip on the science, not even a hint of it. As a fantasy, it could have gone so much farther, as a piece of art based on reality, well, go see ""Gravity"" for an alternative that makes a better (imperfect) attempt to follow the rules of nature.There is of course the plot here, saving the world, saving the species, saving your family. You have to just go with the flow here, as well, since it's all a bit romanticized in a Spielberg/Cameron kind of plasticky gloss. It frankly made me sick—and yet it was so well filmed I liked it. That's the kicker—Nolan is terrific with the camera, and with the vision of making things vivid and big.See this movie for all of those best things. I saw it on a celluloid (non-digital) IMAX screen and in those portions of the movie shot in full 70mm large format, the effects were memorable. (The movie alternates between standard widescreen 35mm film and full, academy ratio 70mm, which is taller and has far more detail. The normal theater presentations approximate the effects, but in a more normal scale and resolution.) Obviously this movie has won a lot of people over. I'm not sure who they are, but it's reasonable to be blown away. Nolan has openly defended himself against all the complaints—as if everyone is wrong and we just don't get it. Fine. If you want a hilarious rundown of some of the many logical problems of the movie, see http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/11/08/interstellar-plot-holes/ or type interstallar plot holes entertainment weekly in google.But what until you see it first and just enjoy it on its own terms.","

"alexanderbahchevanov1","7 November 2014","As a sci-fi fan, who loves 2001 SO, Contact, Gravity and many other movies that deal with with the topics also covered in Interstellar, I have to say, I have no words to describe the movie. It just took me for one hell of a ride! The score provided by Hans Zimmer was an extraordinary piece of work. It fits the movie so well that it was like the movie was made to fit the OST and not the other way around. There is an interview with Christopher Nolan, in which he states that he wouldn't allow Hans Zimmer to know exactly what the movie's plot device is, he only told to him that he has to focus on the connection between father and daughter. If this is the truth - WOW! it worked flawlessly!I won't go and describe what I saw on the big screen because this is something that anyone that goes to see the movie has to experience for himself... I can only tell you that after I saw the credits, I attempted to get off my seat, it didn't worked. I tried again, pushing harder - it barely worked. Moments after I was at the theater's exit heading out for the bus. I saw it coming just right on time with me, but I didn't get on. I was compelled to walk and think. Think of what I saw... My head was aching, my ears too and my eyes were closing only to call back images from the movie. I got home and found myself undressed and dressed with my casual home clothes. Then I realized that I have also walked the 7 kilometers road to my home without noticing... I was still in the movie, I must definitely been, because only there the time behaved the way I was feeling while coming home...","

"bheadher","9 June 2017","Interstellar has some good points, and some very bad points entertainment wise...First of all, the movie is extremely boring...which may tickle some people I suppose. Literally the first half of the movie is some sort of family affair for the stars, with shots of their flying a drone, and experiencing a huge dust storm at their big farm...only to have McGaunahey and his daughter go off searching for some ultra secret space base out in the boonies, where they find out there is a plan to go through a wormhole to somewhere else...Then we have a crazy robot that is a clone for the mystery obelisk in 2001. This robot never does anything much,except wiggle its segments and occasionally respond to voice...Then the trip into space, on a Saturn 5 rebuild, that links up to a spacecraft fixture in space, which promptly begins revolving to produce pseudo-gravity...A boring flight out to Saturn, through the wormy hole, and we arrive at somewhere else, supposedly a planet...land ""in"" the water, get thrashed by a tsunami, and here we are...still no solid plot at all...I remember watching the movie Contact, which was boring in it's own way, but this one is ten times worse...only one step above awful...","

"eddie_baggins","9 November 2014","A cinematic experience of the highest order, I imagine Interstellar will be many different things to many different people, a movie that will inspire thought, flame imagination and push filmmaking in a varied myriad of new and exciting directions, yet it will also be a film that divides the masses, as we've seen already with critics. While many will herald the vision and scope of Christopher Nolan's most ambitious film yet, there will be equal amounts that find fault in its lofty goals, pick holes in its unashamedly mawkish sentiments and then there's those that think Matthew McConaughey might mumble just a little too much. Taking a very personal approach to a movie I feel deeply awe struck by, I will be one of those many people that completely and faithfully stick by a film that for years to come will be a new benchmark in not only the Sci-Fi genre but movie making as a whole.Naming Interstellar as my most anticipated movie of the year was based on Christopher Nolan's impeccable track record at crafting lofty and masterfully made movies. Over a period of nearly two decades now, the British auteur has oft delved into the human condition, whether it be our memories, our dreams or our dark knights, Nolan has never not reached for the stars and never more so literally than in his most affecting tale here. That critics have found flaws and faults in this journey bemuses me greatly and in saying journey I truly believe this is as close as we could ever come as an audience to such an expedition (not since the Lord of the Rings trilogy had I felt so immersed in a world, in a trek). Critical backlashes to Interstellar bemuses me so as finding flaws here makes me wonder where these critics were for Nolan's previous productions. From Following right through to his most flawed yet thoroughly enjoyable Inception, Nolan's films have always been far from foolproof experiences yet nit-picking them would be taking away from the abundance of cinematic genius that lays so openly before us. Interstellar without question is riddled with moments and with scenarios that are very far from perfect yet what encompasses them is something one can only but marvel at.Displaying a directional tone and an emotional depth that sees a maturity to an already mature behind his years filmmaker, Interstellar sees Nolan open up new dimensions both literally and in a directional sense and there is a heart here I've never seen from Nolan, an emotional core that beats so strongly even as we venture deeper and deeper into the unknown with McConaughey's Cooper and his crew of mankind's saviours. There are ideas here that not only click your mind into overdrive but a beating pulse that drives this adventure into the affecting material it becomes. This is Nolan at his finest and we to see yet another stunning turn from the born again McConaughey with a scene where Cooper watches videos now years old of his family particularly showcasing the power of McConaughey as an actor and he is without question the rock that allows Interstellar to be built upon. There are also visuals to wow the mind here, fantastic cinematography work by new Nolan DOP Hoyte Van Hoytema and a score by Hans Zimmer that must surely be one of the most finely crafted film musical accompaniments of the modern movie era and there is a general sense of overall excellence to a production that clearly wanted to do justice to its masters grand visions.Once more on a personnel note, I was starting to question the power of modern day movies to engage in an entertainment sense, an emotional sense and in a thought provoking manner but Interstellar has wholeheartedly showcased to me once more the power the medium holds when produced in such a splendid manner. Sure Anne Hathaway can be annoying, yes no doubt some of the dialogue may clunk and do we really need our movies 100% scientifically accurate? There criticisms of the film are valid to a point; there also criticisms of a film that also do not in many way shape or form matter. Put your prejudices aside, allow yourself to be carried away on the Endurance and Nolan's cinematic treat will take you on a movie trip unlike any other (even when paying homage to Sci-Fi greats that have preceded it). A startling example of the power off big budget movie making and wonderful vision come to life, Interstellar is not only the big screen movie of the year but an all-time classic that I for one can guarantee will be talked about and studied on for years to come by a raft of not only movie lovers, but movie makers, inspired to reach for the unknown just like Nolan did here.5 A-listers in cryogenic sleep out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com","

"krahl-81949","25 November 2015","I'm a big fan of anything Sci-Fi and I've always been interested in the boundaries that directors push when it comes to imagining the impossible and predicting or presenting the future on screen. While most science fiction films step over into the fantastical and often prioritize the ""Fi"" over the ""Sci"", Interstellar is one of those rare gems that balances the two elements and also delivers a spectacularly entertaining movie.Any doubts I had going into the film about a dramatic SciFi being directed by Christopher Nolan were instantly muted as soon as the movie and its tremendous score began. While Nolan excelled with The Prestige and Inception, they did leave something to be desired and I was fresh off the Batman trilogy bandwagon. But Nolan excels yet again, directing the film with such confidence and control that it's almost impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen. Each and every aspect of his signature style is also prominently visible through the film.Continue reading the review at my blog below:https://microreels.wordpress.com/2015/11/25/interstellar-film- review/","

"liana-moisescu","9 November 2014","I just returned after seeing ""Interstellar"" again (2nd time) and I can say that my second experience was even more powerful than the first. I'm trying to find the right words to express the thrilling journey that is this film. First I'd like to advice you to try and pay attention to every single line - nothing is said without purpose and everything is somehow connected. It slowly builds up with the beginning to this phenomenal emotional ride and it will not let go until the very end. It will keep you on the edge of your sit - literally -, it will make you cry, it will make you jump, it will completely absorb you. Throughout the course of it I forgot I was in a cinema. I was living every single moment with the characters, feeling what they're feeling. At times, I found myself staring blankly trying to comprehend its complexity - How can this be? Is this really happening? Can it be so epic? The second time I saw it I understood the importance of every single scene and line, I saw more connection, more intricacy and (even) more genius in it. The first time it was grand and overwhelming, it just hit me hard and I couldn't really pay attention to details. The emotional journey part was very important to me; but of course, there are the stunning visuals which contribute immensely and transcend you there, into the action. They were fantastic, superb, simply put, film-making at its finest.This is all, of course, from my point of view - a super sci-fi, fantasy, adventure and all associated genres enthusiast. Although I cannot imagine how one, regardless of their movie preferences, can dislike ""Interstellar"" - it's that good.What I'm obviously saying is GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Expect epicness. It will not disappoint.","

"Likes_Ninjas90","4 November 2014","Amidst the stars in the galaxy known as Hollywood a deep mystery remains: who is Christopher Nolan as a filmmaker? After seeing Interstellar in IMAX, his ninth and least satisfying film, the question perpetuates. Nolan is one of the most powerful and bankable directors in the world. Together, his last four films earned nearly four billion dollars. Money builds opportunities and egos in Hollywood and consequently each entry in Nolan's filmography has grown in size and scope. Yet outside of his admiration for 35 mm film and practical effects, grasping Nolan's auteurist imprint is difficult. He says he wants to make the biggest film possible but so does Michael Bay. Nolan's films walk a difficult line, balancing large ideas and explosions, proving blockbusters don't have to be mindless. But these are studio films, without insight into the filmmaker himself like transparent ideological goals. In interviews, Nolan mirrors this impersonal nature. He is softly spoken, measured and serious, concurrent with the thematic goals of his films like the hidden identities of men. In 2010 The Guardian asked if Nolan is the new Stanley Kubrick, a misguided comparison with superficial parallels. Kubrick distanced himself from Hollywood by owning his own cameras and editing equipment. He also relied on the specificity of images to create meaning rather than dialogue, making his films cinematic in form, not merely scope. Stylistically Terrence Malick (The Tree of Life) is a more appropriate companion to Kubrick. Artistically, Nolan shares more in common with Steven Spielberg as both directors inject ideas into the existing framework of sizable studio films. Spielberg was originally hired to direct Interstellar with Nolan's brother Jonathan writing the script from an idea by physicist Kip Thorne. Christopher Nolan replaced Spielberg and helped rewrite his brother's script. The first hour of Jonathan's original script was set on Earth and retained but his brother's decision to refine the space elements has drawn comparisons to Kubrick's flawed masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey and Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind.To this point, I have enjoyed many of Nolan's films but Interstellar's script is terribly inconsistent. Using a mostly narrow, linear structure, the narrative hurls ideas at us about climate change, parenting, space exploration, time travel and alternate dimensions, but the script lacks refinement. The Nolans talk over us, not to us. In a self-conscious move to intellectualise a ""save the world"" story, they substitute detailed characterisation and backstory in favour of impenetrable scientific discussions about relativity and gravity. An embarrassingly rich cast is left to substantiate these thinly realised characters. Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, is a former pilot who is now a widowed farmer with two young children, including a girl named Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and an ageing father-in-law (John Lithgow). Cooper, not dissimilar to Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters, is an archetype of the reckless parent who is sentimentally motivated by his children and largely only interesting because of McConaughey's predictable charisma. Earth is doomed because of dust storm and droughts, a nod to The Grapes of Wrath, leading Cooper to be tasked by Professor Brand (Michael Caine) with travelling into space and investigating three potentially inhabitable planets. Another major character is Brand's astronaut daughter Amelia (surely named after Amelia Earhart), played by Anne Hathaway. Her reliable expressiveness instills some surface emotions to an otherwise stony character, with no backstory or arc. Other actors are either underused or have distracting cameos. An actress the quality of Jessica Chastain deserved a bigger part but only features deep into the story in a forgettable role as the adult Murph.This time the self-seriousness which gave the Batman films a unique stylistic tone is Nolan's Achilles' heel. While desperate for the story to emotionally resonate, resorting to extended close-ups of Cooper crying for leaving his children behind, he remains unaware of the story's absurdity. It is an insurmountable task when the dialogue is dry, textbook theory and the plotting becomes increasingly ridiculous, attempting to marry between the spaces of a bookcase shelf the pretensions of alternate dimensions with a family melodrama. There are also episodes where the stock characters fail to move us. During the exploration of the first planet a side character is killed, which expectedly strikes a chord with Cooper and Amelia, but matters little to us when we've barely come to know the character's name. Other singular moments remind us of how skillful Nolan is with set pieces. The first entry into outer space is intensely realised, with the galaxy being simultaneously beautiful and dangerous. The infrequency of these emotions stresses how undisciplined the narrative is, particularly in an incoherent, final hour, which doesn't utilise the multilayered structure of The Dark Knight Rises or strike Inception's emotional high notes.Watching the film in the IMAX format is as inconsistent as the narrative. Hoyte van Hoytema, the usually reliable Dutch-Swedish photographer who shot Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Her and Let the Right One In with great symmetry, has replaced Nolan's regular photographer Wally Pfister. Surprisingly, the early scenes on Cooper's farmhouse are poorly lit and the images are muddy and graining, a deliberate imitation of the sandstorms, but an ugly choice all the same. Other shots use the full volume of the IMAX screen and the scale is impressive. Some of the galactic images are awe-inspiring and vivid but their scarcity coupled with the tight, obstructed camera-work inside the spacecraft, is disappointing. Uncharacteristically, Nolan's pacing is also laborious, dragging the film to his longest running time of nearly three hours. The film isn't as calculated as 2001, a difficult feat for any director, but pales substantially to last year's terrific Alfonso Cuaron film Gravity, which eclipses Interstellar for precision. It was made for sixty-five million dollars less. It is half the length and aside from being a technically superior film, it understands the futility of a large canvas unless our emotional investment is supported by strong characters.","

"anaconda-40658","25 December 2015","Interstellar (2014): Dir: Christopher Nolan / Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, Michael Caine: The future looks grim with sand storms destroying everything and corn pretty much the only thing growing. As with Inception, Christopher Nolan toys with the theme of time. This time a farmer and pilot, played by Matthew McConaughey leaves his young son and daughter with their grandfather and then leads an expedition to space through a worm hole. This is in hopes of finding planets to colonize on. Unfortunately complication arise when McConaughey discovers that his son and daughter are now grown adults in the span of a few hours that he was on the first planet, surfaced mainly of water. Watching someone be subdued with grieving regret while his children rapidly grow old is very depressing. It lends the idea of valuing time spent with loved ones. McConaughey is caught in such a dilemma and hopes that his daughter is bright enough to figure it all out. Anne Hathaway plays the daughter of the scientist heading the research, and who joins McConaughey on the mission. Jessica Chastain plays the now grown daughter, stubborn, determined, and clever to boot. Matt Damon plays an astronaut revived from hyper sleep on an ice planet with a secret mission of his own. Michael Caine plays the scientist heading the research that might outlive him. This is hardly an uplifting experience but it contains Nolan's signature curiosity of time. Glorious special effects are out of this world creating what science only dreams of. Score: 8 / 10","

"MikesIDhasbeentaken","5 April 2015","Have to agree with others who've been surprised this garbage has got such a high score on IMDb, it's not clever, well written, nor are the special effects great (when the ships 'grab' onto each other it's like watching the grabbing machines at a funfair)It's just a load of nonsense, I'm all for weird sci-fi movies that try and offer something different, but this is silly when it's trying to be serious, and nowhere near clever enough to be pulled off.The whole thing just feels dragged out, the end explanation was just lazy, boring and ridiculous, in line with the rest of the film. with such a budget surely the visuals were going to be good... a masterpiece if you believe the hundreds of reviews... but it was just awful, everything was cringing to watch, was the robot thing meant to be taken seriously?? who wrote this stuff and got hundreds of millions to make it?Looks like the people involved with the film have a few friends tho, all writing good reviews on IMDb it seems,","

"doughelo","17 November 2014","Somewhere in Interstellar is a decent 90 minute movie padded to 3 hours. I thought it might feel long; what I didn't expect was the cheap, weepy emoting and Hallmark philosophizing.As for the padding, at least 40 minutes goes by before anyone mentions space, yet nothing of the ecological disaster is explained in any depth. No point is so trivial it can't be made ten times, no scene so long it can't be stretched beyond the breaking point. And oh, the sap – love is described as a kind of quantum effect that transcends time and space (as long as it's between parent and child).The supposed scientific accuracy was limited largely to the depiction of stellar lensing around the black hole and the silence of space. Howevvver Why do pickup trucks look exactly the same in the future? Why is the dust all over the trucks and house but not the crops? That was the most ridiculous robot I've ever seen (I love the comment that it was made of ""spinning HVAC ducts""). How does this lurching refrigerator even get itself through a hatch? Its interface is a crude text screen worthy of a PCjr, yet it has a complete human personality (so much so that I had a hard time distinguishing its voice from the crew).Do you always launch your rockets from the middle of your office buildings? Remarkable how those glass partitions in view stood up to the blast.Apparently having no idea of what a wormhole is BEFORE being sent through one, Matthew is shown the rudimentary folded paper analogy. Wouldn't that have come up on the first day of class? How does a mile-high wave form out of foot-deep water? The planet orbits a black hole? Where's your light and heat coming from? Any problem with the intense X-rays usually found around these things? Guess not.On Matt Damon's planet, exactly why aren't the ""frozen clouds"" falling? At least Avatar posited superconducting rocks and intense magnetic fields to explain their floating mountains.When Matt takes Matthew out to show him the ""surface"", just how far do they walk? The rescue pilot flies at hundreds of miles an hour for at least a few minutes.When Cooper returns to our solar system, at least 60 years has elapsed since he received his daughter's video messages (since she is now in her 90s or more), so has Anne Hathaway been alone all that time on her planet? I don't recall any mention that she was going to be in a slow time region. By the way, time only slows down significantly in a very high gravitational field, which they showed no signs of being in.Besides all that and much more, the plot was disjointed, with inarticulate dialog and confusing placement of people. For example, during the entire scene of the boosted entry towards the black hole, I didn't know Cooper was in the shuttle, separated from Anne Hathaway in the station, until he looked across at her.It's not a completely terrible movie, there are some great visuals that are impressive in IMAX. But they're dragged down with the padding and cheap sentiment.","

"Fluke_Skywalker","2 April 2015","Unlike, say, Michael Bay, Christopher Nolan always reaches for the highest rung on the ladder. It's an admirable trait, and the results certainly speak for themselves. Unfortunately with 'Interstellar' his grasp on that rung is often tenuous, and the result is a film where awesome and awful play tug of war.Technically the film is brilliant. The F/X and the cinematography are absolutely first-rate. It's too bad they're in service to a convoluted and emotionally stunted story. The cast do what they can, but there's just nothing here for them to gain purchase, and as a result I experienced a total emotional detachment throughout.","

This Sci-fi movie had everything I want and more in a movie.... action, love, intelligence, A-Class acting and space exploration. I adore every part of this film and the AI robots that follow the characters about in the film add a wonderful touch.This movie blew my mind back then and it still does now.","

"Hellmant","7 November 2014","'INTERSTELLAR': Five Stars (Out of Five)Christopher Nolan's new $165 million budgeted sci-fi epic about a team of explorers that travel across space, through a newly discovered wormhole, in an attempt to find a more habitable planet for humanity to live on; after all resources on Earth are nearly destroyed, by drought and famine. It was directed by Nolan and written by him and his brother Jonathan (the two have teamed together on many scripts for Christopher Nolan films). It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo, Wes Bentley, Casey Affleck, Topher Grace, John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn and Michael Caine (plus a few other surprise celebrity cameos, if you don't check IMDb). I think it's a breathtakingly beautiful and impressively ambitious film but it isn't quite as great as I was hoping, even so.The story begins in the near future, when mankind is desperately trying to produce more agricultural resources; due to natural disaster (like mainly huge dust storms) depleting most of what we had. A secret NASA intelligence base, lead by Professor Brand (Caine), has discovered a wormhole that can quickly lead space travelers to other uncharted planets. They hope to send a team of experts through the wormhole, in an attempt to find a planet suitable to live on and colonize (saving humanity). Brand recruits Cooper (McConaughey), a former NASA pilot, into leading the mission; when he mysteriously stumbles across their hidden base. Cooper is reluctant to leave his family behind, especially his daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy), but he knows it's the only way to possibly save them. The scientific aspects of the story are pretty complex and hard to follow (for me at least) but I think with repeat viewing I'll understand the movie a lot more (it took me at least two or three viewings to fully get 'INCEPTION'). For that reason, plus it's nearly three hour running length, it is very slow and feels really long in places. It's visually stunning and always emotionally involving and interesting (even if you can't always understand what's going on). The acting is all great, especially McConaughey (his character is by far the most developed); he, and his costars, do bring a lot more depth to the film (than just the Nolans possibly could). Like a lot of classic sci-fi it gets really philosophical in the end; attempting to explore really broad elements of love and life that science never has been able to, but that's what I especially liked about it. Nolan does an amazing job presenting the material; even if he's a lot more focused on telling a broader and more emotionally complex story this time around, rather than stunning people constantly with action and quick pacing. It's definitely memorable and one not to be missed (especially if you're a Christopher Nolan or sci-fi movie fan).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/BjKuYpFJY8M","

"g-hbe","27 May 2018","...ruined by almost indecipherable speech, especially on the part of Cooper. We chose this film as it had received good reviews and we like a good science fiction film, but within the first ten minutes we knew we were in for a 'what did he say' -fest. The actor playing Cooper had such mumbled, lazy diction and spoke in a semi whisper it was almost impossible to understand anything he said. About an hour in we almost decided to give up and watch an old 60's Doris Day & Rock Hudson comedy instead - at least you can hear every word clear as a bell. But we struggled through all 2.5 hours of it and came out the other end none the wiser.
Do they go somewhere to learn how to mangle their speech? Or maybe they have their jaws wired?","

"SangamYadagiri","18 November 2014","Interstellar is a movie worth watching only in large format theaters just for the experience. It's loosely based on the Einstein's General Theory of relativity - going into the black-hole travelling with the speed of light and navigating back and forth in time as one of the physical dimensions.Visually it is interesting to watch the theory of relativity come to reality on screen which is very impressive. It depicts the quantum physics near accurately. The fact that when an object/subject travels with the speed of light, it's original state or age is unaltered/slowed down - is shown convincingly. Apart from the science, the movie strongly revolves around the different Relationships among human beings especially the father daughter one. Matthew McConaughey's acting is very convincing in every scene.Graphics is something that is worth mentioning here. A new technique that has apparently been used in this movie. Normally the green screens have been used to shot the dramatic/action scenes with actors and the computer graphics were created later and then were super imposed. Even thought this technique is very effective as the computer graphic designers can design the graphics effectively according to the actors movements and the script, the actors should imagine the backgrounds which is quite difficult at times.But for this movie shooting, the background graphics were already generated and played in the studio while the actor can feel it and act naturally. The graphics to the viewer may not appeal but in this movie they were apt in the sense that -it's all about the light in the space which may be just white in color or monochromatic theoretically speaking. Narrative is very good with the age old technique of an old person starting to tell the story and the whole story run as a flashback.There have been many movies on the Sci-Fi genre released in the past such as Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future, Steven Spielberg's ET & Close encounters of the third kind, James Cameron's Avatar, Ridley Scott's Alien & Blade Runner, George Lucas's double trilogy Star Wars, and Robert Wise's The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) but Christopher Nolan's Interstellar stands out in many aspects that have not been covered in the previous sci-fi movies that were made over the years.Personally, I still think Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is the best Sci-Fi movie ever made as it has some of the gigantic jump cuts starting from Rock ages to Space ages and concluding in a very convincing theory (Star Child) and the whole movie is a pure experience and allowing the viewer to immerse completely into movie and stop thinking about it. I regret not watching it in a theater especially a large format one. I would say my second favorite Sci-Fi movie is Interstellar.","

"shequk","11 November 2014","Not a terrible movie but not half as good as some reviewers would have you believe. Firstly a lot has been made of you needing a degree in quantum physics to understand the movie. Not so, the premise is exactly the same as his last move 'inception', time moves slower the deeper you go or in this case nearer the event horizon of a black-hole. Don't need to be a genius to understand that.Secondly a lot has been made of his revolutionary mixing of 'dazzling' science fiction and an intimate human story. As for the human story, it's clunky and at times cringe-worthy. It's dull and not particularly well handled with amateurish dialogue characteristic of the Nolan films. If you want to see a movie where the relationship between father and daughter is far better handled watch 'Contact'. As for the science fiction I'd have to say I was disappointed. Parts were very spectacular but I was not impressed by the planet scenes. Iceland yet again and a water planet with shallow seas and massive waves? I was somehow expecting more than this.Overall grossly over-rated by the critics yet go and see it all the same.","

"d_m_s","28 September 2015","I never really felt much interested in Interstellar because I'm pretty bored with Christopher Nolan now. His films are getting increasingly more epic and complex but at the same time, predictable. I just feel I know exactly what I am going to get so don't have any inclination to watch his films.But, stuck for something to watch this weekend, we gave it a go.The last 20 minutes were a bit of an emotional roller coaster (despite what seemed like a few plot holes and inconsistencies, which I need to look into in case I just didn't get it). But it did not make up for the rest of the film, which I found not only boring but irritating.Most of the film I felt was unwatchable because Matthew McConaughey (an over-rated actor whom I don't like anyway) mumbles his way through the entire performance, meaning I had to turn the volume up high to hear what he was saying. However, there are frequent bursts of extremely loud music, far far louder than necessary and since the volume is up high to compensate for mumbling, it constantly suddenly gets too loud to comfortably watch. I had to sit through the whole film with the remote control at the ready, adjusting the volume up and down for the whole duration. When viewing the IMDb boards I can see this is a common problem and it has even been up for discussion in the newspapers. Now, whether Nolan intended this anomaly or not I don't care, it made the film irritating and difficult to watch.Apart from that, I found the whole thing dull. The characters were dull, the storyline was dull and I do not have the desire to watch this film ever again so it has no repeat-viewing value.","

"slowcando","7 March 2015","I hovered for a while over 5/10, but then this isn't an average film...it's below-average. There's not much to recommend it other than McConaughey's decent performance.Here's a few things that's wrong with this picture: the daughter is, to put it bluntly, a stuck-up bitch to her Dad: surely the most undeserving daughter in the entire universe of a reunion with a long-lost father. At least that's how she was portrayed.the premise is pure shlock daftness: it's a silly idea dreamt up as any old excuse for the journey. And I say this as a hard sci-fi fan (or rather, hard sci-fi taught me that the premise in a story was important).the effects are cheap-looking, even wobbly at some points! How on Earth 99% of viewers applaud the effects is truly lost on me. It just looks like a budget TV version of Lost In Space.there's a lot of crying...a lot. Cheesy as hell.the black character dies (obviously not a spoiler).there's some formulaic conflict later in the film which is just dumb and predictable. Don't expect high-end existentialist conflict ala Hal-9000 vs Dave Bowman.the moments of 'tension' are anything but. They're just boring and overlong. The music doesn't fit (sounds like a hyper-ventilating hysterical version of the brilliantly-understated Jonny Greenwood Soundtrack from There Will Be Blood).the other planets' visuals were dull, grey and utterly uninspired.the resolution was more soap opera than science fiction...and the obligatory wormhole/psychedelic sequence was soul-crushingly down-to-Earth. I felt the urge to leave the cinema early at least 3 times.It's not a 1/10 or 2/10, for those are reserved for the absolute worst film I'd consider rating (something like Pacific Rim or Sphere). But 5/10 is genuinely too kind, considering all the things wrong with it. For some perspective: I largely agree with the high scores of all the other films in the IMDb Top 20, and Nolan's last two Batmans are worth a 7/10 (Inception's an 8). Interstellar is just one of those films where I don't for the life of me understand the praise. Recommended for emotional girls with daddy issues.","

"doom-ca","9 November 2014","This movie is everything I expected it not to be. It was dramatic, but not in a good way. Over dramatic. Far, far too predictable, too Hollywood and anything, and I mean anything but scientific. I'm just going to ask this once - Chris,have you ever actually read any Stephen Hawking? Because then maybe the story line could have taken a turn toward science instead of fairy tale, Hollywood pump up the revenue box office production. Maybe someone on your crew could have consulted with Hawking and came up with an alternate ending. One where people who enter black holes get broken up into their atomic parts such as happens to even light. Instead of some fantasy land Disney ride. Wow what garbage.The trailer in this movie made it look like an amazing adventure in deep space. And yes, don't get me wrong there is space, and a few time deadlines to add in some much needed suspense after one too many porch scenes with Grandpa drinking beer while tending the corn fields. However, what this movie lacked was a sense of logic. I mean really. Flat out.The blight that is taking down the humans seems to be completely overlooked in the movie. There really is no information on it except, our atmosphere has a lot of nitrogen in it which is feeding the blight. ""huh?"" The earth is written off in this movie because of blight? This earth has survived, earthquakes, giant meteorites, plagues, famines, flooding and we are done in by a blight?Fine, we can't feed people so we are headed for the stars, all covertly of course. And our hero just happens to stumble upon NASA. Which wants him to be the pilot, even though he's a reluctant farmer, who was a pilot - because as a pilot he's the best of the best with honors. The script felt like something I would read in an old spaghetti western Clint Eastwood movie. I feel like I threw money away on a cheap plot based on oversimplification of scientific notions and box office greed. And the end: omg it's ""time,"" no, no it's ""gravity,"" no it's time. Just stop. And our protagonist surviving a black hole. What? Because it's not a black hole? Human's built it? Future humans. Probably the one's from Futurama. OK I've seen enough roll credits. However, that said, if you want some good sound, yes the sound was good. Good visuals, nothing gravity didn't do better, and descent acting, almost like Armageddon, yah know, the Bruce Willis stuff. Then indeed this is your movie. Trust me, this is no Inception. If you go, enjoy, just don't go in with high expectations (9.1 on IMDb? really?)or you'll be let down.Oh and the 2001 monolith robots were the highlight of the movie for me. They were good for a couple of laughs. Have a good one.","

"bob the moo","19 July 2015","I'd heard fairly mixed things about this film, and often heard praise for elements that I think one shouldn't lead with, so I did put off seeing it until very recently. The reason for this mixed reaction I guess if that it is a very mixed bag of a film, and I can see why people love it, hate it, and a bit of both. The plot sees a series of unexplained events bringing a farmer and former pilot into a group looking to save humanity from the earth, which is currently killing itself and threatening to take mankind with it. Looking to the stars, in particular a black hole which seems to have been placed nearby to allow for travel to much more distant worlds, he learns of previous missions to scout out other planets on the other side, and that he is needed to lead a mission to follow up the promising leads, leaving his family behind potentially forever.To get it out of the way, there is a lot not to like about the film. It runs very long, and at some points this almost seems deliberate – like it has to be a certain length to be able to be called an epic. It also has variable pacing and plotting across this time, with some elements not making logical sense without even having to nitpick on technical details. However, while it doesn't all come together, the film is no less beautiful for what it does while it is trying to do it all. The visual effects are stunning, with believable space travel and worlds created, to the point that although a lot of it is technobabble, you do tend to go along with it and accept everything being laid out. Just as important as the technical, visionary stuff, is that the film has a very human heart throughout. It is surprisingly emotional, even when in the context of pure sci-fi elements; you do tend to buy characters as people, with their flaws, their pain, their motivations – it is surprising how strong the film is in this regard.Part of this working is that the performances are universally strong, although to just pick one – Mathew McConaughey is really great throughout. His down-to-earth elements bring the viewer into the film, while he completely nails the emotional content, which again helps convince us of the reality of the situation and passage of time – because we see how it hits his character, so it must be real. The director marshals all this in a feast for the eyes, heart, and brain – it doesn't all work, like I say, and it is far from being the perfect, flawless film that some would suggest, but it is engaging, thoughtful, heartfelt, and very well made.","

"TheFearmakers","11 July 2023","At one point during INTERSTELLAR, Matthew McConaughey's Cooper is being told that a fifth-dimensional being is trying to logically communicate something to three-dimensional humans, and a mindblown Cooper says aloud that he still doesn't get it...So this time around, writer/director Christopher Nolan outsmarts and outfoxes both his audience and main character... Although there is a fair share of down-home simplicity...A tale about a rural farmer, longing for a purpose in life and who ends up in the far reaches of space, might seem a tad familiar: and just as we get to know Cooper and his children - living on an Earth devastated by ferocious dust storms - he alone winds up soaring to the mysterious heavens...For a three-hour film, it's a surprise that any aspect could be ""too rushed."" Yet the amount of time our potential hero goes from the ground to the sky is as quick as a few instructive paragraphs spouted by chief NASA scientist, played by Michael Caine (and the next scene with father telling daughter he's leaving is actually longer than Caine's scene, which sets up not only the entire plot but all the science as well)...While super-intelligence is essential in any genuine sci-fi flick, and wormholes and black holes are always an intriguing premise, there's so much explaining and anticipating what needs to be done that surprisingly, very little actually happens...These intrepid voyagers, including Anne Hathaway's straight-laced Amelia and a sarcastic robot, experience some extremely close calls and a tremendous amount of docking and spinning, but no real adventure...And whether in space or back on a future Earth... two stories fusing into a M. Night Shyamalan style twist ending... there's no one to completely root for except McConaughey, who can make any character likable...Christopher Nolan's power can't be denied: His DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY created an immense fan base nearly equaling the nostalgic likes of Spielberg, Lucas, Kubrick or any iconic director you choose... but his ambitiously epic INTERSTELLAR both overreaches and overwhelms... not just the audience and characters, but the genre itself...With so many complicated instructions we hardly see the damn thing work!","

"davidmvining","19 January 2021","I have a bias for movies that at least seem to take space seriously. I think it explains why I put Contact atop my list of Robert Zemeckis movies, and I think it's why Interstellar is probably going to end up at the top of my list of Christopher Nolan movies. It's the kind of story that I gravitate towards naturally so that when several movies are at about the same level of esteem in my mind, it's the space stuff that just ends up winning out. The movie still needs to be good though, and Interstellar is great.Matthew McConaughey's Cooper is the exact opposite of The Protagonist in Tenet, which I find interesting and points to why one movie works on an emotional level and the other is more purely spectacle. Cooper has a specific emotional touchpoint, his daughter Murph, where The Protagonist pointedly had nothing specific to drive him to save the world in Tenet. I think it's a testament to some of the more traditional building blocks of storytelling and utilizing them in intelligent ways can lead to more complete stories.So, the world is slowly ending. Blight is killing the world's crops. First was wheat. Soon, okra will be gone. Corn's days are numbered. Blight, thriving on the nitrogen in our atmosphere is killing our food supply and will soon turn to our air supply. Something must be done, so the remnants of NASA have devised a plan to use the mysterious wormhole that has appeared orbiting Saturn to find a new home in another galaxy. They had already sent through a dozen people a decade before, giving them three potential worlds on the other side of the wormhole that they could colonize. Cooper, a former pilot turned farmer, stumbles onto this plot when a gravitational anomaly in his daughter's bedroom gives him a set of coordinates in binary for NASA's hidden base on in old NORAD facility.I think this movie ends up working so well in no small part because of how it begins. Nolan takes the time to set up the world, its deteriorating and diminished condition, as well as Cooper's relationship to Murph which carries him through the entire film. It's for her that he decides to go on this mission through space and gravity, which guarantees that he'll miss decades of her life. It's for her that he wants to return home, to a home where not everyone has died. He's contrasted sharply with Doyle, one of the other astronauts. With no personal connections, he looks at the problem with the least humanity, feeling that their priority should be the quickest and easiest solution in order to guarantee that they save what they can.Also on the ship out is Amelia Brand, the daughter of the chief scientist at NASA trying to figure out the problem of gravity that will get them off the ground in great enough numbers to survive as a species. She has a hidden motive: to reach specifically one of the three worlds, Miller's planet, because she loved him before he left. Her specific attachment drives her just like Murph drives Cooper.Back on Earth, Dr. Brand takes Murph under his wing, getting her into college to pursue an education in physics that is in short supply because the needs of the world are so centered on growing food. She grows into a woman and chief student of Dr. Brand, eventually learning that Dr. Brand had known for decades that there was no solution to the problem of gravity, and that there was never any hope for anyone left on earth. Colonization needed to happen with frozen embryos that the ship carried with it to the other galaxy. In her mind, her father left her to starve and die.This movie has a lot of moving parts, and I haven't even gotten to the three planets, but Nolan handles it so deftly that it's easy to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Nolan has such command over the story and its cinematic rollout that one can lose yourself in the story without ever feeling confused. Combined with the embrace of time mechanics as Cooper's adventures with gravity slow time for him, the movie keeps the different threads extremely clear as they progress at different speeds towards a single conclusion.In terms of the movie's treatment of space, this is where the realistic approach to filming the special effects, with an emphasis on camera placements that are attached to ship hulls, really helps enhance the film's sense of scale and danger. We can hear the rattle of the different parts of the ship scrape and hit against each other as the ship enters the wormhole. When the Endurance passes Saturn, it feels tiny in comparison. When Cooper takes the Ranger into the black hole at the end, it feels terrifyingly huge and dangerous.The first planet they visit is a water planet that stretches time by a couple of decades and shows them a planet void of any life despite the presence of water. The second planet is Mann's planet. Dr. Mann was the best of the twelve, the leader, the one who inspired the original group all to go, and his data on his planet was promising and closer to the first planet than Miller's planet. The time on Mann's planet was shown in trailers, but Mann himself was completely hidden. Played by Matt Damon, he ends up being the manifestation of what Amelia Brand described as nature being violent and overwhelming but not evil. The only evil we can find out among the stars is what we bring ourselves. Mann faked all of his data because he couldn't face dying alone. He was completely selfish, as opposed to Cooper's selflessness centered on his family and even Doyle's selflessness unmoored from any humanity.Now, having said all this, I love this movie as it is. The final act in the Tesseract is the kind of heady thing that embraces time mechanics mixed with emotional storytelling that I love, using science fiction to tell a human story. This also represents Nolan's response to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Nolan obviously loves Kubrick's film, as evidenced by his efforts to have the movie restored for 4K and his many public comments praising the film, but, watching Interstellar, it feels like he has a certain fundamental disagreement with 2001, especially the ending.In Kubrick's film, humanity evolved through Dave Bowman becoming the Starchild after passing through the Stargate. In Interstellar, Cooper remains decidedly human after passing through the black hole and the Tesseract. There's no great evolution. We're still human. When he finds himself on Cooper Station, dozens of years after he had originally left, boys are still playing baseball and cheering when they hit a flyball through someone's window (in a circular design that directly evokes Rama from Arthur C. Clarke, who co-wrote the script for 2001). We can save ourselves as we are, Nolan seems to be saying. We don't need some outside force to take us another step in evolution. We have it in ourselves to take us further. There are other callbacks to 2001 including the use of Saturn (which Kubrick wanted to use late in production instead of Jupiter, but his special effects team rebelled and kept it as Jupiter) and the overall structure of having the Tesseract in place of the Stargate. I love both movies, and Interstellar is great, but it's not quite 2001: A Space Odyssey brilliant.I think this is Nolan at his height. Technically, the movie is at the top of the heap of cinema magic. Narratively, Nolan found a way to keep the stakes of the movie small enough to understand but still tied to a larger problem. In terms of performance, Matthew McConaughey is probably the best leading man Nolan's ever worked with, imbuing Cooper with such pathos as to invite real emotional connection. Anne Hathaway gives it her all as Amelia. Jessica Chastain is wounded and proud as the adult Murph. Hans Zimmer produces one of his best soundtracks using a huge organ at its core. This is Christopher Nolan exploring his cinematic loves at the height of his power in Hollywood, able to turn a heady science fiction script into a rousing and even touching adventure through space and time that made gobs of money at the box office. This is really why I love Christopher Nolan as a filmmaker in general.","

"ssvikas","22 July 2015","Christopher Nolan is known to experiment, such as the the non-linear narrative of 'Memento' and well written characters in 'The Dark Knight'. A director of his caliber also made the disappointing pseudo- intellectual 'Inception'. Sadly, 'Interstellar' too comes across as a let-down of sorts, despite interesting science.'Interstellar' has all the ingredients of a typical space sci-fi film: spacecraft, wormholes, stasis, strange planets, time travel, a black hole, robots running on artificial intelligence, father-daughter drama, etc., in the background of a dying Earth. While these concepts aren't new to Hollywood, the big budget allowed for the visual spectacle. Still, it is marred by choppy narrative, clichéd dialog and poorly developed characters that we hardly care about.Set in unspecified future, Earth's capacity to sustain life has diminished; crops are dying and there are dust storms. Agriculture takes precedence over everything. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former NASA test pilot turned farmer. A widowed Cooper lives with his father in law and children Tom and Murph. An inquisitive young Murph (Mackenzie Foy) is obsessed with the idea of a ghost in her bedroom and is always trying to decode signs.As it turns out, the signs are coordinates to a hidden space station of NASA, headed by Professor Brand (Michael Caine), in search of life sustaining planets so as to evacuate Earth. Predictably, our hero, Cooper is the only man who can pilot the mission to outer space, beyond our galaxy accessed through a wormhole. Damn, a trespasser at a hidden space station is suddenly asked to commandeer a spaceflight without any serious briefing or training!Joining Cooper on the mission are Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) and two other scientists that are expendable. Their mission is finding three of the ten manned probes that went through the portal earlier and have reported seemingly positive findings. Again, don't ask why manned missions when they had advanced AI robots like TARS and CASE? That brings us to the existential question: why a manned follow-up mission, huh?The overarching premise behind the mission is that certain benevolent 'beings' have opened up a wormhole and left clues through gravity- based anomalies. The aging professor has been working on a mathematical model to evacuate Earth. The model fails since it needs data from a gravitational singularity, where space and time can be bent. If Plan- A, to evacuate fails, Plan-B to populate extraterrestrial planets with genetic samples humans.Unbeknownst to the fatality of Plan-A, the crew continues to explore planets. One Planet has time distorted to a level where an hour on it equals seven years on earth. The planet doesn't make the cut due to its shallow waters and gigantic waves. The second is an icy planet with ice-clouds (filmed in Iceland) and a crazed explorer (Matt Damon) who tries to kill Cooper so that he can execute plan B at the third planet, Miller; Result: needless drama.As with every movie involving vehicles, terrestrial or extraterrestrial, fuel shortage and damage to the craft and the need for Singularity data are key plot elements towards the climax. Apropos, they need to slingshot past the black hole to the third planet which Amelia bets on, as her loved one went there during the original Lazarus project. Oh, a movie is so incomplete without a love angle! Glad there wasn't any romance between Cooper and Ameila.And then, our hero, Cooper dives into the event horizon of the beautifully depicted super-massive black hole and reaches singularity. But what is this singularity? Just like the limbo being linked to Cobb's dreams in 'Inception', the singularity in 'Interstellar' is actually a four dimensional tesseract presenting a single location to Cooper at various points in time. And the location? You guessed it: Murph's bedroom. How convenient!So, who's the ghost in Murph's life? Cooper! And the 'beings'? Cooper again! He opened up the wormhole near Saturn that took him through the same spot half a century later. Doesn't this create an inconsistent causal loop just like 'Grandfather Paradox' or a chicken going back in time and laying an egg that it is born out of? But then, an average moviegoer doesn't care as long as there are spectacular sights and happy endings!'Interstellar' is lengthy and tiresome, narrative is patchy and has excessive inter-cuts during crucial scenes. Spoiling experience further is the jarring and ominously heavy background score by Hans Zimmer that muffles out dialog. Acting is just passable: McConaughey is hardly a fit, Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph is decent as the scientist and Michel Caine seems to be having his fourth outing with the director.Nolan's fiction works for audiences who believe they enjoy intelligent films, but actually watch them without thought or logic. As contradictory as it sounds, truth is stranger than fiction. Nolan's 'Inception' was full of plot holes, irrespective of whether it was deliberate or inept storytelling. Usually, a good narrative should have a logical end, except that it is Nolan and he likes keeping things ambiguous. I haven't come across anyone who understood 'Inception' or 'Interstellar' fully, despite claiming that they loved it.About the science in 'Interstellar', Nolan found played it safe by bringing a scientist on board, Kip Thore, as a consultant and executive producer. This would've surely had an impact on the depiction of a spinning black hole and other stuff like the four- dimensional tesseract within the event horizon, boxy but versatile AI robots, etc. Nonetheless, I'm still amazed at how an astronaut can dive into a black hole and come out totally unhurt!!If anything, Christopher Nolan must be admired for dreaming big. Sadly, this movie is a waste of a great concept turned into an average movie that sells only the basis of special effects bankrolled by a big budget. While die-hard Nolan fans would rave over this, discerning movie connoisseurs won't appreciate the poor storytelling.","

"Screen_Blitz","1 April 2015","Christopher Nolan has made big impressions on us with his visual effects, in summer blockbusters like The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception. However, Nolan takes his visual style and narrative talent up to the next level in this complex science-fiction thriller. Matthew McConaughey (Oscar winner from last year's Dallas Buyers Club) stars as Joseph Cooper, a Texas-native father of two children: daughter Murphy and teenager son Tom, living in the not-too-distant future where the world is running scarce on food supply, crops have declined dangerously low and humanity's day are numbered. He is soon called by NASA to take on a mission to travel through the Galaxy in search of a wormhole that could lead to a new home for humanity. Joining Dr. Amelia Brand (played by Anna Hathaway), he struggles against the complexities and perils of the intergalatic environments as well as the decision between saving humanity and the possibility of seeing his family again. This is one of the most visually striking films I've seen in a long time. Christopher Nolan pushes the boundaries of both visual effects and imagination, and brings some eye-popping visuals taking place in outer space you would never forget. The film succeeds not only with ravaging a stunning visual beauty, but also with plenty of scientific food for thought that leaves viewers curious about the nature of astrophysics. The way the film depicts the wormholes and the black holes comes be a cerebral eye-catcher. Now I am not a science guy so I don't how scientific accurate the film is, but it gives a realistic depiction of reality in space. And the plot, though slow at times, manages to associate well with its powerful and scientifically complex story while abandoning its emotional resonance. Some may argue that the plot doesn't quite sustain its 169-minute runtime. Those numbed by the scientific complexity or slow moving storyline may not stay through beginning to end, but there is plenty of strong elements dotted throughout the duration to captivate viewers Let's not forget the incredible performance by Matthew McConaughey. He did a great job on making his character and the bond with his children in the emotional scenes so believable, just by his emotionally driven acting. Anna Hathaway also delivers a performance that stands strong and honorable.Interstellar is a visually stunning, emotionally powerful sci-fi flick full of surprises and thought-provoking elements that could possibly lead this film to stand as a classic within the next decade. This film is an amazing and striking achievement by Christopher Nolan.","

Everything is poor and mediocre in this production. The tonality is set wrong and it is false all through. Then, the cast - Matthew McConaughey is teary, lame and languid. He is the weakest chain here and his efforts to be endearing or touchy do not touch or endear. Anne Hathaway? Probably, her worst part in years. Michael Caine? John Lithgow? Nope, lame at all costs. Avoid this poorly scripted, badly shot, lousily edited slowpoke of a torture. This is just a mere waste of time, and the idea is lost in utter drabness. Let's be honest - I did not understand the idea, the moral and the message. I was totally sucked and drained. And them, this horrendous loud music that deafens the dialog and simply deafens. Why?

"jpt-154-298566","9 November 2014","Let me preface this by stating that I am a big Christopher Nolan fan. Following the success of his ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, plus standalone movies ""Inception"" and ""The Prestige"", we have something of a one-man franchise. Warner Bros signed off on the biggest pre-approved budget in movie history to make ""Interstellar"" without even seeing a script.Going into the movie, I knew that with this kind of creative freedom, there were always going to be a couple of self-indulgent bits and perhaps a few ideas and sequences that the producers would have viciously vetoed with a less powerful director at the helm. But I didn't mind. In today's remake and reboot happy Hollywood, I sat back to enjoy what might be the last movie in a quite a while with an A-list director, completely original story, and a money-no-object budget.Which is why I'm sorry to report that this movie just didn't work for me at all. The problem is that it's not really a movie. It's about three different kinds of movie mixed together, into one very complex but rather indigestible dish. This same approach worked for ""The Dark Knight"", where Nolan threw everything but the kitchen sink into the screenplay and somehow made it all work. Unfortunately, lightning hasn't struck twice for Interstellar. Nolan's intergalactic juggernaut struggles to get off the ground, and when it's finally up there, doesn't really know what to do with itself. Sort of similar to the real space programme.The film opens fairly slowly, mostly in a dusty Midwestern farming community. No problem, in theory - ""Star Wars"" and ""Superman"" both openedlike this, and both were great movies. Then lots of talking heads pop up, like in a documentary. Then, they vanish, and we find ourselves in the middle of what feels like a Depression-era movie with a single father struggling to raise two wayward children on his own.We get a little background on this dystopian world. Big food shortages have created wars, crises, and the government can't afford frivolities such as a space program. Apparently, the Earth is dying, with the atmosphere rapidly becoming unbreathable. Also, there is a drone aircraft flying around - from India, of all places.Then, a ghost, which is actually gravity, communicates with Cooper's daughter by speaking to her by arranging books into barcodes and tells them to go to a secret (fully funded and operational) NASA base which has been hidden from society for decades behind a wire fence in a cornfield. I guess that must be some wire. Space wire. NASA wire.If none of this sounds like it makes any sense, it's because it doesn't. Without a clear direction, Interstellar falls apart. It continues to throw the most disjointed, jarring plot elements lifted from every epoch of space movie our way for the next two and a half hours in what could loosely be called a 'story'. There are bits that feel like ""Gravity"" with super-realistic spaceflight sequences. There are bits that feel like 1960s Star Trek where the famously doomed ""redshirts"" are sent down to random planets to die in slightly comical accidents. If you're detecting a bit of a clash of tone here, then congratulations: Nolan didn't. The unexpectedly mad, undisciplined screenplay continues to ricochet around until the very end, which plays like a cross between ""Inception"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" It's not just the plot which has developed mild schizophrenia either: the feeling extends to the characters. Brand (Anne Hathaway) is introduced as a scientific, hard-nosed foil to Coopers' wild, seat-of- the pants pilot. The movie has a nasty habit of forgetting about her, and she wanders in and out of proceedings to no avail. Then it's revealed that she's in love with an offscreen character who we have never met.All throughout this, we are flicking back and forth between equally weird and random plot developments on Earth. Cooper has left a son and daughter behind. We spend quite a lot of time with the younger daughter (Mackenzie Foy) but then she grows up, becomes a quantum physicist - not bad for a farm hand - and is basically a completely different character, which means all the time the movie spent on the young version is ultimately wasted. Cooper seems to completely forget he has a son as well - we only see him pining for the daughter.It's very important for a film to do is establish its tone and what kind of movie it is within its first ten minutes. Interstellar couldn't do this for two hours. It could have ended in a musical number and it wouldn't have made any more or less sense.I also found myself wondering what they managed to spend the enormous budget on. Take away the A-list actors and there's no reason that this couldn't have been done for $30m. Some of the effects (example: when Mann tries to dock with the Endurance) are actually pretty flimsy. They didn't look or move like real spacecraft at all.For me, the ultimate irony with Insterstellar is that it had two or three ideas which could have been developed into good movies on their own: for example, the idea of an former astronaut having to convince skeptical authorities on an impoverished future Earth that their only chance of survival is a wildly risky space expedition. For better or worse, there is no way Inception would ever have been made without Nolan's involvement. This is the great two-edged sword of creative freedom. I just hope Nolan doesn't become the last ever director to wield it.","

"christopherRclarke","6 November 2014","It might sound arrogant, what i wrote in the summary field, but unfortunately this film misses many aspects of common sense. Given it was a Nolan film I did expect more than this but I think he may be slipping somewhat (the bat bike in Dark Knight Rises flipping over with its magical 360 deg wheel comes to mind).Im not going to get into a full review about what this film is about but I will say that if you are dealing with time paradoxes, make sure you know how to address them and not say 'ah what the hell, the audience won't know...'The film has a wormhole. One that is placed aaaaalllllll the way out near Saturn by someone we don't know (but lead to believe its evolved humans). I say, why not have the wormhole next to Earth? who knows. Did evolved humans make the wormhole? if so, how did they get off Earth to evolve and put it there?To watch the film is nice, the space scenes are stunning and film stock nice. But, no 2001 competitor this time round.","

"sddavis63","1 November 2015","It's almost as if those who made this movie wanted to use two and a half hours of less than stellar movie making (if you'll pardon the pun) just so that the viewer could tough it out to the end and see a ridiculously sentimental ending. Really, by the time the end finally came, I found myself wondering what the point of the whole thing was. Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) is a farmer in the midwest United States struggling along with his family to survive in some future world in which humanity is facing extinction. The atmosphere is changing so that there's less and less oxygen, and it's becoming harder and harder to grow crops. In this part of the world at least everyone seems to survive on a diet of corn, corn and more corn while being constantly threatened by horrible dust storms. I'm assuming this is meant to portray an environmental catastrophe. Eventually, Cooper and his daughter Murph (played as a young girl by Mackenzie Foy, who did well in the part) become aware that they're receiving some strange signal and they head out to investigate - an investigation that eventually leads to Cooper leaving Murph and the rest of his family behind to explore space in the hopes of finding a new home for humanity.I get it. I just didn't get excited by it. And I struggled from the start (well, once Cooper was picked for the mission anyway) with the question of why Cooper wasn't simply recruited for the mission from the beginning. He's clearly the best pilot around - which Professor Brand (Michael Caine) states openly - and he was immediately put in command of the mission, which made me wonder why they were just going to leave him playing farmer if he was really that good! That bugged me all the way through. But what bugged me more was that there was no consistency to this. There didn't seem to be any real direction to it; it didn't seem to be leading anywhere. I thought the storyline involving Mann (Matt Damon) was extraneous and just added time to the movie without adding much in the way of substance. There are a few places where it seemed as if the movie was trying to pay tribute in some way to ""2001"": particularly around the character of the robot TARS, and even some of the special effects/cinematography, but as I said it just didn't seem to be leading anywhere, and I wasn't entirely certain if this mission had accomplished much of anything.The entire movie seemed to be little more than a vehicle getting us to the sentimental ending. Murph had been angry that her father had left her behind, but she remembered that he promised he'd see her again, but because of differences in the way time would pass for the two of them (see: the theory of general relativity) she might be the same age as him by the time that happened. As it turned out, Murph was an old lady by the time Cooper returned to earth, and we get the sight of Cooper visiting his daughter in the hospital on her deathbed. Sentimental, yes, but I'm not sure it made the long wait to get there worthwhile. (4/10)","

It's too long, and way too much time is spent on explaining phenomenons that don't need to be explained. It could have been such an elegant and thought provoking movie, but instead it's dead set on explaining absolutely everything. It ruins the mystery, and the opportunity for me to use my own imagination. Unfortunately the time spent making sure that everyone in the audience understands the movie EXACTLY the way the director wants you to, is spent, at the expense of a good storyline and the development of believable characters and meaningful relationships. A funny idea, and a powerful soundtrack, just doesn't cut it for me. I was very underwhelmed and disappointed, but go see for yourself.","

"ggmcheartagram","13 September 2015","I'm actually really angry right now, a few people recommended this film to me and i just don't understand why?! Maybe i'm just not that smart. I barely understood it and most of it went over my head. I pretty much relied on the synopsis to understand what was going on, and if a film is that hard for me to follow, then it obviously just isn't for me. I can't fault the visuals, music or the majority of the acting - just the story, and in particular the turn it took at the end...what was that? why? there was no need! I was bored at the start. Then the film peaked my interest once they were in space and then the turn it took just made me fed up and annoyed. I don't seem to love Christopher Nolan as much as everyone else does, i enjoyed his earlier films and two of the Batman films but most of his films just end up boring me. It's disappointing because i usually always love his casting choices and i want to like his films but most of them just don't engage me. Maybe he just isn't for me. Jon enjoyed this more than me and gave it 7/10 but even he admitted that he didn't understand the majority of it and he also enlisted the help of the synopsis. I guess if you haven't watched it give it a go, you may enjoy it or like me you might wish that you'd spent the past three hours doing something else...","

This movie is riddled with plot holes, a storyline that is so formulaic and predictable that it borders on something a 5th grader could have wrote. If you watch the first 20 minutes of the movie, the rest of the movie you will just be waiting for the stuff that you know will happen to happen. There is little room for surprise, and even less room for enjoyment.Adding to this, the visuals in the movie are a huge problem, in watching it I got a headache and motion sickness. So not only was I left with a feeling of wasted time after leaving the cinema, I also felt physically ill. I feel the actors in this movie are all outside their comfort zones, and the acting feels very forced, and it feels like not even the actors in the movie want to be a part of it. I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoyed ""The Room"" with Tommy Wiseau, or Gigli with Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez.

"heisenberg12","26 October 2015","It's a pretty good movie. You'll be immersed in the visuals, the graphics, some mystery, and a review on quantum physics in space, and you will enjoy the mysteries contained in it. However, the acting and casting are almost embarrassing at times and poor. The narrative and script suffers greatly from a lack of focus and pointless plot tricks. There's a sequence toward the end that while engaging, is some of the most over the top dramatic, just-for-effects senseless filmmaking you will ever see. It worked in Inception, but not in Interstellar. Overall, it is a ""pretty good"" film, but it falls short in so many categories. The visuals are worth the ride, and the best part is the presentation of the new planets. If only they would have spent more time on the water planet (that was the best part of the movie), but then if they did, every hour was worth 7 years on earth, so the story had to go elsewhere. The other graphics were good too. But there are some senseless plot turns that will frustrate you and it will lose points immediately from its' current 8.7 rating. For example, was Matt Damon's space crazy Dr. Mann even necessary? The answer when you think about it is no. It had no point in the overall story except to add more drama and intensity to an audience who already had plenty to begin with. What a waste of top level talent.","

A film that promises to deliver a realistic cinematic examination of relativity, time dilation and intergalactic travel is actually a cloying family drama in which any semblance of scientific reality gets chucked out the space ship's power window in favor of some smarmy absolute nonsense about benevolent interdimensional aliens (see Contact, also starring Matthew McConaughey for some reason) and the power of love or something.

"andy-66447","24 August 2015","A couple years ago, there was a major motion picture called ""Cloud Atlas."" Never heard of it? That's because it bombed. It was a three-hour marathon of six non-intertwining stories, one of which held my interest. The least interesting depicted a futuristic world of cannibalism and idol-worship on the big island of Hawaii. I wrote at the time that Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are so bad in this story they seem like amateurs. The dialogue is stilted and ridiculous. I couldn't believe Warner Brothers had actually green-lighted this project.Now I've seen something similar. Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is a three-hour convoluted mess of science fiction, with a potentially interesting story buried somewhere deep inside the dialogue. To wit, in the future, the world is approaching the end of its habitability. I don't know why. It has something to do with crop blight, but if the explanation was in the script, I must have missed it. NASA has developed a secret plan to explore other potentially viable planets. Impossible, you say? Ah, but there is a ""wormhole"" near Saturn, which allows astronauts to explore five promising alternatives for the salvation of humanity. (A wormhole is a theoretical means of quickly traveling through space and time, based on Einstein's theory of relativity. Think of it like Han Solo traveling at warp speed, only it's supposed to sound more plausible.) I'm not sure anyone ever explained why all five planets were able to appear in the same place at the same time, when in reality, they must have been light-years apart from one another.The always-reliable Matthew McConaughey plays NASA pilot Cooper, and Anne Hathaway is Amelia, a scientist also aboard the rocket ship. In the best decision writers Jonathan and Christopher Nolan made, no romance is ever suggested between the two leads. I only wish they had done a better job of explaining what ""Interstellar"" is all about.After landing on one of the planets, Cooper and Amelia meet up with another scientist, Dr. Mann, played by Matt Damon, who was stranded on a previous mission. In the strangest plot twist, Dr. Mann tries to kill Cooper for some unexplained reason. Up until this point, I believed I could suspend my disbelief enough to recommend ""Interstellar."" But why wouldn't two NASA employs be able to work together? Is it because Nolan wanted Dr. Mann's shuttle to explode while attempting to dock with the rocket? Could be. Unlike last year's excellent ""Gravity,"" ""Interstellar"" is a loud, busy picture, overstuffed with special effects, unnecessary music, and screaming characters.Eventually, Cooper and Amelia venture into a black hole (yes, on purpose; don't ask why) where time appears spatially, allowing Cooper to visit his daughter in her childhood and warn her to lead humanity to explore other worlds. Ironically, we see this warning at the beginning of the film, before the voyage even begins. It doesn't make sense then, but for my money, it never makes sense at the end of the picture either. Somehow, Cooper doesn't age, yet his young daughter appears as an old woman at the end. Again, it has something to do with Einstein's Theory of Relativity – and therein lay the problem: Nobody understands the Theory of Relativity! All the longwinded scientific explanation of the cast (which eats up most of the dialogue) sounds like a bunch of existential mubmo-jumbo from the original ""Star Trek"" series. It's impossible to follow, due to its complexity, yet it's impossible to suspend disbelief, because the plot is so outlandish. Coming on the heels of Alfonso Cuaron's far superior ""Gravity"" last year, ""Interstellar"" pales in comparison. Much as Stanley Kubrick did in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" Cuaron managed to nail the silence of outer space. ""Gravity"" was a quiet, reserved film, which highlighted the loneliness of space travel. ""Interstellar"" is blaring and assiduous – like a semi-serious ""Star Wars"" crossed with the garbage science of ""Star Trek."" ""Interstellar"" is an old-fashioned Saturday matinée, revved up past power ten with top-notch actors, IMAX special effects, and a music score that just won't stop. ""Interstellar"" is so big and expensive, it was financed by both Paramount and Warner Brothers. It's movie-making on a grand scale. And at that level, it fails. It might have worked, had it simply been stripped down a notch or two. And it's probably just me, but I have a problem with the name. Why would anyone choose an adjective as the name of a movie? Interstellar what? Where's the evasive noun? Probably sitting on the cutting-room floor with Einstein's Theory of Relativity.","

But the story meanders for hours and hours, and any semblance of logic is completely abandoned after the trip through the wormhole, making it very hard to care what happens.Just one example: the takeoff from Earth requires a multi-stage rocket on the scale of the Saturn V. The takeoff from a planet ""near the black hole,"" (!) with ""gravity greater than Earth's"" is handled effortlessly by a tiny shuttlecraft. The movie is filled with similar lapses in basic logic. The final events near (and inside!) the black hole are so completely lacking in scientific plausibility that they'd seem embarrassing in a ten-cent comic book. In a multi-hundred-million-dollar epic, the complete disregard of all known science borders on criminal.On the positive side, Interstellar is a better film than Gravity. The science is equally implausible, but the story doesn't depend on the science quite so obviously. Nonetheless, the popularity of feeble junk like this makes a sad comment on the state of knowledge and tastes in our 21st-century society.","

"ashazjw123","8 February 2023","This movie is the most beautiful, creative, realistic and emotional movie that I have ever seen. I genuinely believe that this movie is the most perfect movie ever. This movie has everything: love, betrayal, suspense, mystery, action, happiness and connection. This movie is just done so well. The plot is so well written. It is very hard to stop watching this movie.The casting is amazing. The acting is over the top. I am starting to think that Matthew McConaughey is one of the best actors ever. The VFX are a beauty and the characters? Don't get me started. The dialogue is written in such a mysterious but realistic way. I am in love with this movie. This is also a very long movie and I do think that it is a bit of a headache but I would be lying if I said that my mind wasn't blown because it was! I don't think I will ever see another movie. 10/10. You have to watch this movie!","

Big fan of Nolan's work, except Inception.The movie is a soup of physics and personalities clichés, overstretched over 3 hours of beautiful visuals braided with a childish plot and stupid characters. A similar movie which comes to mind is Prometheus.There is absolutely no connection with the people involved, and each and every one of them became unlikeable at some point in time.The attempts to define the way people behave are as childish as the plot that reverts into itself. Worse than the worst episode from the Star Trek saga.Apparently Hollywood must stick with the trailers, as they are brilliant. The movies that follow are trash.Nolan should come down from the sky ego he's in, and start making good intelligent movies again. Such a pity...IMDb of 9.3?!

"jassenjj","31 March 2015","The movie delivers some remarkable achievements in cinematography but it cannot be saved. It's naive, boring, silly, tearful and brings the irksome feeling that a decent filming and acting were wasted on a messy story that can be digested only if one leaves aside all their critical thinking. I'm still wondering what is the big flaw of the storyline: is it the fact that it's made out of air, so thin that it resembles vacuum, or is it the super-fast delivery of the space-time-anomaly-behind-the-library explanation of the whole point, right after the ridiculous safe-exit-from-a-spacecraft-inside-a-black-hole drama.Given the overall score here and the reaction of people around me, this movie is a paradox... It provokes contrasting opinions, so inexplicable to the opponent, that it reminds me of #thedress.","

"Diptoman","8 November 2014","DISCLAIMER: I'm in general, a huge Nolan fan.There are times when you can ignore plot holes in films, and times when you can't. You can overlook some when the pacing is fast, or when the film doesn't take itself too seriously. Unfortunately, Interstellar does neither - it's unnecessarily slow and takes itself really, really seriously. And it's full of plot holes, fallacies, paradoxes, and logic taking a beating in general, to fulfill some emotional quotient - which, I must say, worked on most people.Let's start with the whole premise the film is based on - in the future, earth's resources have been drained, and everyone has turned into farmers - with conscious efforts to eradicate science education in general to force people to go into farming. Let's take a moment here to realize just how ridiculous that premise is.Moving on - our protagonist is a genius NASA astronaut/engineer turned farmer (because, y'know, everyone's a farmer) - and the first half mostly shows him bonding with his family, with completely unnecessary scenes to prolong the film - like taking down a lost drone (by pointing things towards it), which had no relation to the story later whatsoever. Then our hero stumbles onto a NASA facility (if you aren't a farmer, you're with NASA) after decoding things which occurred due to... uhh, gravitational anomalies. This NASA facility, as claimed by uberscientist Michael Caine, was humanity's best kept secret, though 5 minutes into that - all our hero's family members were informed about it. So anyways, since our hero stumbled into the facility anyway, uberscientist decides to send him into space to save humanity because, well, just like that. We get to see our hero saying goodbye to his family and immediate fast forward - he's in space! No training, no nothing! Economic storytelling, certainly, and it would've worked, had the other ""scientists"" on board later didn't have to explain things and plans to him on the fly (which, for all intents and purposes, should've been explained before leaving) - and having conversations that were mostly like what college freshmen studying physics would have. (Oh, and discussions about love! Love transcending all dimensions - when humanity is at stake!)Anyway, so future earth has the technology to do all this, and build robot A.I.s which were more human than most humans, but it doesn't have doctors any more, or any other visible technological advancements for that matter. All efforts to save humanity were concentrated on ONE and just ONE uberscientist, who'd been working on his cure-all formula for years. And every other scientist have just been waiting for him to solve it all himself! (And what's this? Other nations you ask? Well there ain't no other nation apart from the USA to do earth saving, is there?) This is something I particularly take offense to, scientists don't work that way.So, Nolan throws more science at us on the fly, which everyone dodges. But in the end, everything is explained by, yep, five dimensional space! Somehow our hero gets into such a space, goes back in time (opening up a ton of paradoxes), behind a bookshelf in 5D space, and uses vague messages to communicate with his daughter back in time, instead of giving clear messages like ""I'm your father back in time"". His daughter, when all grown up - suddenly realizes that it was his father all along and we get no clue as to how she got to that conclusion - but hey, PLOT TWIST! And with that new information, she becomes the new uberscientist, saving everyone. How? By making an orbiting space station around Saturn (for which you somehow required ""quantum data"" from other galaxies and black holes?). So okay uhh... it's complicated.There are however, some great visuals (3D would've done justice) and soundtrack in this, and hence the 5 - but ultimately nothing we haven't seen before. Beyond all that glitter, there's no gold - just a forgettable movie.","

"Jim-Eadon","10 September 2015","This awkward movie felt like Sci Fi produced by a technical, corporate entity. The idea was fairly cute. Much depended on the mourning by the daughter, but the actress didn't make me care about her. The protagonist didn't make me care about him either, for that matter. I thought the female astronaut was quite engaging but the movie was the most interesting, her choices, angst and suffering were the only interesting thing about the movie. The Black Hole stuff was horrible, but even the black hole in this movie is not volume enough for the plot holes and miraculous coincidences that drive the story. He was only able to communicate via a malfunctioning watch, What the...? Nothing in this movie made sense. Every major scene was blatantly impossible. Worst of all, there was no warmth, no compassion, no style, no love.","

Instead of a true vision for the future Interstellar works out an ordinary Hollywood blockbuster that vegetates on emotional blackmail in a father daughter relationship. Sorry Christopher Nolan but this is not what I payed for! Why should man go into space if all he cares about is miserable inter human nonsense? The unprofessionalism of the astronauts is limitless. Austronauts don't go into space without a strict course. So not in Interstellar, in this movie the astronauts choose randomly with course to take. This is supposed to be science? Don't make laugh!

"maryolalov","17 February 2017","A great science fiction movie, with an amazing plot and of course a very talented director. No one can deny Nolan's talent, all his movies are well made and Interstellar is one of his best works. Some people say that the plot of Interstellar is confusing but I don't think so (maybe because I've watched this movie more than 20 times). Still we can say that it's a bit confusing if you're watching it for the first time but don't worry it won't be confusing after the second or the third watch.Something that really impressed me in the movie is that when something explodes in space, there is no sound, simply because of the vacuum. In many science fiction movies the audience can hear the sound of explosion, gun fire,etc in space, which makes it look less realistic. But in Interstellar every single thing is physically correct, because Nolan had many consultations with physicists to make the movie realistic.Interstellar has many emotional and dramatic scenes too which makes it different from the other science fiction movies. It shows us the pain of a father who left his kids and went to space to search for a new home for the mankind.Interstellar is an amazing movie and it's definitely worth watching.","

"pwiener-592-552778","6 November 2014","I was bored and love science fiction movies, so I saw half of ""Interstellar"" - way too much of it. Since I expected nothing, I wasn't disappointed: that's what I got. Few friends probably planned to see it, so there was no point in telling them not to. It has not a single redeeming feature, and shamelessly copies many films and TV series - 2001, not the least of them. I've seen better sci-fi on 50s or 70s television. It's 100% cliché-ridden from the git-go - the characters, the story, the actors (no acting is necessary!), the ""cinematography"" (almost non-existent) the music, the locations, the sets, even the editing. What an embarrassment, an insult. It's a film worthy of this year's midterm elections, as it cynically abandons all pretense and respect for imagination, experience, science, detail, creativity, or humor. It is written and plays to the lowest level of intelligence - the entire film does nothing but fulfill expectations set in the first few minutes. You might as well listen to the movie as a podcast. Matt McConnaughey has never been so stereotypically bad. I hope it destroys a few careers. It should.","

"faruqueshahriar","30 August 2023","Interstellar is an absolute masterpiece that left me in awe from start to finish. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, combined with a thought-provoking story and stellar performances, creates an unforgettable cinematic experience.From the very beginning, the film captivates with its stunning visuals and breathtaking space sequences. The attention to detail in the visual effects is mind-blowing, making every moment feel incredibly realistic. The vastness of space is beautifully portrayed, leaving viewers with a sense of wonder and insignificance in the grand scheme of the universe.The story itself is a captivating blend of science fiction and human emotion. It explores profound themes such as love, sacrifice, and the boundless nature of human curiosity. Interstellar takes its time to delve into complex scientific concepts, making it both intellectually stimulating and emotionally engaging.Matthew McConaughey delivers a mesmerizing performance as Cooper, a former pilot turned astronaut. His portrayal of a father torn between saving humanity and his own family is deeply moving. Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and the rest of the cast also deliver exceptional performances, adding depth and authenticity to their characters. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is nothing short of extraordinary.Interstellar is not just a movie; it's an exploration of the human spirit and our relentless pursuit of knowledge. It challenges us to ponder the mysteries of the universe and our place within it. This film will stay with you long after the credits roll, leaving you questioning the boundaries of time, space, and the power of love.","

"sleons","16 March 2015","Don't waste your time watching this film. Every interesting idea about the movie is thrown out the window half way through. I found fascinating the parallel story that's being told between the main character and his daughter. At some point Nolan no longer cares for this so he decides to use time however he pleases. The film is a huge contradiction. And the way it is solved is just confusing and pretending to be more complex than it actually is. They are on a mission that's more important than any personal issue, man kind's future depends solely on the success of it. But fø©k that, in this kind of Hollywood bullshit protagonists can't die (just because test audiences don't like that, it makes them really really sad) so against all odds McConaughey makes it back home. Hooray for him, and for all the idiots who need this kind of ending.Mark my words... by the time Matt Damon appears you will be compelled to kick Christopher Nolan right in the balls.I read that they were advised by physicist in order to be ""scientifically accurate"". I'm sure every accurate idea came from other films like 2001, event horizon, etc. Interstellar is a cash grab. If you spent your money on this be sure to check on your butt hole. Christopher Nolan might have already had his way with you. My asshole is intact because I torrented this bad boy. Suck on that film industry!","

"writers_reign","8 November 2014","I'm probably not the target audience for the freres Nolan as I tend to notice things instead of being seduced. Take the opening. We're in East Jesus in the heart of the dust bowl. An ordinary family, a wooden home one step up from a tarpaper shack. Inside an equally ordinary kitchen THEN, in the bedroom of the daughter of the house, Murph, we find FLOOR-TO-CEILING BOOKSHELVES? Fully stocked. You're putting me on, right, Chris. More? Seems the father of Murph is an ex pilot who has retired to become a farmer. No real problem there BUT, he and Murph stumble on some co-ordinates and follow them to a top-secret NASA base where the head honcho is Professor Michael Caine. They show the intruder the latest space-ship, explain that earth is running out of food and the only solution is to find a planet that will sustain human life AND THEN invite him to lead the mission. This is a guy who hasn't flown in x amount of years and may or may not be in shape. There is no training programme, no vetting, the whole thing resembles a car salesman offering someone who walks in off the street a chance to test drive the latest top-of-the-range Lamborghini. If you can get past this nonsense you may well enjoy what follows. Unlike, say, Gravity, which was virtually one hundred per cent in space, Intersteller does introduce a human element and is all the better for it. Clearly the Nolans are interested in exploiting technology at the expense of constructing an even halfway plausible screenplay and there are probably enough overgrown schoolboys out there who will respond to cgi the way Pavlov's dog responded to a bell.","

"paulcf-510-910462","9 November 2014","I had high expectations for this film by Chris Nolan. ""Inception"" was ground breaking, you could definitely say it had never been 'done before' or seen that before! The pre release hype was strong for Interstellar and I really enjoy SF movies, so pass the popcorn!SPOILERS: Firstly character wise...There is zero chemistry between Cooper and Dr. Brand! Yet in the end, we're being told/shown that there is/will be? Really? Then Dr. Mann, he was asleep for years and when they wake him, they don't verify his claims? And his mental status? Why was he sent on this mission in the first place? And he easily removes the communication device from Cooper's helmet, and so on. Really cheesy and poorly written. Then he escapes in the craft to get to the Endurance, hello? No security protocols? It is so unbelievable.Time flashbacks...Cooper can revisit time, so why not pick a time he can really affect? Maybe further back and even help to prevent the natural environmental breakdowns that Earth is experiencing in this story.Robots...black monoliths...hello where have I seen that before? Is this the shape that a space exploration robot would be designed as? This was so silly I couldn't stop laughing!Fuel: They have a limited supply! OMG! Ever hear of nuclear power like in a submarine, etc? Also I would expect them to have perfected nuclear fusion or such to provide unlimited (almost) power. But no, they use chemical rockets (technology from the 1940's). This was so poorly written.Let's not forget 'Waterworld' even, when they land on the water planet. Gee, maybe a survey/probe first would be in order? And then the other planet, looked a lot like the ice world in the 'Star Trek' movie a few years ago where Jim Kirk is exiled to and meets Spock.And the most bizarre of all? He gets coordinates of a TOP SECRET base and he's just the person they want to fly the spacecraft? And no one else could find this base? Did the workers there need food from local providers? Anyways, you get my point, it is so disjointed and when you watch it, it is a melange of many previous movies, hence Heinz 57 varieties. It carries bits of '2001 A Space Odyssey' (and its sequels also) which is a natural one to look to. Then 'Contact' and many more...truly picking experiences from a bevy of SF movies and mixing them. At least they didn't have thruster sounds in space! (no sound in space, remember 'Aliens'? No one will hear you scream!) Is this the best that Chris Nolan and Hollywood can come up with? No original screenwriter/story out there? My final measurement of a film is will I buy the Blu-ray disc when it comes out? Nope, not for this extremely long and drawn out film. I might buy it in the cheapo bin for $3.99 in a few years time and watch it just for the extras/deleted scenes and then put it on the shelf to gather dust.So just like in the movie, I was hoping for a worm hole to get to the end of this long drawn out tedium...but unfortunately for me, time was actually going to be moving much longer than normal time and I've lost 3 hours of my life I'll never get back. So terribly disjointed with decent actors trying to save it.Unless you are starving for a SF movie, avoid this like a bad worm hole and keep your feet planted on terra firma. Folks, this is a really terrible movie and I would avoid it and save your money for something else.","

"bschultz_the_pally","7 November 2014","Interstellar marks a critical moment in the career of Christopher Nolan; he has come a long way from being the indie noir director of Memento and Insomnia, to striking gold in the enormously popular Dark Knight franchise. Inception was proof Nolan could successfully tackle a big- budget, original idea outside of the Batman series, but with comic book films behind him, Interstellar has to sell on the promise that Nolan is not a one-hit wonder of big-budget original ideas.The movie's plot focuses on Cooper, a Southerner and family man who doesn't quite understand why man is turning away from flight. ""We used to look up at the stars and wonder about our place in the stars,"" he says, ""now we just look at the ground and see dirt."" Matthew McCoughaney shines in the role of Cooper, delivering one of his career-best. Cooper is an everyman, and nothing in this world (or any other) is more important to him than his kids; in particular, his daughter Murphy, played spectacularly by Mackenzie Foy.Despite great performances from a huge ensemble, beautiful visuals and setting, shot by first- time Nolan cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (Let The Right One In), Interstellar features a typical problem in every Nolan movie: too much expository dialogue. It is very obvious in numerous moments that Nolan is trying to feed us information and backstory. My other issue with the opening of the film is pacing. Thought the movie establishes the world and doesn't rush to do so, the movie rushes off into space the moment the idea of interstellar travel is introduced. From the first act, it is unclear whether Interstellar can deliver. It's in the second act where the movie really begins to blossom. Much of the film from this point on is set in space, and boasts mind-bending special effects as timeless as 2001: A Space Odyssey. The movie features some strikingly similar shots, clearly paying homage to the classic space opera. A lot of the shots are wonderful, and Interstellar features the best cinematography in any of his films (sorry Wally Pfister), but a few times, I found myself wondering the purpose of some of these shots of the ship ""Endurance"". Interstellar reaches for the stars, but in act two still seems unsure of where it may land.In addition to great visuals, the sound design and score are top-notch. Hans Zimmer does some of his best work, bringing in a score that is both celestial and organic; it perfectly balances tones we normally associate with outer space, while hitting all the right emotional notes. And the movie knows when to be quiet in space; not just outside the ship, but inside. I loved the moments where things were so silent you could hear the background whirring of computers, the slight creaking of the ship, the breath of the characters. The attention to detail in both sight and sound made the movie feel real.When the plot does finally introduce a ""villain"" in it's second act, the movie starts to feel it may have overstayed it's welcome. Interstellar runs at 169 minutes, and it's a long one admittedly. Cooper and Amelia, played by a well-cast Anne Hathaway, are finally forced into unforeseeable circumstances, and Christopher Nolan does not hold back. This makes for some heartstring- tugging sequences, and Interstellar may have benefited from stepping on the brakes with some of the emotionally heavy content, but the acting is so good, that it doesn't matter if it's slightly overdone, and it all builds it to a marvelous climax.Interstellar's third act is as stunning as anything I've ever seen in film. For critics who thought Inception was proof that Christopher Nolan was not very imaginative visually with free reign, Interstellar proves them wrong. Thematically and scientifically, the movie dares to challenge, it dares its audience to follow into the unknown, beyond the horizon. I am still trying to wrap my head around it all.Nolan's blockbuster epic is not perfect, and it's not for the common audience. If you're looking for big action sequences, or looking to turn your brain off for awhile, you're in the wrong movie. It's got some bumps along the way, but Interstellar is visionary for our time, and so bold in its execution, that it is not bogged down by its few flaws. I was thrilled to take the ride. Interstellar is thought-provoking, emotional, cinematic, and a wonder to behold, which in time, should earn its title in the league of great science fiction.Grade: A+","

"BRYN-26","9 November 2014","Originality: This movie was completely original, in the exact same way that the Hunger Games was, that is, not at all. The Hunger Games is to Battle Royale as Interstellar is to 2001: A Space Odyssey, that is, a complete rip off. Many reviews are saying how original it is, I expect these people haven't seen 2001.Score: A few people have drawn parallels with Contact, saying that the movie reminds them of Contact. Perhaps it is the pulsating metallic base throbbing noise that Interstellar ripped off?Millennium Falcon: When our heroes first take off from Earth they do so in a Saturn V type moon rocket, with the exhausted stages falling away behind them. Yet, when they later take off from the extra-solar planets, one with 130% gravity no less, they do so in the conventional Millennium Falcon kind of sci-fi way. It huts my eyes!Southern Drawl: Our hero seemed to of had a stroke for the first half of the movie and had slurry half-awake speech, yet later seemed to recover. Perhaps that's what time-dilation does for you!The Robot: Seriously? I think it was so big and square because it contained two CRT-monitors. If you asked a 10yr old to draw a robot design that would be useful on a space mission, then it would undoubtedly improve on the one in Interstellar. But my biggest gripe was, how did it walk? We have two legs(!), our trailing leg doesn't catch on the floor as it swings forwards as our foot extends, lifting us slightly. The robot in Interstellar walks like a pair of chopsticks (but without the accompanying side to side wobble that would be necessary if you chose such an impractical design).Newton's 3rd Law: Stated correctly, applied incorrectly. If our heroes' spaceship had been launched backwards like a bullet from a gun, then it would have been a cool quip, instead it made him look like an idiot corn farmer.The Best of the Best: Why! Why is Hollywood obsessed with the hero being the best of the best of the best? Couldn't he just have been one of the remaining pilots of average competence? (with a genius daughter and an idiot son).Frozen Yoghurt: At one point the Millennium Falcon Space Shuttle hits a cloud made of frozen yogurt (or was it ice?), so, a cloud hanging in the air made of strawberry yogurt, sounds a bit silly. Presumably, as with Arthur Dent's cup, it was held up by art?Emotional: But not a black hole. Possibly the best element of the movie. The human element, and the pain of loss and separation was, strangely, conveyed extremely well.A real Black Hole: Well, I wish I had one so I could get the 3 hours back that I lost watching this. It's not all bad, some bits are compelling, but mostly it's a boring re-skin of 2001.","

"Ketzel","17 February 2015","This movie was so boring I literally had to leave the theater before I fell asleep sitting upright. I gave Interstellar a full hour to get more interesting, considering the rave reviews and ratings on this site that prompted me to see it. But I couldn't wait any longer.The film was scientifically implausible to such an extent that I could not suspend disbelief and enjoy the film at face value. The character development was weak, the protagonist was arrogant and unlikable and the acting talent of many great actors was utterly wasted on this bomb. The dialog was predictable, unimaginative and flat. While it did not affect the quality of the film, I was disappointed that the movie was based on the dangerous delusion that human beings might be able to find a new home in space, so people don't have to think too much about taking action on the very real climate change that is destroying planet Earth right now. But it was the series of stupid moments in the first hour that informed me Interstellar was not going to meet my standards for an intelligent film. The first stupid moment was during the life-threatening giant dust storm scene, complete with large chunks of flying debris. After the family jumps into the truck and races home for shelter, the driver inexplicably parks the truck about fifteen yards away from the front door so that they all have to run outside through the dust storm before reaching the house. Huh?Another stupid moment was when the protagonist is asked to pilot a gargantuan state-of-the-art space craft (apparently built by a few dozen people without any budget) less than an hour after he first surprises NASA with his first arrival. This pilot has not flown an aircraft for years and there is no way anyone, no matter how experienced he once was, could fully master the technology of this ship and be prepared for a complex space mission in the extremely short period of time that elapsed (evidenced by no change in the age of the pilot's children) between being asked to captain the ship and actually doing so. He almost instantly assumes full command of the ship and the crew and successfully takes the ship into deep outer space on a dangerous mission. This sequence of events had no credibility. It felt like some adolescent boy's fantasy come true.The last-straw final stupid moment was when I realized that the female astronaut played by Anne Hathaway is wearing fresh make-up everyday including false eyelashes. Not a big deal considering the major problems with this film, but it nevertheless annoyed me. What competent astronaut is going to waste time and energy applying false eyelashes in outer space during a serious space mission? How would several years worth of cosmetics (along with false eyelashes) even get approved as cargo given the severe space limitations of a spaceship? How are we supposed to find this astronaut credible?That's when I realized it really was time to abandon the film. I was getting downright irritable.","

"interestingfunstuff","8 November 2014","That's the score from a group of 7 friends who went to see Interstellar tonight. I've never been to a film in my entire life so full of DESPAIR. If I hadn't been with friends I would have walked out! I will avoid films by this director in the future like the plague.The only friend who liked it said she enjoys soap operas. That pretty much sums it up! IF YOU LIKE SOAP OPERAS YOU WILL LOVE INTERSTELLAR! There are so many plot holes several of us were cracking jokes by the end of the movie. So many parts of Interstellar are so ridiculous or makes no sense -whatsoever- it borders on camp. Sure the cinematography is magnificent. But in the end it's nothing but pretty wallpaper when the story is drawn out, tedious, annoying, maudlin, nonsensical, irrelevant, dopey and depressing. All I can say is when the only food humanity has left to eat is corn & corn products, then you are going to end up with a very corny movie!","

"alan-467","14 December 2014","I'm writing this review a month after seeing the movie, so I could be excused for forgetting some of the details. In fact, I've forgotten almost everything about the movie as I've got no idea what it was about!I have a minor hearing problem. It rarely causes me any trouble, but 30 minutes into the movie, I realised that I had not been able to understand a single sentence - either because the ""background"" music was so loud, the dialogue was so soft, or I couldn't understand the actors' accents. I didn't walk out because I thought that the visuals may have helped, but two hours later I still had little idea of what was going on, and I didn't believe any of it anyway.I've given it 2 out of ten for the photography and special effects, which were amazing. If I thought it might have a reasonable plot, I would have considered buying the DVD when it comes out so that I could read the subtitles, but, having read IMDb's description of the story, I don't think I'll bother.","

"shail_thegreat","12 November 2014","Yup Nolan did it again and this time he has taken his movie to another dimension.!!'Interstellar' is the story of a man trying to save his family and then saving humanity from extinction. Its full of space adventure and breath-taking actions on some of the most beautiful and unrealistic locations around the UNIVERSE. To realize Nolan's master-piece it Is better if polish our ideas about space-time theory. We know space is defined in 3 dimensions and Einstein in his theory of relativity uses Time as the 4th dimension. But Scientists in the movie realize that Gravity has the tendency to flow across all these 4 dimensions and thus Gravity is designated to be the Fifth Dimension. It is believed that whoever holds to understand and master the knowledge of this 5 dimensions will be able to move anywhere in Time and Space. In this movie a certain species referred as ""THEY"" has the knowledge of this five dimensions and it is THEM who wants Humans to save themselves.In the film various Scientific and Astronomical theories are used, and it will help if viewers have a brief idea about them too.Murphy's law- It is an adage or epigram that is typically stated as: Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. A statement relating possibilities with Certainty.Worm hole- It is a bridge, a hypothetical topological feature of space-time that would fundamentally be a shortcut through space-time. A wormhole is much like a tunnel with two ends, each in separate points in space-time. Though undiscovered, Some believe that wormhole could be used to travel through galaxies.Black hole- It is a region of space-time from which gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Inside the hole what happens is still a mystery, and that's where Nolan's creativity brings about.The movie is filled with unproved theories and unrealistic scenarios. But the way Nolan has directed it, you wont want to blink you eyes even for a moment. The graphics are, no doubt, marvelous. The cast did a stupendous job and . Though laws has been broken to keep the ending sweet, it is well deserved as LOVE has no rules and no dimensions.Conclusion: Watch it again and again.. and it gets better and better.!","

"elmerflp","8 November 2014","The hype was monumental, so I just had to go see it. Oh the humanity! Oh the Humanism! Oh the special effects! My boy and I left the theater blinking and scratching our heads over the loose ends and the heavy slathering of deep inner meaning which, unfortunately, proved largely incomprehensible for our plebeian minds. Oh well. The similarities to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" were embarrassing at some points, although I assume most current movie goers have not seen this 46-year-old film. Throughout Interstellar, there was a lot of weepy overacting in various attempts to dramatize the effects of relativity on time and the resulting differences in human aging. Then there was the subtle, underlying message that humans are the gods who will rescue humanity. I prefer the capital-g God as my rescuer, thank you. This film was a special-effects extravaganza, but, ultimately, pretty lame.","

"DKosty123","29 November 2014","The effects on this one remind me of Kubrick some how. Earth is in major trouble and some folks have to go into space to save the human race. While this type of plot has been done before, this approach seems fresh and realistic. That is because real (scientists ) were hired to consult on the film. It gives a major upgrade to this movie over some other recent films where this plot was used.So the reference to the government altering school books because they faked the Apollo missions to the moon might be a bit far fetched, but there are fans of Kubick who insist he filmed the real moon sequences in the 1960's meaning they are not real. There are some realistic scenes on earth here with farms and problems threatening earth. Michael Caine is here as the planner of the space mission of 3 years to try and save the earth. This is not a perfect planet, but you pretty much figure out we have to help each other to save it but strange leaders are preventing that.It is amusing when Caine finds out late in the movie that a lot of his work was off because he might have focus on the wrong theory all his life. All to true and much too often in the real world.","

I enjoyed the cinematography and the effects but there is really nothing else about this film I can say I liked.I think Matthew McConaughey is a great character actor but in this film he just didn't fit, for me. His voice, stance, mannerisms all seem out of place. Like he just didn't care and wanted the paycheck. Not that all the blame for the bad film can be put on his shoulders. The rest of the cast, all but a small few of them, just weren't entertaining.From the maker of Inception I expected more. What I got was nearly 3 hrs of not a very good film.3/10 for the visuals. That's all I got. Disappointed.","

"a_sad_cow","10 November 2014","The beginning is awesome. Matthew McConaughey establishes himself in what could be one of his greatest roles. The themes of the movie are powerful, covering our inability to forecast/compensate for a changing ecosystem coupled with our stubborn refusal to fund great endeavors like NASA. We do need to get off this planet and that's about where the movie ends for me.Because they're stealing from the Inception/Transcendence genre, we start seeing plot devices for the sake of plot devices, some of which make no sense. This wormhole for instance. Or the tesseract. If humanity doesn't survive Earth, how does it retroactively create the impressive and nearly impossible things they're going to save humanity with. It's the kind of paradox that movie-goers pay good money for and leave good reviews, but it's ultimately garbage.What also got me was the reused tropes. 2 main characters and an extra on a mission. Does this guy die or go crazy? Die. Check, next one goes crazy. Check. And that ending...the whole ""if you want it bad enough, things will turn out good"" bit. Nothing to do with saving yourself.","

"paris_whitney_hilton_nyc","8 November 2014","This dreary , boring , depressing , and overly long sci-fi flick is about the dying Earth and the last desperate attempts to repopulate another world with human beings . Unless you are Stephen Hawking or Neil deGrasse Tyson, or you possess a degree in quantum physics , thermodynamics , time warps , black holes and worm holes, you will not understand all of the technical jargon the viewer is constantly bombarded with . To make matters worse, Matthew McConaughey is probably the best mumbler in Hollywood . I did not understand a single line that came out of his face !... Anyway, The Great Dust Bowl of the 1930's has returned to wreck havoc on the world, only this time it really means business . Matthew McConaughey , the world's greatest astronaut turned farmer , is chosen to be the Earth's savior . His interstellar space craft Endurance ,is capable of traveling through the vastness of space and time . It is also armored like a battleship that can withstand explosions , collisions , and a gigantic tsunami wave 1,000 feet high . Anne Hathaway is the cryogenics expert . She looks a lot more convincing playing Catwoman than the Endurance's genius co astronaut . This movie is quite confusing for the average movie goer with an IQ of under 140 to comprehend . Interstellar is gloomy and awful and definitely not worthy of your two and a half hours .

Nothing is better than your first time watching this movie because it will blow you mind. One is the reasons this movie is loved so much is because of the highly scientific accuracy, I honestly cannot express how amazing this movie is and how beloved it is to me. The movie is completely mind boggling and I love it so much. Everything was great, the plot was 10/10, pacing was 8.9/10, cinematography was 11/10, acting was 10/10 so overall 10/10.

"iamchrisallan","16 November 2014","I came out of the film thinking it wasn't bad but it just wasn't good either. After 24 hours of mulling it over it's dropped further in my estimation. Initially I just thought that if he had presented the same stuff in 1hr 49mins instead of 2hrs 49mins it would have been good but having had time to reflect, even that would not save it.I know that there is no sound in space but those moments of silence were really odd especially during explosions. It dulled all the excitement. The film was hugely lacking in suspense or tension.There are so many things wrong with the film and they are all topped off with the cheese-ball ending.Spoilers! Here are some of the irksome plot holes. Her dad is the ""ghost"" in the bookshelf who leaves her a message. The message that he doesn't leave is ""It's me, your Dad""If our future selves can transport Cooper through time and space why not put him in the bedroom and not in the book case. Why leave a message in binary or morse, why not just write it in the dust with the gravity?Why did Cooper take notice of the co-ordinates but not the message that said ""Stay""?Matt Damon was trying to describe how desperate he was to see fellow humans but no one gave a thought for the astronaut still on the main ship for 23 years.If you had secretly built a rocket that was mankind's last hope why would you ask a farmer, an ex-pilot to fly it at a few days notice?What the hell was Michael Caine rambling about in his death scene? What was he lying about and why the hell didn't our future selves communicate with him instead of a teenage girl?Blackboard mathematics? Really? Do mathematicians still write on blackboards? I suspect they have something slightly more sophisticated. I have seen the Big Bang Theory and even Sheldon Cooper uses a whiteboard and dry wipe pens.When Cooper disengages his craft and falls into the black hole so Brand can follow her heart it was so reminiscent of Bruce Willis staying behind in Armageddon that I wanted to barf. Not really a plot whole, just a reminder of more space hero cheese.The biggest goof of all for me was the ending. His aged daughter tells him to go after Brand. Now, hang on a minute, didn't he set Brand on her way to find her lover Edmund? Did I miss something? Did people find out that Edmund was a gonner? I don't think so. That means Cooper is potentially on his way to be the biggest gooseberry in history (or in the future) ever? Imagine that, Brand and her lover Edmund all set to be the new Adam and Eve when Cooper flies in all ready to procreate. I must have missed a key plot point. Had they fallen in love on the mission but there hadn't been time to cover it in 2hrs 49 mins? My final comment: I liked the robots.","

"winopaul","8 February 2016","I loved Gravity, since it was an exploration of human drama. I loved the Star Trek remake since it JJ is pretty dang good, and it was all make-believe and whizzy. I hated this movie. There were respites. When Matthew McConaughey's said ""I could fly around that neutron star."" I burst out laughing, it was so preposterous, so absurd and so lame. I will admit, he sold the line. If he can pretend to be imaginary people and lie so effectively, it makes me worry about politicians and my friends.It really scares me that Nolan thinks this movie makes any sense. Has his brain turned to Yorkshire pudding? It was written as a series of dramatic expedients. Like Chris just had to have a dust-bowl, so there was a dust-bowl. And Chris just had to have a big ol' rocket launch. There had to be wormholes and time travel and sinking to the level of M. Night Shyamalan, a twist at the end.Another annoyance is Nolan's British elitism, that farmers are dumb peons that don't need to go to college. Note how Coop loves his troubled intellectual daughter and not the son that ends up feeding the planet.Even with these great actors, the situations were so preposterous it was impossible to feel anything but pity for the agents that got them into this mess. A near-future dystopia, where there are cars and trucks but not phones or letters or internet. No government, but no MS13, Hell's Angels and Mafioso raping your daughter. The occasional pervasive dust storm. But the crops grow OK. Until they don't. And somehow we know the planet is doomed, if only because some jerk says it is.There is a huge NASA installation a few hours drive away, but nobody knows about it. Coop sends co-ordinates so he knows it is there. Nolan might want to ask Kip the science guy about causality and determinism. No government, no gasoline, but we have NASA and suspended animation since Nolan needs that little plot trick. Its a drive-by script-- spray some more clichés at it until they call you a genius.And folks, you can't drive into a black hole. Its not black because its mysterious and can be used for incredibility stupid plot tricks. Its black because it rips everything into elementary particles and then perhaps super-strings. There is no daddy's little time-travel library of earthy delights inside a black hole.This could have been OK, it could have been Mad Max crossed with Groundhog Day. Instead, it is just mush, good to keep infants amused with pretty colors and motion, but complete nonsensical mush for adults. Matt Damon was lucky to get blown out into empty space in that little plot cliché. I felt more empathy for the creature in Aliens getting blown into space than I did for Matt.To recap the 7 places in the movie: Home life--BS situation, BS character interaction. Space central- BS situation, BS characters. Space ship, BS situation, BS characters. Planet one- BS situation. Planet two-- BS situation, BS character, BS interaction. Black hole-- BS everything, and I mean every single thing. Planet 3, BS trite. Home again-- BS situations, BS characters, BS interaction.Please studio heads and finance people stop indulging this madman with his infantile fantasies. Even Lord of the Rings was better than this.At this point I usually imagine how I would save the film. Its not re-shoots, every single scene and every single line is stupid, there is nothing here to save. OK, I have calmed down and I can no more give up on a crappy movie than on a baby drowning in a swimming pool. So, add the roving Mad Max gangs that rip him off and pillage and steal. Then they come for his daughter. The NASA installation is not some secret, its where they have been launching the Skynet robots to control us all, right before things collapsed. So Coop takes his little girl, and commandeers a spacecraft. We need the gal, and the black guy but not the other white guy-- what ever happened to him anyway--- Oh, he drowned in Waterworld. I assume he is some famous high-dollar actor, save the money for special effects. OK, now when I saw the cool black guy, I muttered ""He's as good as dead"" and sure enough, like all cool black guys in every science fiction movie, he died. So lets go against the grain and promise that no matter what, the cool black guy lives. Cut out Waterworld, we already lost the dufus white guy that drowned there. Cut out the black hole-- it is absurd, stupid and insults our intelligence. Cut out the third planet, this script is too complicated as it is.No, they fly to the Matt Damon planet and yeah, he can be a creep. OK, now we have the making of a third act. It revolves around who the women will pick to mate with. Daddy's little girl has grown up, and that science gal is pretty hot as well. I leave it to you to select the ending: 1) The black guy ends up with both of the gals, bless him, and maybe pimps them out (cliche alert). 2) Matt ends up with the daughter, and he beats her and is a drunk (hillbilly heaven). 3) Matthew ends up with his own daughter, since their relationship seemed unhealthy anyway. 4) There are three guys and two gals so pick the guy that ends up alone. 5) The two gals go carpet muncher and leave all the guys in the cold, human race dies. 6) Any two guys being gay leaves both gals for the other guy, unless #5). 7) The Strangelove prodigious breeding ending, where all the guys jump both girls over and over and over and over and over.... well, you get the idea.","

"ironhorse_iv","17 November 2014","Interstellar will divide the audience. Some of them will love and enjoy this movie, while others will see it as a boring film and feel the long 3 movie pace. Interstellar is no way, a popcorn fun film. It's a smart man film. It's remind me, so much of 1968's 2001: A Space Odessey, both in visuals and how people reaction to it. Both films, receive mixed reactions from critics and audiences alike. I think like 2001: A Space Odyssey, this movie, Interstellar will garnered a cult following and slowly became a bigger box office hit, but right now, it's up in the air. While, the movie seem to taking a lot of homage to that film, Interstellar seem grounded by the director own identification. It's a film that couldn't blast away, even if a lot of determination went into making this film. The reason is, because people have become so aware of what Director & Writer Christopher Nolan will do. Without spoiling it, too much, the movie has a lot of overused Nolanism tropes & clichés. This means a lot of exposition dialogue with characters explain through dialogue their innermost feelings, instead of, acting those emotions out. Add the elaborate, flashback-heavy narrative structure, and lots of science mucho jumbo, and you get a film that will confused people. Some people think, it is a fallacy, but in my opinion, it's not inherently bad. They're alright in the right doses. People need to be challenge in films. People need to think. If you're so caught up on Nolanisms, you'll never let yourself enjoy the film, as a whole. I think some people just didn't get it. I don't blame them, I love the film, but parts of the film are indeed slow pace, and hard to understand. Even with a love for Quantum physics, space travel and psychology before this film, I had a hard time following what's going on. Like 2001 Space Odyssey, this movie lacks the broad appeal to an audience whom unaware for a need of such deep intelligent research. Maybe, it was a bit overreaching in its direction; as the film feels less a film, a more of a science lecture. You really have to tune in; to get, most of it. The trailers were no help, coming in. The film is about a team of astronauts whom travel through a wormhole in an attempt to find a potentially habitable planet that will sustain humanity, because Earth cannot longer manage life. I found a lot of things jarring in the film, like example, how they use a Saturn like rocket to escape out of Earth's astrosphere, but later on the film, they're able to leave, most planet's upper astrosphere with ease with their little spacecraft. A major error that I have spotted is the matter of the planets where gravitational forces cause such extreme time dilation that an hour on that planet equals seven years for us on Earth. Technically, yes, it's a possible, but the gravitational forces necessary to bring this about, would be so extreme that no planet, let alone people, would survive such gravity pull. Why couldn't they go to Saturn's moons? After all, scientists have pointed out that Saturn's moon Titan possesses an abundance of all the elements necessary to support life. Save you the time, and effect. I know, everyone on Earth has infinite resources, despite large blight dust-clouds, but come on! The movie felt like two movies, mixed together. I think the first half of the film movie is very Sci-fiction, with the second half of the film after the wormhole, a bit Sci-fantasy, because how much, it lacks true science. Even if we can make a wormhole, the equations show that they're unstable and they would collapse upon you if you tried to go through. So, that's where the science fiction comes in. Kip Thorne put an amazing amount of research into the film, but the film does have some moments that you might have to suspend your disbelief in. I'm glad, the second half is that way, because it got really boring in the first half of the film. Way too much talking into the first part of the film. Most of the action and tense moments, play out in the second part. One of the biggest fears in the film is Einstein's special theory of relativity. I think the problem of relativity, played very well in the film as characters are afraid of wasting time. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, the former NASA test pilot-turned-farmer is a great role for him. I love the tense relationship with him, and his daughter, Murph played by Mackenzie Foy (Age 11) & Jessica Chastain (Age 37). You really see the pain that Cooper goes through, when he sees his children, growing up fast in front of him. While the ending is very clunky, it was very emotionally and physically draining to watch. Indeed, Matthew could act. He was the anchor that kept the story, grounded. Still, it was bit a stretch, at times, hard to believe, that his character spend most of his later life, farming, but still able to be an accurate ace pilot who can play a spacecraft through black holes, and dock on spinning out of control space station. Jessica Chastain is great in the secondary role. Anne Hathaway, while overacting in her role as Brand, Coop's co-explorer; was mostly alright, despite her character, doing a lot of stupid selfish things. The rest of the supporting cast were pretty good with their parts. I do love the smart ass robots. I thought the visuals were amazing. Must watch on IMAX. I thought the music by Han Zimmer was absolutely beautiful and really made the dramatic scenes including the end scene with the twist all the more engaging. Still, it was overbearing, and the sound mixer were pretty bad as I couldn't hear the dialogue, when the music is playing. Overall: Despite its faults, it's a good movie.","

I didn't like Inception and got very confused by it.2. I loved Inception and found it very edgy.3. I didn't like Inception, I thought it was actually pretty shallow and boring and it failed to impress me. If you're in category 1, you will probably not like this movie, as this is the very same type of movie.If you're in category 2 , you watch one sci-fi movie ever 3 years or so, if your forehead wrinkles when someone utters a concept as basic in sci-fi as ""asimov laws"" (for instance), if you get easily impressed and proud when you understand a movie that category 1 doesn't, you will love Interstellar.If you're in category 3, you are more than familiar with sci-fi, whether it's movies, TV shows, literature or even video games. Avoid this movie, it will bore you out of your mind and you will get pretty annoyed by category 2 people acting like you're category 1 just because you didn't like a movie that felt challenging to them, and because they can't fathom the possibility that some people are way past this kind of movies and can't just be impressed by it.In other words, this movie was just like Inception, mediocre. And since people really have a hard time with this word, let me just explain what it means: Medi-ocre. The Latin root word medi means ""middle"".Bottomline this is an ""average"" movie for the ""average"" viewer. All the (current) 9.0 IMDb ""average rating"" does is reflecting that fact.","

"roystephen-81252","8 February 2016","I love intelligent sci-fi movies. 2001: A Space Odyssey (the movie Interstellar clearly wants to emulate) was a real masterpiece that still remains unequalled to this day. I have nothing against slow, introspective SF either. I thoroughly enjoyed Tarkovsky's Solaris, for example.It's not that I dislike Nolan's work. Memento was a brilliant movie. I found The Prestige engaging, too. Inception veered a little close to Hollywood bombast and used some dumb clichés, but was still original and interesting.But this one is just plain bad. Worse, it masquerades itself as an intelligent film when it actually makes no sense at all. For me, that type of pretentiousness is the biggest cinematic sin of all. Hence the 'awful' rating.The build-up is extremely long and boring. Later, the first simple docking manoeuvre is presented as if it was the dramatic climax of the movie. The scenes stretches on and on, and the irritating, minimalistic music tells you you're supposed to bite your nail in excitement. I was bored to death instead. The same thing with the mini-climax that cross-cuts scenes on Earth and Dr Mann's planet (when Mann tries to kill Cooper). No matter how hard Nolan tries to suggest some kind of superhuman drama with the painfully long build-up, irritating music, and cross-cutting, apart form his tricks and the tired clichés, there's nothing there. It's still a long way to go until the end, which - not surprisingly, after so much artificial drama - falls completely flat.The big revelation? I knew as soon as Cooper and his daughter found the message 'from beyond' who the sender would turn out to be.","

"Drabble500","21 December 2019","Apart from the fact that I knew what was going to happen as soon as the books appeared, this movie is pseudo-science from a director who thinks he's clever and evidently fools some people into thinking he is. But this isn't a bright movie. The science is schmuck. Carl Sagan had already dealt (brilliantly) with the time travel idea in his series Cosmos. The one certainty of space-time (wormhole or not) is that you cannot go back. The past really is just that, the past.Take out that simple concept and the movie has very little left. So I can only imagine the 10* reviews are by people who never spend time thinking about ... time.And, no, we shouldn't 'rage against the dying of the light.'","

"theromanempire-1","21 November 2014","I had high hopes for this one but the only thing i really loved in the movie was the awesome....SOUNDTRACK.Unfortunately this had flaws in many parts of the plot and showed us things which were unrealistic in many ways and kinda boring.The movie had it's moments and if u are a sci-fi film fan then u can check it out but it's nothing special.2001 was much better poetry movie than this.The characters were predictable and the reasons why the professor did what he did were unrealistic and unreasonable.I will not spoil the movie but u have to wait for 3 hours before u get out of the theater.the movie is too long.Get the O.S.T And that's all u need to remember from that movie.","

"Goose-30","16 November 2014","One of the biggest letdowns to come along in ages. Not even McConaughey can put an interesting spin on this half-baked, ham-fisted rubbish. It's an amateurish mess of clichés, clumsy exposition, pretentious nonsense, cheap manipulation, and predictable twists. I felt like walking out, but I kept thinking at least there might be some stunning visual effects coming up... nope. The space scenes are serviceable at best, the alien planets are either a blank expanse of water or a blank expanse of ice, apocalyptic Earth is just like normal Earth except with some dust blowing around... where exactly did that big budget go?If you dislike this film within the first twenty minutes, don't waste your time sticking around. It doesn't get any better.","

"cole_groth","9 September 2020","Interstellar is the most powerful movie I have ever watched before. This experience is what should define the blockbuster entirely. A brand new idea that challenges the viewer to think, performances that can drive you to tears, editing that feels out of this world, and above all else, a music score that is endlessly watchable that perfectly captures every moment. The drama of this film does not come from a central antagonist, per se (although Matt Damon makes a brilliant villain while he is on screen), but instead, from the simple concept of time.The writing of this whole film pairs with the beautiful graphics to seem extremely scientific, and I would not be surprised if these events could actually happen. So many of the scenes are masterfully laid out, and can be so dramatic. One of the best scenes is when Cooper is leaving, and Murph runs to her father, crying, only to find that he's not staying for her, even after she told him to go. This film is even more powerful later on, when we find out that the person knocking the books off of the shelf, telling him to ""stay"", was actually Cooper, in the future. As the music builds, Cooper is shouting and crying because he knows that this moment could have been prevented, and he would have seen his daughter grow up, but now he will never be able to do that.This is a story about a man who sacrifices everything in his life, for everybody else's life. Learning that the mission was never supposed to succeed is a genuinely fascinating twist, and watching the betrayal on Murph's face as she finds this out is yet another brilliant scene. Matthew McConaughey is so unbelievably perfect in this film, and he seems so genuine of a person that it's hard not to feel bad for him. Every other performance in this music is so unbelievably good, even down to the minor characters. The twists in this movie are beautifully done, and make the movie shine as bright as it possibly could.What absolutely sells the experience is the beautiful sound track by Hans Zimmer. Every piece of music is intense, tear-jerking, and unequivocally beautiful. This movie is an absolute gem and deserves many rewatches. How on earth this film was not even nominated at the academy awards is absolutely beyond me. This is the greatest science fiction movie I have ever seen in my life, and this is certainly Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus.","

"freemantle_uk","15 November 2014","Since completing the Dark Knight Trilogy writer/director/God-to-Nerds Christopher Nolan was free to make any project he wanted and chose to work with his brother to make his sci-fi epic and his own version of 2001: A Space Odyssey, a bold and fantasy film.In the future Earth is dying, the best and brightest have to become farmers. Most crops are failing and the only thing people can grow is corn. Dust storms are constant and Earth is slowing becoming uninhabitable. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a widowed astronaut turned farmer with two children who ends up being asked by NASA to pilot a mission to save mankind by going into a wormhole on Saturn and find a habitable: but doing this meaning leaving his family and possibly never seeing them again.Interstellar is a highly ambitious film and like Inception Nolan threats his audience with the intelligence they deserve. Interstellar is a very complex films with its look at quantum physics, space travel, wormholes and black holes and time and it will require several viewings to truly understand it all. But on a basic level Interstellar story is easy to follow as it is both a story of astronauts going into the unknown to find a way to rescue humanity, the personal story about the relationship of Cooper and his daughter and the important choices people would face in this scenario.The story elements borrowed from 2001: A Space Odyssey as humanity explore an phenomenon left by an mysterious force and a man having to comprehend something beyond human understanding. There is also a similar premise to Danny Boyle's Sunshine as one last crew are sent to save humanity and the Matthew McConaughey sci-fi film Contact.The special effects are fantastic as you would expect and looks glorious, particularly the ice planet. The look of Earth is very much like Looper as Earth as fallen into a state of regression, society looking just to survive and scientific advancement and questions are discouraged. Environmental issues are also touched on as humanity has over used Earth's resources and forced into austerity because of it, people being forced to make do and with the government not investing in research. Interstellar could also been see as a criticism of certain interest groups in America that want to tell children a inaccurate world view and stop scientific research that they see as an offend to their viewpoints.Like 2001: A Space Odyssey Interstellar has themes about human discovery and need for advancement. There are also plot ideas from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Sunshine, Contact and even the Lost in Space film.As well as the sci-fi story there is the human, Earthbound story about the relationship between Cooper and Murph, Cooper's desire to return to Earth and the love the characters share, turning into the love into something quantifiable. The relationship between the two is where the film is most like Contact, as well as its themes about science on Earth. One of my favourite scenes in the film is when Cooper watches a series of videos and he is slowly overcome with emotion, with the camera focused mostly on McConaughey while as he comes overwhelmed.A criticism that has been laid onto Interstellar is that the film sound mixing, with Hans Zimmer's score being very overpowering. But it is fantastic music and Zimmer does some of his best work with Nolan. The music is organ based, being unique and influenced by Bach. And there are times where the film uses silence in space, a homage to Kubrick's sci-fi classic.Interstellar is an ambitious, complex sci-fi film that is rewarding. It is complicated with its scientific theories about space travel and time, yet its story and themes are still accessible for most audiences. A must see for any sci-fi fan.","

"spukmeyer","22 November 2014","This movie is incorrectly classified as science fiction. It is actually anti-science fiction and, by the way, in all other matters a serious insult to any person's intelligence. The problem with directors these days, even supposedly talented ones like Nolan, is that they try to appeal to everyone and end up appealing to no body. Big money talks louder I guess. Damn you Hollywood.But what pisses me off about this movie is its anti-scientific and anti-technological approach. The subliminal message, that perhaps makes most Nolan fan-boys mentally masturbate about, is that you should not care about rationality, you have to use the power of LOVE and screw logic thinking. OK, so why the pseudo-science mambo-jumbo? If you want to do a Terence Malick trick, don't mess around with science. Being a physicist myself I am of course more sensitive to science fiction plot (worm/black) holes - especially these kind that completely suck any credibility out of it. But even if you are not scientifically literate, and this movie surely is not meant to appeal only to scientists, you should feel insulted. I won't go into any details, just because the ""pencil through a paper of sheet"" wormhole explanation or the ""oyster and pearl"" analogy really raised the bar way to low for me to care about it anymore. Sending ""quantum data"" to solve an ""equation""... WTF? Just throw in the ""quantum"" word and that's it. Sorry to tell you, but ""quantum data"" means nothing. There is no such thing. No quantum physicist uses that expression for anything meaningful, especially in the lack of any recognizable context. Surviving through a black-hole trip (cough cough); talking to your Minecraft-designed robot (seriously??) while you're in the ""3 dimensional box, inside a 5 dimensional universe..."" WTF? It's just stupid, childish and downright ridiculous. Pseudo-science rubbish, which pisses off scientists and sends a completely wrong message to everyone else about what science is all about. Science is about rational thought, passion also of course, but mostly about consistent and carefully constructed logical thinking. This movie is the antithesis of any logical thinking. Just because, you know, love. I enjoy a good, deep, emotional story but the crappy pseudo-science completely spoils it. Kids, this is not science fiction. I am deeply disappointed. Thanks for that Mr Nolan!! Comparing this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey is outrageous, both Mr Kubrick and Mr Arthur C Clarke would be deeply embarrassed to find out that their legacy would be turned into this.Save your money and wait for a BR rip, if you really like being intellectually insulted. MR Nolan didn't do anything to deserve getting your money in his bank account.","

It's incredibly moving... please thing about having a Kleenex with you.
It's the story of a man who would die to save his children, but as well for whom this life is not enough. His an explorer, an adventurer, a courageous man and a father. Put all this is your shaker and you get one of the most moving film I have ever watched.

"bricemavillaz","6 July 2021","I'm trough with Nolan since Inception, and this one just hammers all the flaws that were made obvious since the latter.Stylish cinematography and shootyshooty bang bang scenes don't equate to what I'd call a good movie.Starts off pretty good, with a fascinating concept.But Nolan's just good at inventing interesting premises and serving them with -merely- interesting cinematography, and that's about it.He's terrible at dialogues and characters, he's soul-less, boring, robotic, and systematically shoots himself in the foot with high brow concepts he can't develop properly.All of his ""groundbreaking"" ideas always boil down to lacklustre gimmicks, and his movies end up as generic action flicks that barely stand up to turds such as ""die another day"".Inception was derivative as hell, this one was just plain boring and cringy all the way (Hathaway and McConaughey are doing their usual thing : playing as themselves and being beyond obnoxious and annoying), Michael Cane just plays every Michael Cane part in every CN movies, Matt Damon is barely there, the script is bad, the dialogues are snoozy and ridiculous, the ending is an atrocious naive mess (LOVE IS THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAAAGE gimme a break, seriously).Nolan's last 4 movies are utter garbage, and Tenet is by far the worst.I really liked memento. I thought Dark Knight was ok for an immature comic book flick.Objectively, Nolan isn't a good director, he's superficial, only good at visuals, pretentious, and overall boring and self-absorbed. He couldn't write a decent story or interesting characters to save his life, he's about as emotionally gifted as a broken toaster.Really glad that people are finally realizing that Nolan is a one trick pony with Tenet.I think it's high time people acknowledge how mediocre of a director Nolan is.Go shoot music videos and ads Chris, movies just aren't your thing.","

"juneebuggy","25 September 2019","The first time I watched this I could not wait for it to be over, Thought it was the dumbest thing I'd ever seen. Full of plot holes, recycled sci-fi ideas and just plain ridiculousness. The cast is pretty great but I had heard this was meant to be one of those game changer movies, an ""epic sci-fi.? Not so much.Well I caught it on TV yesterday and while I still found weird, lazy story flaws and things that didn't make much sense, I didn't hate it. I got the message they were trying to convey about gravity and time and mankind and love. I finally (somewhat) understood all the positive reviews out there although if you check here there are just as many bad onesInterstellar follows former astronaut, now farmer Mathew McConaughey and his family at some future point on earth when the atmosphere has become inhospitable to human life. McConaughey stumbles upon a sort of NASA headquarters in the back of one of the cornfields and soon embarks on a dangerous mission with Ann Hathaway through a wormhole in order to find a hospitable planet, oh and some time passes.Some of my issues; NASA is in exile right next door to the farm, how convenient, they're living in a dustbowl but only when it suits the filming schedule otherwise its cornfields, sunshine and chasing drones. McConaughey -who is a galaxy and a wormhole away- shows up in his daughters childhood bedroom 40 years later. WTH. Mind blown. Even the earlier ghosting doesn't really explain this bit of mind screwery.","

"TdSmth5","13 November 2014","Cooper is a former NASA test pilot, now farmer. Something has happened to earth and all there is now is dust. Resources are scarce, and fields compete with humans for oxygen, so they'll have to be eliminated. He's got a daughter Murphy and a son Tom. Tom is smart but since he's a boy in a Hollywood movie he's destined to be a farmer and become the bad guy later. Murphy as a girl in a Hollywood movie is destined for greatness. When Cooper and Murphy happen to run into a NASA facility he's introduced to a plan to save humanity from famine.Sometime in the past, NASA sent several ships through a wormhole to find livable planets. They want him now to run a mission to find out which one of these missions was successful. He agrees, Murphy is angry and doesn't want him to leave and Tom, well, he's a boy, so the movie doesn't care about him.So off he goes with a team of 3 others and some robots. Their challenge is time. They can't waste any because as they are traveling through worm holes at high speeds, years are going by on earth and people are dying. They arrive at the first planet which is nothing but water. There, some girl astronaut who looks like Michael Jackson screws up and gets a teammate killed and wastes precious time. The waves on this planet are gigantic and they are in danger. They escape.Years have gone by on earth. They land on the second planet that is nothing buy ice. They wake up the astronaut there who promises them that there is livable space somewhere underneath. But he has a sinister agenda.Meanwhile we learn that the plan by NASA was somewhat doomed from the get-go, that no one thought this team would make it back to earth. That forces Cooper and the girl to try and solve things on their own. And he's got some help from earth. Murphy herself is now a NASA scientist. And since she was little she has had contact with a ""ghost""--some force that tinkered with gravity to give her messages. She, with the ghost, and Cooper racing at the speed of light, will have to figure out a way to save themselves and earthlings.Interstellar had the worst preview of any movie in recent times. After seeing it several times, I had no intention of watching the movie. But to my surprise Interstellar is actually good. Very good. The visuals aren't that compelling though I must say. Sure, it has some neat scenes, but overall for a space movie, this doesn't take advantage of it. We are not treated to cool sights of nebulas and galaxies. It's a smart movie though that doesn't scare away from the physics, but jumps right into it--relativity, worm holes, speed of light, gravity, string theory, multiple dimensions all make an appearance and are handled well. The physics aren't completely accurate nor is the movie plot-hole free, but it's not as obvious or annoying as in other movies.Despite featuring McConaughey in the lead, it is an engrossing movie that gets you involved for the nearly 3 hours. If properly directed in a ""normal"" role, he can actually deliver. Still, 30-45 minutes could have been easily edited out. It makes you think as well, which is a rarity in Hollywood movies. It doesn't dumb things down. The mandatory scene of someone telling a scientist to ""speak English"" is thankfully absent, truly revolutionary! There are even some philosophically meaningful lines. While I don't appreciate the anti-male aspects, at least it does place a lot of emphasis on family, on parenting, which is sorely needed in Western developed countries that are basically going to go extinct because successful, high-functioning people can't figure out a way to make long-term meaningful relationships work. And that is the even more revolutionary theme of Interstellar. It goes against the Hollywood agenda to destroy the family and to advocate for no-strings-attached, no drama, transactional relationships. Instead it places importance on family in this life, and maybe beyond.","

This film is about astronauts and scientists who went to another galaxy to find a new planet for human life. The soundtrack in the film keeps us focused and tense throughout the film. The plot is complex, fascinating and attention-grabbing from the beginning to the very end. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine and many others. Scientists go into space where they have discussions, disagreements, disputes. The main breakthrough in this film was the image of a black hole.

"mb-155","21 September 2015","They spend a vast fortune on firms like this. They must spend so much more to get a big return than say a TV series like Star Trek or Stargate SG1 might so they should get all things right not some right and some wrong – yes? The new frontier stuff like seeing earth from a great distance and the end of the film were both ""far out"" and good. Yet not being able to hear the actors for most of the time is a crime that does not occur with a film like Gravity where the actor's voices are crystal clear.Even at the start we had issues; the three people in the SUV where did the son vanish to and driving back to the combine harvesters with a flat tyre. Not a brilliant start for a serious science fiction film as opposed to less serious science fiction like Edge of Tomorrow which was brilliant all the way through and yes you can hear the actors like Tom Cruise.Why do they always whisper that's not acting if you can't hear them. Matthew McConaughey may be a good actor but why talk in whispers against a background of loud music and sounds and the much more important computer graphics. Little wonder the android type computer says: ""Why are you whispering they can't hear you"".Maybe director Christopher Nolan encourages this as even Anne Hathaway sounded like she was in another room at times. Perhaps they should have use Matt Damon in the lead role because you can at least understand him. At least when he got angry I could hear McConaughey.But we stuck with this film like Starship Troopers even though travelling through the wormhole owes a lot to the TV series Stargate SG1 and yes we could hear Michael Caine.","

"Vartiainen","22 November 2014","Honestly, I was expecting more from Christopher Nolan. The man is capable of unique vision, of scope that comes across only every once in a while. Such as seen in Inception and The Dark Knight. But this? This is still a good movie, but that's all. It's not great, mainly because of limitations in storytelling, dialogue and style.The biggest problem is that Nolan's faults shine through more than usual. His over-reliance on exposition dialogue, his longwindedness and tendency to linger too long in certain scenes. In most of his movies you get the sense that he had one idea too many. Well, in this he had easily two or three ideas too many. This could have been a two hour movie, without a doubt, and it would have been better for it.It also seems to have problems deciding what it's trying to be. Is it a hard scifi epic along the lines of 2001: A Space Odyssey, or something more leaning towards drama and so called space opera. Certain scenes lean more towards the former, some towards latter, and they don't mesh at all.That being said, it's a fine movie. First of all, it's absolutely gorgeous. I have slight problems with the designs of the actual planets, but every single shot of space is jaw-dropping. I also like that they went and paid actual scientists to figure out what a black hole might look like, among other things. That shows dedication and certainly makes for a very memorable visual.The cast is also superb. The problems with the characters stem from the script, not the actors, and all of them have great chemistry together. One of the underlying themes in this movie is the relationship between father and daughter. Both Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy, as well as Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway make for a great pair and I have no complaints about their performances.Alas, I just cannot call Interstellar a great film. The ending alone would ruin it for me, but the whole journey is so needlessly long and slow that I never got into it. The movie has a lot of good ideas - the dying Earth, the robots, the black hole's affect on space-time - but those ideas are poorly realized and the whole just isn't as good as Nolan's previous work. It's worth watching, certainly, and it's not a bad film, not at all. Just a deeply flawed one.","

"trublu215","3 November 2014","Interstellar marks Christopher Nolan's return to the silver screen since ending his Dark Knight trilogy. While Interstellar seems like classic Nolan, it also feels as if he wanted to focus on making the most realistic space film even if the story fell casualty. And it most certainly seems this way. Interstellar has the best effects that I've ever seen in a film. Each shot detailing the vacancy of space, and the planets that orbit gently is so well crafted that it almost makes you forget about the story flaws in the film. While that does remain as a huge advantage that this film has, it also doesn't delude the fact that there are some pretty glaring issues regarding Nolan's story and its characters. The story behind the film starts off as the unlikely hero is tasked with saving the planet...then it starts talking about space and the relation of time and space. While spoon feeding the audience isn't exactly Nolan's forte, it does begin to start sounding like a physics class in some scenes as characters spout off information as if it is supposed to be common knowledge. But, as Nolan intended, this is most definitely not your typical popcorn blockbuster. Interstellar demands multiple viewings and echoes early Stanley Kubrick in style and in pacing but one thing that has kept me from giving this film a higher rating is most definitely the characters. Christopher Nolan can certainly deliver us a GREAT film, his filmography speaks for itself, but Interstellar is one of his few films that features very little in the way of good characters. Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway certainly delivered the goods here in regards to their performances, but their characters themselves were very flawed and not well rounded in the least. Their characters are there, strictly to progress the story when it begins to slow down and with a running time of nearly three hours, it certainly does drag in certain scenes. However, despite it feeling long and bloated, the imagery here is more than enough to captivate you. The technical aspects of this film are EXTRAORDINARY. Everything from the beautiful, flawless cinematography to the robust sound design, everything here is utterly flawless on a technical level. It makes for a truly engrossing theater experience, if nothing else. Overall, Interstellar feels like a film that is bound to divide audiences and while I didn't love the film outright, there's a lot to this film to admire and appreciate.","

"Spondonman","22 March 2015","I'm never too fussed with realism or realistic special effects in movies – after all, similar to millions of other people I only watched a two-dimensional series of images under Persistence Of Vision on a flat screen telly in a corner of my front room tonight. I wasn't actually ""there"" or wanted to be either and I have no intention of reading Einstein or praising or dissing him afterwards either. I wouldn't even bother to create a loop by promising not to denigrate with a So What that this apparently was a film produced and finished on film too.It's a 21st century cgi cartoon update on When Worlds Collide which was a much artier and worthier film than 2001, with a nod to Close Encounters and its breathtaking nonsense taken for sage symbolism again. Convoluted plans coalesce to populate foreign countries, sorry, galaxies as the Earth or at least the American Midwest is slowly dying. It involves going through a Saturnian wormhole in much the same style as a Cosmic Pinball Wizard picking from a list of possible habitations given to ""Us"" by ""Them"", whoever that lot were. Oodles of human schmaltz is ladled on the concoction for good measure as a counterpoint to inter-dimensional gobbledygook to ensure some people's eyes don't glaze over. A few points: Playing Love Is All Around instead may save a lot of time for impatient people; director Christopher Nolan used grizzled Michael Caine yet again, he must be a really big pal; Robbie the Robot from Forbidden Planet seemed incredibly dexterous and more anthropomorphic in comparison to the clunky TARS & Co. on display as AI in here; on that bloody icy planet cool customer Matt Damon certainly had his plans well laid for saying he didn't expect to be ever opened up again; I ask again why is it so fashionable to growl and grunt colloquial dialogue in guttural whispers – I don't expect everyone, or anyone for that matter to be up to Laurence Olivier's standard of diction but we're not all Kings Of Leon fans; somewhat flat when it finally came the long expected but still creepy farewell between father and daughter! The money shots for me were the emotional and fraught Lander craft re-docking with the Endurance scenes, however it was taken so slowly I thought for a while Anne Hathaway had fainted. The cartoonery is routinely spectacular, at eye-cutting edge.Basically: as with Inception this involves a huge leap of faith from the er well-grounded but unwary viewer; get over it and it's entertaining hokum to be watched with a tesseract of salt – I switched on, switched off and enjoyed it. Way too long though, it seemed to last decades.","

"jipvandemunt","18 September 2023","I have waited long before watching this movie. The length of this movie scared me, so I kept postponing watching it. Recently, my fellow students kept reminding me that Interstellar is a must-see, so I tried.I can say one thing: postponing was a mistake. This movie is such a masterpiece. Everything is spot on. The thing I love the most is the music. Hans Zimmer killed it again. Without his compositions this movie would not have worked. The visuals are also beautiful. I never thought a sci-fi movie would feel so real.In short, I can honestly say I would recommend this movie. It is a must-see.","

"oskdyn","9 November 2023","Best movie I have seen in my life
This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. Movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100.","

"cjonesas","13 April 2022","Judging by the cosmically enthusiastic ratings and reviews, I thought that would be an inter-dimensional masterpiece.Well, 2h49 minutes after, I can safely say and acknowledge that, it's a family story between father and daughter, blended and warped scientifically and science-fictionally between earth, space and a wormhole.The story is logic-defying interesting, the acting is above OK and in some cases very good (see my choice of actors), the choice of actors besides Michael Caine, John Lithgow, Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy, a horror, the development for the 21st century mumbo jumbo and for the 22nd century realistic, the VFX genuinely more than good but not ground-breaking stellar as many show endless enthusiasm about it and the outcome / ending as realistic as a rabbit flying hypersonically.Respect Mr. Nolan, but I prefer your Batman saga much more.Screenplay/story: 7Development: 8.5Realism: 8.5Entertainment: 8Acting: 8Filming/cinematography: 8Visual/special effects: 9Music/score: 7.5Depth: 8Logic: 5Flow: 8Adventure/drama/sci-fi: 8.5Ending/closure: 7.","

"TxMike","3 April 2015","I am a Scientist, and I have always been fascinated with travel into space, ever since I looked up in the 1950s with my dad and spotted the Russian Sputnik satellite overhead in the night sky. This movie, ""Interstellar"", is my kind of movie. I saw it at home on Blu-Ray.As one would expect for this type of movie the picture and sound are both superb, and many times the deep, rumbling bass rattled the fireplace grill and the framed posters on my wall. It is long, at 2 hours and 45 minutes to the closing credits, but every minute was attention-grabbing. I will watch it again.July 2023 update: After 8+ years my wife and I watched and enjoyed it again, streaming on Amazon Prime.The setting is the future, not too distant, and Matthew McConaughey is former Astronaut Cooper, now a corn farmer. Where he lives are recurring giant dust storms, a barometer of how close the planet Earth is to no longer being able to support human life. Everyone is worried but also busy surviving.Cooper also has a bright 10-yr-old daughter and together they make sense of some strange happenings in her bedroom, books falling off the shelves, dust making patterns, they figure out some coordinates that take them to the top secret location of the remaining NASA headquarters. In secret they have been developing a space ship capable of going to the outer reaches of the Solar system to encounter a wormhole, they think put there by intelligent beings, to allow passage into a distant system that may have planets that can support human life. Cooper is needed as pilot for the mission, not knowing if he will ever return to his family.One of the scientists making the trip is Anne Hathaway as Brand, daughter of the old scientist leading the project. Plus several others. There is an intelligent robot with Bill Irwin as the voice of TARS. (As an aside, Irwin had a recurring role on the old TV series 'Northern Exposure' and his presence here brought back fond memories.)So the whole story gets pretty complicated and cannot always follow good science. Still it is extremely well presented, with a totally novel ending. Writer/director Nolan borrows from his ""Inception"" bag of tricks, when every hour on a planet near a black hole is like 7 years back home, so everyone on Earth ages far ahead of the crew. Really, really good movie.SPOILERS: (For my own recollection.) In the end Cooper and his ship are being sucked into a black hole, the ship is being ripped apart, he ejects and, instead of being consumed he ends up in a type of matrix behind the walls and bookshelves of his daughter's room, he can see her, he realizes it was actually him who those years earlier had given her the signals. Forward to a few years later, he is on an orbiting sanctuary, while he contemplates joining Brand now on a new planet trying to colonize it.","

"nscoby93","15 August 2022","Nolan strikes gold with his original sci-fi epic Interstellar. From a cinematic perspective this is one of Nolan's best if not the best.Phenomenal cinematography, great story, great acting, great writing, and an absolute master class score from the amazing Hans Zimmer. His original score truly captures the emotion, atmosphere, and story that Nolan portrayed on screen. Great performances from Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine. The supporting cast does not lack here as well. Also to not mention the robot assistants would be a crime TARS and CASE. The voice acting was so well done and they were a great addition to the cast.When I first saw this film it had quite a profound impact on me. The deep themes that Nolan plays with were quite thought provoking. The prominent theme being time in how it affects us and how fast it slips away. One of the greatest things that Nolan does in this film is how well he captures the emptiness and void of space, as well as its beauty and terror. Also the amazing sound design or at times lack there of was truly immersive.The ending is one of the best mind boggling things I've seen in cinema but I can see how it would not work for a lot of people. It did get a bit convoluted and messy, but it worked for me and was a classic Nolan twist.Interstellar I think remains Christopher Nolan's best film since Inception and The Dark knight and just like with Inception I will forever hate myself for not having watched this in IMAX. An exciting thrill ride from beginning to end makes this one of the best sci-fi films of all time.Next up in Nolan marathon Dunkirk -IMDb: 10/10

"loyolite","9 December 2014","OK, I get it ! It's a Nolan movie so everyone hu-ha about it. Well actually no, I do see lots of negative comments about this movie in the message board. While I went in expecting a Nolan movie , I was sadly disappointed. I got used to his style of movies which hold my attention throughout, and can even make me watch the movie a few times. This movie is OK with its sci fi story. It does however drag many many times and goes very slow. A lot of drama, and less science fiction. A lot of talking and less adrenaline pumping scenes. The family drama just doesn't ever stop. The movie is too long. Maybe if the movie was condensed from 169 minutes to just 90, it would have been great !","

"Shaggers","20 June 2022","I will start of this by saying the negatives, which their are few of. The story can at times be a bit off-putting, or even confusing if your not giving full attention. Especially the end which I personally liked alot, but It is a bit odd what happened, and I can see it not making alot of sense for people. The acting is mostly solid but there's a couple actors in here which aren't the best, mainly John Lithgow which he does fine but not good, a few of the side characters, and child actors (though ofc it's not their fault). The shots can occasionally be odd, in how some shots feel too far away to how I think it should be, even though mostly the cinematography is solid.Only the positives. The music in this film is not only brilliant on its own, it is so well put into the film to fit however it's supposed to be used; much more elegant ways then most films. The music is probably my favorite movie soundtrack at the moment too. The cinematography is great at almost all times, the shots on the sides of the ship I think are really cool, alot of shots spin with them, there was a shot that was intentionally blurry in here to fit the mood, and the camera shakes when it's appropriate and is usually still when not. As well I feel the more intense shots are done wonderfully, following very well if needed. Acting performance from Matthew McConaughey I think might be his best performance, which says alot, as well the performance from Anne Hathaway is really great here, and some of her best work. And this is definitely Jessica Chastains best work I've seen. Matt Damon as usual does excellent. And Michael Caine also does pretty alright, even though he feels pretty emotionless for alot of the movie, but also kinda mysterious, which can fit that character. John Lithgow does fine, good for him though, and I like how he did, just not too great. And I could name all the actors but really for the most part they are all good.The sets on this film and effects are top notch. I've heard a lot of the space scenes; namely the one coming out of the wormhole took up to 100 hours to render each frame which definitely shows. The space shots are beautifully detailed, and the sets on earth are great because they actually grew a cornfield.The story of this film is also great, and is executed very well. It's told like alot of Nolan movies though (memento, Dunkirk) where mysteries are introduced throughout, and explained later, and the story is kinda told in reverse to traditional stories. But the story makes perfect sense, up until the very end which I think does, but is debatable. And feels really smart, and scientific. Using actual science to explain alot of this stuff, and properly doing so.I love all the little details they added here too, like every tick on millers planet was one day, that kinda stuff is really cool, doesn't make it much better but just interesting. Which this movie has tons of!Over all I feel it's a 9.2Spoiler portion real quick for this endPeople don't like the end but it feels very right to me, it makes sense in the plot, and is explained fine, but definitely seems a bit unlikely. But feels like a good ending, everything is wrapped up nicely with a bow, and not in a all good way, but just a very nice ending. Not all is made up for at the end either. He's still missed atleast 80 years on earth. While it failed. But my only problem with it is how did they colonize so fast? Still a good ending, and I also like where they imply goes with brands story but never shown.","

"ferguson-6","16 November 2014","Greetings again from the darkness. There are probably three distinct groups that view this as a ""must see"" movie. First, there are the hardcore science lovers – especially those dedicated to space and time. Next would be the core group of Sci-Fi aficionados (those who quote and debate the specifics of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, The Matrix, etc). And finally, those cinephiles who anxiously await the next ground-breaking film of director Christopher Nolan, whose experimental and pioneering methods are quite unique in today's Hollywood.Given that I would be laughed out of the first two groups – exposed as less than a neophyte, you may assume that my discussion of this film will not be steeped in scientific or astrophysical theorem. Instead, this will provide my reaction to what has been one of my two most anticipated films of the year (Birdman being the other).Simply stated, the look of this film is stunning and breath-taking. Its theatrical release comes in many formats, and I chose 70mm. This made for an incredibly rich look with probably the best sound mix I have ever heard. The physical sets were remarkable and as varied as the scene settings: a farm house, a NASA bunker, multiple spacecrafts, and numerous planets. Beyond that, we experienced the effects of blackholes, wormholes and the tesseract. Mr. Nolan's long time cinematographer and collaborator Wally Pfister was off directing his own film (Transcendence), so the very talented Hoyt Van Hoytema joined the team and contributed sterling camera work, including the first ever hand-held IMAX shots. Top this off with Hans Zimmer's complimentary (though sometimes manipulative) score, and Mr. Nolan has produced a technical marvel of which known adjectives lack justice.Take note of the exceptional cast led by the reigning Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyer's Club), and other Oscar winners and nominees Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, John Lithgow, Casey Affleck, and Ellen Burstyn. Beyond these, we also have David Oyelowo, Wes Bentley, William Devane, Topher Grace, David Gyasi, Collette Wolfe, Timothy Chalamet, and an exceptionally fine performance from Mackenzie Foy (who will forever be remembered as the Twilight child of Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson).On the downside, I found myself shocked at some of the dubious and distracting dialogue. At times, the conversations were contradictory and even seemed out of place for the situation, character and movie. In particular, the entire Matt Damon sequence and the Anne Hathaway monologue on ""love"" both struck me as disjointed and awkward. These and other minor annoyances can't be discussed here without noting key plot points, so that's where we will leave it. However, it must be mentioned that the words of Dylan Thomas are so oft repeated, that the phrase ""Do not go gently into that good night"" can now be officially considered fighting words.The works of noted Theoretical Physicist Kip Thorne were the inspiration for the story, and even Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has come out in support of much of the science in the film. Be prepared for brain strain on topics such as space-time continuum (Einstein's Relative Study of Time), gravity, and the aforementioned wormholes, blackholes and tesseracts. The blight depicted in the first hour draws its look and even some closed circuit interviews directly from Ken Burns' documentary The Dust Bowl (2012). Beyond all of the science and lessons of human arrogance and survival, I found the story to be focused on loss  loss of home, loss of loved ones, loss of hope  and balanced by the remarkable human survival instinct. Christopher Nolan deserves much respect for addressing these human emotions and desires with the overwhelming vastness of space, and doing so in a time when Hollywood producers would much rather financially back the next superhero or even a sequel to a 20 year old comedy.","

"areatw","24 March 2017","'Interstellar' is a three hour movie marathon that contains too few redeeming features to make it worth your time. Going into this movie, everybody would have expected an extremely well made, visually beautiful spectacle, and that's what you get. However, everything else about the film is a disappointment.Sitting staring at a screen for three hours is no fun, unless of course you're watching something entertaining enough to take your mind off it. Throughout 'Interstellar', I found my mind wandering, and I must admit to feeling a sense of relief when the whole thing was over. The film just isn't sufficiently interesting to justify such a long running time.Whilst visually impressive, 'Interstellar' is void of fun. In fact it's void of anything that will make you change your expression. This is just one long, pretentious and self-important film that isn't anywhere near as good as the ratings suggest.",NA
"sirnaber","11 November 2014","Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for most of Nolan's (and his brothers') works, but this one just doesn't rise up to the standard of filmmaking that we're used to from these guys. Where to start? The overtly obvious and cliché ending? If you've seen any movie involving space-time puzzles and paradoxes, you see it coming from miles away. One might say that's not the point of the movie, that we should rather see it as a story of love and affection and whatever. Well, sorry folks, the Nolans seem to talk the talk but they can't walk the walk. The ""dramatic"" content of this film is barely above that of a romantic comedy. It relies too heavily on time paradoxes but doesn't really give us the psychological background of the characters, as to why they do what they do. Some cliché shots: explanation of the worm hole is exactly the same as in Event horizon. The girl running after the car of the departing father, only to be held by another loved one, queue dramatic music- wow, I haven't seen that before. The ""beings"" (or us in the future) simplifying their reality so it suits our cognitive capacities-come on Matthew, you've done that movie already! The robots look like Monoliths from 2001. Well, if you're gonna be inspired by Kubrick, be inspired by the sheer emotional and psychological subtlety and precision that makes 2001 a masterpiece.""Human nature"" is a very easy answer to explain both all the evil and all the goodness that is going on. Yeah we have survival instinct, also compassion for our loved ones, which may come into conflict with the overall goal of our survival as species. So where are all these forced-tear-jerker scenes coming from? What else is new since 2001 or Solaris? Is that all there is to it? A movie with this much ambition and hype was supposed to be a milestone in the genre, but instead it is a faint copy, easily forgettable. What we've seen previously from these guys in films like The Following, Memento and also in Dark Knight, hell, even Inception, is that they really know how to create memorable characters with unique insight into their psychological background. None of that complexity is to be found in this movie. The characters are made from cardboard and they feel like repetitions of other sci- fi movie stereotypes. The dramatic substance of the movie, which is literally thrown to our faces every moment, does not live up to the quality of its' technical execution. Sure the visuals are great, but that's to be expected from a $169 million movie. Music is great too, though sometimes overused, but it's Hans Zimmer for crying out loud. What I enjoyed was the layout of the dystopic future, perhaps a little emphasis on how the world came to be that way would have made for a better and more plausible movie(don't even get me started on the absurd physics of this movie. good luck running from a black-hole).Simply put, this film is by no means a 9, and it simply doesn't qualify for the top250 (though of course there are many titles there which don't qualify even for the top875384).",NA
"bwyg","25 November 2014","I'm disappointed. Nolan failed to break out of his mold and make a truly challenging movie. This is one heck of a summer pop corn movie, I'll give it that. But it's not much more than that, and it has perhaps the worst sound design I've heard in 20 years. Nolan himself says in interviews that this is what he wanted -- really loud with dialog that's hard to hear. To make it ""more immersive"" apparently. But if I want immersive, I can go ride my pick of rides at an amusement park. What I want when I go to the theater is for the director to tell a story. And his crappy sound design gets in the way of his telling of his story. And the story is yet another variation on his favorite theme of recursion. Meh. Getting old Chris. Old. And by the end of the movie, so were the endless references to 2001. Sheesh.A good amusement park ride, yes it is. But it's still considerably below the bar set by Gravity last year.",NA
"adamjohns-42575","11 March 2022","Interstellar (2014) -I think it would be easy to call this the 2014 equivalent of '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968), but this one actually has substance and a decent storyline and didn't bore me within the first five minutes. It does seem to make many references to that film too, whilst also having an early 'Star Trek' and 'Lost In Space' (Enterprise/Start of Earth's attempts to explore) vibe about it too.I liked the semi documentary style that they employed at the beginning, but I think that they could have used it more throughout as it would have broken up everything else.It was also well paced to start, but did seem to drag after a while and I think that the ending could have wrapped a bit quicker.I personally might have written out the son to save a bit of time, as he didn't add much to it at all and that could have shortened it by about 15 minutes. I don't mind an epic and I'm happy to sit and watch 3 hour films as long as it's necessary and not just missed opportunities in editing or story boarding.Regarding the actors, someone needs to teach Mr McConaughey about diction, but apart from his drawl that was entirely incoherent at times (Thank the Lord for Subtitles) he did a good job and probably stood out amongst a talented cast that do a good job, but didn't give us anything Oscar worthy otherwise.Although HE did give something pretty Oscar worthy in 'The Martian' (2015) and I suppose that this film shows us what would have happened if Maertt Day-Man had never survived on Mars, I would say that this was only an average performance on his part.He was a bit too similar to his Ripley character from 'The Talented Mr Ripley' (1999) and his traits all seemed a bit obvious, because of that.Michael Caine and John Lithgow are worth noting too, but didn't get a huge amount of screen time to warrant any rapture.As for the special effects, although I don't generally advocate overusing CGI, I think that they could have spared a little more for TARS, etc. At times they looked like something from 1960's 'Doctor Who' and made of the same cheap foil covered cardboardy materials too. I assume that they were a nod to the random slabs in '2001: A Space Odyssey'?I don't have time to read all of the trivia about the science of the film, it's way beyond my failed GCSE science grade anyway, but some of it seems a bit unlikely. That didn't diminish the story it's telling though and I don't think that you need to know quantum mechanics to enjoy it.I did find it curious that it's not an established work of fiction or even based on an article or short story. It's very well thought out, which I don't find to be the case that often for stories of this kind that are purely constructs of the film industry.In some ways you could say that the story has parts that are reflected in 'Ghostbusters: Afterlife' (2021). The house in the middle of nowhere, the warning sounds and so on. At least it certainly reminded me of that.I think like some of the other ""Epic"" films - 'Forrest Gump' (1994) for example, it's one to tune in to no more frequently than every 5 years or so, to enable you to find newness in it and satisfaction of a few hours well spent.There are better sci-fi's out there for my tastes, but I can see that this was well done and could easily become a cult classic.769.08/1000.",NA
"siderite","25 December 2014","If you are one of those people that thought Inception was a really good movie and it made a whole lot of sense, then stop reading this review; you will not agree with it.Interstellar is a movie that I have been waiting for a long time, ever since they released teasers and trailers and a lot of science blogs started talking about it. I held myself away from such discussions, though, because I wanted to have an open mind when I watched it. My verdict: really well done movie that made absolutely no sense, in any number of dimensions. People said that it was inspiring; if it inspires anyone, that's good, but don't come crying to me when they come back disappointed that they cannot hear the symphonic music and the BWAAAAANG in space, like they expected it.I really don't want to spoil anything, so I will stop here. It took a mere 15 minutes for me to start gritting my teeth and it only became worse as time went by for the entire three hour length of this space sham. Prepare yourselves for Nolan's attempt at a Space Odyssey 2001, only with more special effects and no understanding of science whatsoever. It hits all the right emotional buttons and, indeed, if you have the intelligence of a dog, you will love this film at the level that they are so loving towards their masters.Matthew McConaughey is brilliant in his role, all the supporting actors are great, visual effects are good, even if unnecessarily over the top, all the little details are well taken care of... all except a script that makes any sense beyond ""Oh, love, boo hoo!"".Bottom line: my head hurts with angry disappointment. I am at fault for expecting so much from this movie. Another eye candy ego trip from a director that thinks too highly of himself.",NA
"Reviews_of_the_Dead","8 February 2023","This is a movie that I remember seeing in the theater. I believe it was with my buddy of Robert. He's a big Christopher Nolan fan and at that point, I liked everything from him that I had seen. This is one that I put on a list of ones that I wanted to revisit as it blew me away. Jaime and I watched this as part of the Internet Movie Database Top 100 movies poster.What I think makes this movie work the best is the fact that it is set in the future, but it is so grounded that you notice subtle things before realizing it. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former pilot and engineer who now is a farmer. His goal was to go into space, but the missions were abandoned. Earth is in a tough spot. It needs farmers as people are starving. In the process, plants are dying out and humans are over farming. It is taking all of the nutrients out of the soil.Cooper lives with his daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and son, Tom (Timothée Chalamet). Also living with them is Cooper's father-in-law of Donald (John Lithgow). Murph is convinced that there is a ghost in her room. Cooper wants her to look at it logically. He realizes there is a presence which leads to a secret base. Inside of it are the remnants of NASA. Professor Brand (Michael Caine) is working on a team with his daughter, Brand (Anne Hathaway), Doyle (Wes Bentley), Williams(William Devane) and Romilly (David Gyasi). This is just to name a few.The goal is finding a new planet to move humanity to. They've discovered a wormhole by Saturn. Teams have already been sent. They are supposed to relay information back to Earth. It seems like things have gone wrong. The last-ditch effort is to send this team up to figure out if any of the planets are viable. Cooper is asked to pilot the mission. This upsets his daughter of Murph. We see the ramifications years down the line when she grows up to be played by Jessica Chastain. Life on Earth is at the end, but will humanity survive?That is where I'm going to leave my recap and I should state that I left a lot out. This movie runs almost three hours. Surprisingly, it doesn't feel like it. I believe that Jaime and I watched this in two parts. The first section we were shocked to see that we only had an hour left. We were both tired though and that is partly contributed to our newborn daughter, Mackenzie.What I think helps the pacing is that we have a deep story. It is one that even if you're paying attention, you miss a lot. I remembered what the reveal was. Jaime thinks she saw part of this, but didn't think she saw it all the way through. There are sections that felt familiar. The beginning section though is Earth dying. I was telling her that this is based in fact. If memory serves, soybeans helps put nutrients back into the soil. That is why most farmers in the Midwest will plant them periodically. If they don't, there could be a reoccurrence of the dust bowl when the top soil was blown away. This is also why the Sahara Desert is growing. As the population on Earth grows, we could continue to get closer to what is happening here.There is a part of this as this like 2001: A Space Odyssey. They go through the wormhole and to a few different plants. All the while, we are seeing what is happening on Earth. There are also this almost documentary footage that is edited in. When I figured out how that factored into the ending, I loved it. This is just a well-made movie. The cinematography brings these things to life. I don't know if it is factual or not. Nolan does though so that makes me go with it. What I also want to include here is that we get the idea of time travel. It is handled in a different way which is something else I appreciate. There is CGI here, but you need it. It looks great as this had a budget that could do that for sure.I think that makes this work as well is the great cast. McConaughey, Hathaway and Chastain are listed as our leads. They are all good and it is movies like this that make you see why. I'm also going to give a lot of credit to Foy. She is a child here, but the emotions she shows is great. There is also Ellen Burstyn, Lithgow, Chalamet, Oyelowo, Collette Wolfe, Bentley, Devane, Josh Stewart, Casey Affleck and Matt Damon, to just name a few. There is more that I could add on top of it.Now this movie won't be for everyone. I think that it does great things. It isn't the first movie like this, as I've already laid out a classic that this borrows from. What I think this does better is frame a story around it. Being that this came out after, it needed to do something to set it apart. I believe this is my favorite Nolan movie. It is one that I'd say to not get discouraged if you don't understand it. It doesn't do a great job at explaining the science, which is quite complicated. Take what you can and it requires multiple viewings.My Rating: 9 out of 10.",NA
"ahmadsmalik","4 August 2022","After watching Interstellar for the second time it jumped 20 places on my all-time favorite movies from 20th to 1st. I don't know why Matthew McConaughey didn't win another Oscar for his absolute amazing performance; the guy really gives his all when he's on camera. The story isn't your typical, perfunctory alien/space movie but instead centers around how the current generation has the power to make or break the future depending on how they utilize their resources and how some humans tend to be so selfish when hard times come (dialogue at 28 minutes). Moreover, it really is the first movie that really explained the four dimensions of space and time to me in utterly breathtaking fashion. Nolan really managed to make astronomy interesting again and in a world where education is becoming undervalued, inspires us to grow and learn. The movie is filled to the brim with dialogues and lessons that everyone can learn from and understand. Hans Zimmer delivered possibly the greatest ever soundtrack of all time (goosebumps!) to complement the beautiful CGI and remarkable storytelling. Interstellar isn't a movie, its an experience. Unfortunately I cannot give it more than 10 stars because it absolutely does deserve higher.",NA
"franckbossi","2 November 2023","Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into the realms of space exploration, human survival, and the unbreakable bonds of love. With its breathtaking visuals and a hauntingly beautiful score by Hans Zimmer, the film takes audiences on a journey that is as much about the vastness of the universe as it is about the intimate connections between a father and his daughter.Set in a dystopian future where Earth is dying, the narrative follows a group of astronauts, led by the former pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), as they embark on a perilous mission through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humanity. The film beautifully juxtaposes the vast, cold expanse of space with the warmth of human emotions, making it a deeply moving experience.The scientific concepts, including black holes, time dilation, and the theory of relativity, are intricately woven into the plot, making ""Interstellar"" not just a visual spectacle but also a thought-provoking exploration of the mysteries of the universe. While some may argue that the film takes certain liberties with scientific accuracy, it's essential to remember that at its core, ""Interstellar"" is a work of fiction meant to entertain, inspire, and provoke thought.The performances are top-notch, with McConaughey delivering one of his career-best roles. Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine also shine in their respective roles, bringing depth and authenticity to their characters.However, what truly sets ""Interstellar"" apart is its emotional depth. The film's exploration of love, sacrifice, and the passage of time resonates deeply, making it a tear-jerker for many. The relationship between Cooper and his daughter Murph (played by Mackenzie Foy and later by Jessica Chastain) is the beating heart of the story, and their emotional reunion is one of the most touching moments in cinematic history.In conclusion, ""Interstellar"" is a grand, ambitious, and emotionally charged film that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and filmmaking. It's a testament to Nolan's genius that he can craft a narrative that is both epic in scale and deeply personal in emotion. A must-watch for anyone who appreciates cinema that challenges, entertains, and moves the soul.",NA
"The_Swedish_Reviewer","14 May 2020","I believe this is probably one of the most overrated movies ever. A ""2001"" wannabe, full of boring clichés and nonsense sci-fi. Probably the definition of the expression: over-promise, under-deliver.",NA
"french-55318","13 March 2023","What is with all the 10 star marks for this overhype disaster. I can suspend reality with ease, but this asks us to become blythering idiots. Flying around black holes by the seat of your pants and people are like, yeah that's the ticket. Give me a break. Besides that the actors are constantly crying or performing unbelievable acts against physics, is the annoying editing where they keep phasing out a scene into another totally unrelated scene. Mathew fearlessly flies us to from one galaxy to the next in search of a home. The audience, so easily impressed find it facsinating and can't wait to see Mathew worm his way out of the most massive tidal wave ever, only to navigate his ship into docking with an out of control mothership. Then ends behind a multi-dimensional bookshelf. THe crowd applauds like trained seal. Horrible Sci-Fi.",NA
