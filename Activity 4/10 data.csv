"1","Is ChatGPT the Future of Causal Text Mining? A Comprehensive Evaluation and Analysis","Takehiro Takayanagi, Masahiro Suzuki, Ryotaro Kobayashi, Hiroki Sakaji, Kiyoshi Izumi","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","Causality is fundamental in human cognition and has drawn attention in diverse research fields. With growing volumes of textual data, discerning causalities within text data is crucial, and causal text mining plays a pivotal role in extracting meaningful patterns. This study conducts comprehensive evaluations of ChatGPT's causal text mining capabilities. Firstly, we introduce a benchmark that extends beyond general English datasets, including domain-specific and non-English datasets. We also provide an evaluation framework to ensure fair comparisons between ChatGPT and previous approaches. Finally, our analysis outlines the limitations and future challenges in employing ChatGPT for causal text mining. Specifically, our analysis reveals that ChatGPT serves as a good starting point for various datasets. However, when equipped with a sufficient amount of training data, previous models still surpass ChatGPT's performance. Additionally, ChatGPT suffers from the tendency to falsely recognize non-causal sequences as causal sequences. These issues become even more pronounced with advanced versions of the model, such as GPT-4. In addition, we highlight the constraints of ChatGPT in handling complex causality types, including both intra/inter-sentential and implicit causality. The model also faces challenges with effectively leveraging in-context learning and domain adaptation. We release our code to support further research and development in this field.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 12:19:04 UTC (711 KB)[v2] Fri, 23 Feb 2024 11:50:18 UTC (712 KB)"
"2","HunFlair2 in a cross-corpus evaluation of biomedical named entity recognition and normalization tools","Mario Sänger, Samuele Garda, Xing David Wang, Leon Weber-Genzel, Pia Droop, Benedikt Fuchs, Alan Akbik, Ulf Leser","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","With the exponential growth of the life science literature, biomedical text mining (BTM) has become an essential technology for accelerating the extraction of insights from publications. Identifying named entities (e.g., diseases, drugs, or genes) in texts and their linkage to reference knowledge bases are crucial steps in BTM pipelines to enable information aggregation from different documents. However, tools for these two steps are rarely applied in the same context in which they were developed. Instead, they are applied in the wild, i.e., on application-dependent text collections different from those used for the tools' training, varying, e.g., in focus, genre, style, and text type. This raises the question of whether the reported performance of BTM tools can be trusted for downstream applications. Here, we report on the results of a carefully designed cross-corpus benchmark for named entity extraction, where tools were applied systematically to corpora not used during their training. Based on a survey of 28 published systems, we selected five for an in-depth analysis on three publicly available corpora encompassing four different entity types. Comparison between tools results in a mixed picture and shows that, in a cross-corpus setting, the performance is significantly lower than the one reported in an in-corpus setting. HunFlair2 showed the best performance on average, being closely followed by PubTator. Our results indicate that users of BTM tools should expect diminishing performances when applying them in the wild compared to original publications and show that further research is necessary to make BTM tools more robust.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 18:58:18 UTC (4,671 KB)[v2] Tue, 20 Feb 2024 13:10:27 UTC (4,671 KB)"
"3","Construction of a Syntactic Analysis Map for Yi Shui School through Text Mining and Natural Language Processing Research","Hanqing Zhao, Yuehan Li","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","Entity and relationship extraction is a crucial component in natural language processing tasks such as knowledge graph construction, question answering system design, and semantic analysis. Most of the information of the Yishui school of traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is stored in the form of unstructured classical Chinese text. The key information extraction of TCM texts plays an important role in mining and studying the academic schools of TCM. In order to solve these problems efficiently using artificial intelligence methods, this study constructs a word segmentation and entity relationship extraction model based on conditional random fields under the framework of natural language processing technology to identify and extract the entity relationship of traditional Chinese medicine texts, and uses the common weighting technology of TF-IDF information retrieval and data mining to extract important key entity information in different ancient books. The dependency syntactic parser based on neural network is used to analyze the grammatical relationship between entities in each ancient book article, and it is represented as a tree structure visualization, which lays the foundation for the next construction of the knowledge graph of Yishui school and the use of artificial intelligence methods to carry out the research of TCM academic schools.","Fri, 16 Feb 2024 14:59:55 UTC (561 KB)"
"4","Multi-Fidelity Methods for Optimization: A Survey","Ke Li, Fan Li","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Real-world black-box optimization often involves time-consuming or costly experiments and simulations. Multi-fidelity optimization (MFO) stands out as a cost-effective strategy that balances high-fidelity accuracy with computational efficiency through a hierarchical fidelity approach. This survey presents a systematic exploration of MFO, underpinned by a novel text mining framework based on a pre-trained language model. We delve deep into the foundational principles and methodologies of MFO, focusing on three core components -- multi-fidelity surrogate models, fidelity management strategies, and optimization techniques. Additionally, this survey highlights the diverse applications of MFO across several key domains, including machine learning, engineering design optimization, and scientific discovery, showcasing the adaptability and effectiveness of MFO in tackling complex computational challenges. Furthermore, we also envision several emerging challenges and prospects in the MFO landscape, spanning scalability, the composition of lower fidelities, and the integration of human-in-the-loop approaches at the algorithmic level. We also address critical issues related to benchmarking and the advancement of open science within the MFO community. Overall, this survey aims to catalyze further research and foster collaborations in MFO, setting the stage for future innovations and breakthroughs in the field.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 00:52:34 UTC (35,662 KB)"
"5","A step towards the integration of machine learning and small area estimation","Tomasz Żądło, Adam Chwila","Methodology (stat.ME)","The use of machine-learning techniques has grown in numerous research areas. Currently, it is also widely used in statistics, including the official statistics for data collection (e.g. satellite imagery, web scraping and text mining, data cleaning, integration and imputation) but also for data analysis. However, the usage of these methods in survey sampling including small area estimation is still very limited. Therefore, we propose a predictor supported by these algorithms which can be used to predict any population or subpopulation characteristics based on cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Machine learning methods have already been shown to be very powerful in identifying and modelling complex and nonlinear relationships between the variables, which means that they have very good properties in case of strong departures from the classic assumptions. Therefore, we analyse the performance of our proposal under a different set-up, in our opinion of greater importance in real-life surveys. We study only small departures from the assumed model, to show that our proposal is a good alternative in this case as well, even in comparison with optimal methods under the model. What is more, we propose the method of the accuracy estimation of machine learning predictors, giving the possibility of the accuracy comparison with classic methods, where the accuracy is measured as in survey sampling practice. The solution of this problem is indicated in the literature as one of the key issues in integration of these approaches. The simulation studies are based on a real, longitudinal dataset, freely available from the Polish Local Data Bank, where the prediction problem of subpopulation characteristics in the last period, with ""borrowing strength"" from other subpopulations and time periods, is considered.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 09:43:17 UTC (110 KB)"
"6","How to Refactor this Code? An Exploratory Study on Developer-ChatGPT Refactoring Conversations","Eman Abdullah AlOmar, Anushkrishna Venkatakrishnan, Mohamed Wiem Mkaouer, Christian D. Newman, Ali Ouni","Software Engineering (cs.SE)","Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have gained widespread popularity and usage in various software engineering tasks, including refactoring, testing, code review, and program comprehension. Despite recent studies delving into refactoring documentation in commit messages, issues, and code review, little is known about how developers articulate their refactoring needs when interacting with ChatGPT. In this paper, our goal is to explore conversations between developers and ChatGPT related to refactoring to better understand how developers identify areas for improvement in code and how ChatGPT addresses developers' needs. Our approach relies on text mining refactoring-related conversations from 17,913 ChatGPT prompts and responses, and investigating developers' explicit refactoring intention. Our results reveal that (1) developer-ChatGPT conversations commonly involve generic and specific terms/phrases; (2) developers often make generic refactoring requests, while ChatGPT typically includes the refactoring intention; and (3) various learning settings when prompting ChatGPT in the context of refactoring. We envision that our findings contribute to a broader understanding of the collaboration between developers and AI models, in the context of code refactoring, with implications for model improvement, tool development, and best practices in software engineering.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 19:24:01 UTC (2,570 KB)"
"7","Quantifying Similarity: Text-Mining Approaches to Evaluate ChatGPT and Google Bard Content in Relation to BioMedical Literature","Jakub Klimczak, Ahmed Abdeen Hamed","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","Background: The emergence of generative AI tools, empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs), has shown powerful capabilities in generating content. To date, the assessment of the usefulness of such content, generated by what is known as prompt engineering, has become an interesting research question. Objectives Using the mean of prompt engineering, we assess the similarity and closeness of such contents to real literature produced by scientists. Methods In this exploratory analysis, (1) we prompt-engineer ChatGPT and Google Bard to generate clinical content to be compared with literature counterparts, (2) we assess the similarities of the contents generated by comparing them with counterparts from biomedical literature. Our approach is to use text-mining approaches to compare documents and associated bigrams and to use network analysis to assess the terms' centrality. Results The experiments demonstrated that ChatGPT outperformed Google Bard in cosine document similarity (38% to 34%), Jaccard document similarity (23% to 19%), TF-IDF bigram similarity (47% to 41%), and term network centrality (degree and closeness). We also found new links that emerged in ChatGPT bigram networks that did not exist in literature bigram networks. Conclusions: The obtained similarity results show that ChatGPT outperformed Google Bard in document similarity, bigrams, and degree and closeness centrality. We also observed that ChatGPT offers linkage to terms that are connected in the literature. Such connections could inspire asking interesting questions and generate new hypotheses.","Fri, 19 Jan 2024 17:14:46 UTC (3,859 KB)[v2] Sun, 11 Feb 2024 22:50:17 UTC (3,857 KB)"
"8","Leveraging Social Media Data to Identify Factors Influencing Public Attitude Towards Accessibility, Socioeconomic Disparity and Public Transportation","Khondhaker Al Momin, Arif Mohaimin Sadri, Md Sami Hasnine","Computers and Society (cs.CY)","This study proposes a novel method to understand the factors affecting individuals' perception of transport accessibility, socioeconomic disparity, and public infrastructure. As opposed to the time consuming and expensive survey-based approach, this method can generate organic large-scale responses from social media and develop statistical models to understand individuals' perceptions of various transportation issues. This study retrieved and analyzed 36,098 tweets from New York City from March 19, 2020, to May 15, 2022. A state-of-the-art natural language processing algorithm is used for text mining and classification. A data fusion technique has been adopted to generate a series of socioeconomic traits that are used as explanatory variables in the model. The model results show that females and individuals of Asian origin tend to discuss transportation accessibility more than their counterparts, with those experiencing high neighborhood traffic also being more vocal. However, disadvantaged individuals, including the unemployed and those living in low-income neighborhoods or in areas with high natural hazard risks, tend to communicate less about such issues. As for socioeconomic disparity, individuals of Asian origin and those experiencing various types of air pollution are more likely to discuss these topics on Twitter, often with a negative sentiment. However, unemployed, or disadvantaged individuals, as well as those living in areas with high natural hazard risks or expected losses, are less inclined to tweet about this subject. Lack of internet accessibility could be a reason why many disadvantaged individuals do not tweet about transport accessibility and subsidized internet could be a possible solution.","Mon, 22 Jan 2024 06:51:29 UTC (857 KB)"
"9","A Scalable and Automated Framework for Tracking the likely Adoption of Emerging Technologies","Lowri Williams, Eirini Anthi, Pete Burnap","Computers and Society (cs.CY)","While new technologies are expected to revolutionise and become game-changers in improving the efficiencies and practises of our daily lives, it is also critical to investigate and understand the barriers and opportunities faced by their adopters. Such findings can serve as an additional feature in the decision-making process when analysing the risks, costs, and benefits of adopting an emerging technology in a particular setting. Although several studies have attempted to perform such investigations, these approaches adopt a qualitative data collection methodology which is limited in terms of the size of the targeted participant group and is associated with a significant manual overhead when transcribing and inferring results. This paper presents a scalable and automated framework for tracking likely adoption and/or rejection of new technologies from a large landscape of adopters. In particular, a large corpus of social media texts containing references to emerging technologies was compiled. Text mining techniques were applied to extract sentiments expressed towards technology aspects. In the context of the problem definition herein, we hypothesise that the expression of positive sentiment infers an increase in the likelihood of impacting a technology user's acceptance to adopt, integrate, and/or use the technology, and negative sentiment infers an increase in the likelihood of impacting the rejection of emerging technologies by adopters. To quantitatively test our hypothesis, a ground truth analysis was performed to validate that the sentiment captured by the text mining approach is comparable to the results given by human annotators when asked to label whether such texts positively or negatively impact their outlook towards adopting an emerging technology.","Tue, 16 Jan 2024 16:42:14 UTC (984 KB)"
"10","Building Contextual Knowledge Graphs for Personalized Learning Recommendations using Text Mining and Semantic Graph Completion","Hasan Abu-Rasheed, Mareike Dornhöfer, Christian Weber, Gábor Kismihók, Ulrike Buchmann, Madjid Fathi","Information Retrieval (cs.IR)","Modelling learning objects (LO) within their context enables the learner to advance from a basic, remembering-level, learning objective to a higher-order one, i.e., a level with an application- and analysis objective. While hierarchical data models are commonly used in digital learning platforms, using graph-based models enables representing the context of LOs in those platforms. This leads to a foundation for personalized recommendations of learning paths. In this paper, the transformation of hierarchical data models into knowledge graph (KG) models of LOs using text mining is introduced and evaluated. We utilize custom text mining pipelines to mine semantic relations between elements of an expert-curated hierarchical model. We evaluate the KG structure and relation extraction using graph quality-control metrics and the comparison of algorithmic semantic-similarities to expert-defined ones. The results show that the relations in the KG are semantically comparable to those defined by domain experts, and that the proposed KG improves representing and linking the contexts of LOs through increasing graph communities and betweenness centrality.","Wed, 24 Jan 2024 17:27:08 UTC (4,217 KB)"
